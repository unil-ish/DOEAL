I have provided the analysis of emotions in the text you provided. However, due to the length of the text, I have divided the analysis into multiple parts. Here is the analysis for the first part of the text:

```json
{
  "FictionalCharacters": [
    {
      "id": "Starbuck",
      "feels": [
        {
          "name": "Fear",
          "hasIntensity": 0.7,
          "quote": "The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuckâ€™s heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.",
          "causedBy": {
            "id": "event1",
            "name": "Seeing the muskets"
          },
          "hasObject": {
            "id": "object1",
            "name": "Muskets"
          },
          "exactPlace": "Cabin"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Events": [
    {
      "id": "event1",
      "name": "Seeing the muskets"
    }
  ],
  "Objects": [
    {
      "id": "object1",
      "name": "Muskets"
    }
  ],
  "Places": [
    {
      "id": "place1",
      "name": "Cabin",
      "description": "Isolated subterraneousness made a certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements."
    }
  ]
}
```

Let me know if you would like to continue with the analysis of the remaining parts of the text.
