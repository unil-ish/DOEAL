  "content": "The end of their conversation with the Signora Brunoni was that it was\nagreed that he should be placed under medical advice, and for any\nexpense incurred in procuring this Lady Glenmire promised to hold\nherself responsible, and had accordingly gone to Mr Hoggins to beg him\nto ride over to the “Rising Sun” that very afternoon, and examine into\nthe signor’s real state; and, as Miss Pole said, if it was desirable to\nremove him to Cranford to be more immediately under Mr Hoggins’s eye,\nshe would undertake to see for lodgings and arrange about the rent.  Mrs\nRoberts had been as kind as could be all throughout, but it was evident\nthat their long residence there had been a slight inconvenience.Before Miss Pole left us, Miss Matty and I were as full of the morning’s\nadventure as she was.  We talked about it all the evening, turning it in\nevery possible light, and we went to bed anxious for the morning, when\nwe should surely hear from someone what Mr Hoggins thought and\nrecommended; for, as Miss Matty observed, though Mr Hoggins did say\n“Jack’s up,” “a fig for his heels,” and called Preference “Pref.” she\nbelieved he was a very worthy man and a very clever surgeon.  Indeed, we\nwere rather proud of our doctor at Cranford, as a doctor.  We often\nwished, when we heard of Queen Adelaide or the Duke of Wellington being\nill, that they would send for Mr Hoggins; but, on consideration, we were\nrather glad they did not, for, if we were ailing, what should we do if\nMr Hoggins had been appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Family?\n As a surgeon we were proud of him; but as a man—or rather, I should\nsay, as a gentleman—we could only shake our heads over his name and\nhimself, and wished that he had read Lord Chesterfield’s Letters in the\ndays when his manners were susceptible of improvement.  Nevertheless, we\nall regarded his dictum in the signor’s case as infallible, and when he\nsaid that with care and attention he might rally, we had no more fear\nfor him."

Miss Pole looked out clean and comfortable, if homely,\nlodgings; Miss Matty sent the sedan-chair for him, and Martha and I\naired it well before it left Cranford by holding a warming-pan full of\nred-hot coals in it, and then shutting it up close, smoke and all, until\nthe time when he should get into it at the “Rising Sun.”  Lady Glenmire\nundertook the medical department under Mr Hoggins’s directions, and\nrummaged up all Mrs Jamieson’s medicine glasses, and spoons, and\nbed-tables, in a free-and-easy way, that made Miss Matty feel a little\nanxious as to what that lady and Mr Mulliner might say, if they knew.\nMrs Forrester made some of the bread-jelly, for which she was so famous,\nto have ready as a refreshment in the lodgings when he should arrive.  A\npresent of this bread-jelly was the highest mark of favour dear Mrs\nForrester could confer.  Miss Pole had once asked her for the receipt,\nbut she had met with a very decided rebuff; that lady told her that she\ncould not part with it to any one during her life, and that after her\ndeath it was bequeathed, as her executors would find, to Miss Matty.\nWhat Miss Matty, or, as Mrs Forrester called her (remembering the clause\nin her will and the dignity of the occasion), Miss Matilda Jenkyns—might\nchoose to do with the receipt when it came into her possession—whether\nto make it public, or to hand it down as an heirloom—she did not know,\nnor would she dictate.  And a mould of this admirable, digestible,\nunique bread-jelly was sent by Mrs Forrester to our poor sick conjuror.\nWho says that the aristocracy are proud?  Here was a lady by birth a\nTyrrell, and descended from the great Sir Walter that shot King Rufus,\nand in whose veins ran the blood of him who murdered the little princes\nin the Tower, going every day to see what dainty dishes she could\nprepare for Samuel Brown, a mountebank!  But, indeed, it was wonderful\nto see what kind feelings were called out by this poor man’s coming\namongst us.  And also wonderful to see how the great Cranford panic,\nwhich had been occasioned by his first coming in his Turkish dress,\nmelted away into thin air on his second coming—pale and feeble, and with\nhis heavy, filmy eyes, that only brightened a very little when they fell\nupon the countenance of his faithful wife, or their pale and sorrowful\nlittle girl."

I daresay it was that finding out\nthat he, who had first excited our love of the marvellous by his\nunprecedented arts, had not sufficient every-day gifts to manage a\nshying horse, made us feel as if we were ourselves again.  Miss Pole\ncame with her little basket at all hours of the evening, as if her\nlonely house and the unfrequented road to it had never been infested by\nthat “murderous gang”; Mrs Forrester said she thought that neither Jenny\nnor she need mind the headless lady who wept and wailed in Darkness\nLane, for surely the power was never given to such beings to harm those\nwho went about to try to do what little good was in their power, to\nwhich Jenny tremblingly assented; but the mistress’s theory had little\neffect on the maid’s practice until she had sewn two pieces of red\nflannel in the shape of a cross on her inner garment.I found Miss Matty covering her penny ball—the ball that she used to\nroll under her bed—with gay-coloured worsted in rainbow stripes.“My dear,” said she, “my heart is sad for that little careworn child.\nAlthough her father is a conjuror, she looks as if she had never had a\ngood game of play in her life.  I used to make very pretty balls in this\nway when I was a girl, and I thought I would try if I could not make\nthis one smart and take it to Phoebe this afternoon.

Indeed, Lady Glenmire said she never\nhad heard of any actual robberies, except that two little boys had\nstolen some apples from Farmer Benson’s orchard, and that some eggs had\nbeen missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward’s stall.  But that was\nexpecting too much of us; we could not acknowledge that we had only had\nthis small foundation for all our panic.  Miss Pole drew herself up at\nthis remark of Lady Glenmire’s, and said “that she wished she could\nagree with her as to the very small reason we had had for alarm, but\nwith the recollection of a man disguised as a woman who had endeavoured\nto force himself into her house while his confederates waited outside;\nwith the knowledge gained from Lady Glenmire herself, of the footprints\nseen on Mrs Jamieson’s flower borders; with the fact before her of the\naudacious robbery committed on Mr Hoggins at his own door”—But here Lady\nGlenmire broke in with a very strong expression of doubt as to whether\nthis last story was not an entire fabrication founded upon the theft of\na cat; she grew so red while she was saying all this that I was not\nsurprised at Miss Pole’s manner of bridling up, and I am certain, if\nLady Glenmire had not been “her ladyship,” we should have had a more\nemphatic contradiction than the “Well, to be sure!” and similar\nfragmentary ejaculations, which were all that she ventured upon in my\nlady’s presence.  But when she was gone Miss Pole began a long\ncongratulation to Miss Matty that so far they had escaped marriage,\nwhich she noticed always made people credulous to the last degree;\nindeed, she thought it argued great natural credulity in a woman if she\ncould not keep herself from being married; and in what Lady Glenmire had\nsaid about Mr Hoggins’s robbery we had a specimen of what people came to\nif they gave way to such a weakness; evidently Lady Glenmire would\nswallow anything if she could believe the poor vamped-up story about a\nneck of mutton and a pussy with which he had tried to impose on Miss\nPole, only she had always been on her guard against believing too much\nof what men said."

In a little while she continued—“But, after all, I have not told you the truth.  It is so long ago, and\nno one ever knew how much I thought of it at the time, unless, indeed,\nmy dear mother guessed; but I may say that there was a time when I did\nnot think I should have been only Miss Matty Jenkyns all my life; for\neven if I did meet with any one who wished to marry me now (and, as Miss\nPole says, one is never too safe), I could not take him—I hope he would\nnot take it too much to heart, but I could _not_ take him—or any one but\nthe person I once thought I should be married to; and he is dead and\ngone, and he never knew how it all came about that I said ‘No,’ when I\nhad thought many and many a time—Well, it’s no matter what I thought.\nGod ordains it all, and I am very happy, my dear.

It would be to some people\nrather a sad way of telling their lives,” (a tear dropped upon my hand\nat these words)—“I don’t mean that mine has been sad, only so very\ndifferent to what I expected.  I remember, one winter’s evening, sitting\nover our bedroom fire with Deborah—I remember it as if it were\nyesterday—and we were planning our future lives, both of us were\nplanning, though only she talked about it.  She said she should like to\nmarry an archdeacon, and write his charges; and you know, my dear, she\nnever was married, and, for aught I know, she never spoke to an\nunmarried archdeacon in her life.  I never was ambitious, nor could I\nhave written charges, but I thought I could manage a house (my mother\nused to call me her right hand), and I was always so fond of little\nchildren—the shyest babies would stretch out their little arms to come\nto me; when I was a girl, I was half my leisure time nursing in the\nneighbouring cottages; but I don’t know how it was, when I grew sad and\ngrave—which I did a year or two after this time—the little things drew\nback from me, and I am afraid I lost the knack, though I am just as fond\nof children as ever, and have a strange yearning at my heart whenever I\nsee a mother with her baby in her arms.  Nay, my dear” (and by a sudden\nblaze which sprang up from a fall of the unstirred coals, I saw that her\neyes were full of tears—gazing intently on some vision of what might\nhave been), “do you know I dream sometimes that I have a little\nchild—always the same—a little girl of about two years old; she never\ngrows older, though I have dreamt about her for many years.  I don’t\nthink I ever dream of any words or sound she makes; she is very\nnoiseless and still, but she comes to me when she is very sorry or very\nglad, and I have wakened with the clasp of her dear little arms round my\nneck.  Only last night—perhaps because I had gone to sleep thinking of\nthis ball for Phoebe—my little darling came in my dream, and put up her\nmouth to be kissed, just as I have seen real babies do to real mothers\nbefore going to bed.  But all this is nonsense, dear! only don’t be\nfrightened by Miss Pole from being married.  I can fancy it may be a\nvery happy state, and a little credulity helps one on through life very\nsmoothly—better than always doubting and doubting and seeing\ndifficulties and disagreeables in everything.”"

And yet again, it was an encouragement to see\nhow, through all their cares and sorrows, they thought of each other and\nnot of themselves; and how keen were their joys, if they only passed\nthrough each other, or through the little Phoebe.The signora told me, one day, a good deal about their lives up to this\nperiod.  It began by my asking her whether Miss Pole’s story of the\ntwin-brothers were true; it sounded so wonderful a likeness, that I\nshould have had my doubts, if Miss Pole had not been unmarried.  But the\nsignora, or (as we found out she preferred to be called) Mrs Brown, said\nit was quite true; that her brother-in-law was by many taken for her\nhusband, which was of great assistance to them in their profession;\n“though,” she continued, “how people can mistake Thomas for the real\nSignor Brunoni, I can’t conceive; but he says they do; so I suppose I\nmust believe him.  Not but what he is a very good man; I am sure I don’t\nknow how we should have paid our bill at the ‘Rising Sun’ but for the\nmoney he sends; but people must know very little about art if they can\ntake him for my husband.  Why, Miss, in the ball trick, where my husband\nspreads his fingers wide, and throws out his little finger with quite an\nair and a grace, Thomas just clumps up his hand like a fist, and might\nhave ever so many balls hidden in it.  Besides, he has never been in\nIndia, and knows nothing of the proper sit of a turban.”“Have you been in India?” said I, rather astonished."

Sam was a sergeant in the 31st; and when\nthe regiment was ordered to India, I drew a lot to go, and I was more\nthankful than I can tell; for it seemed as if it would only be a slow\ndeath to me to part from my husband.  But, indeed, ma’am, if I had known\nall, I don’t know whether I would not rather have died there and then\nthan gone through what I have done since.  To be sure, I’ve been able to\ncomfort Sam, and to be with him; but, ma’am, I’ve lost six children,”\nsaid she, looking up at me with those strange eyes that I’ve never\nnoticed but in mothers of dead children—with a kind of wild look in\nthem, as if seeking for what they never more might find.  “Yes!  Six\nchildren died off, like little buds nipped untimely, in that cruel\nIndia.  I thought, as each died, I never could—I never would—love a\nchild again; and when the next came, it had not only its own love, but\nthe deeper love that came from the thoughts of its little dead brothers\nand sisters.  And when Phoebe was coming, I said to my husband, ‘Sam,\nwhen the child is born, and I am strong, I shall leave you; it will cut\nmy heart cruel; but if this baby dies too, I shall go mad; the madness\nis in me now; but if you let me go down to Calcutta, carrying my baby\nstep by step, it will, maybe, work itself off; and I will save, and I\nwill hoard, and I will beg—and I will die, to get a passage home to\nEngland, where our baby may live?’  God bless him! he said I might go;\nand he saved up his pay, and I saved every pice I could get for washing\nor any way; and when Phoebe came, and I grew strong again, I set off.\nIt was very lonely; through the thick forests, dark again with their\nheavy trees—along by the river’s side (but I had been brought up near\nthe Avon in Warwickshire, so that flowing noise sounded like home)—from\nstation to station, from Indian village to village, I went along,\ncarrying my child.  I had seen one of the officer’s ladies with a little\npicture, ma’am—done by a Catholic foreigner, ma’am—of the Virgin and the\nlittle Saviour, ma’am.  She had him on her arm, and her form was softly\ncurled round him, and their cheeks touched.  Well, when I went to bid\ngood-bye to this lady, for whom I had washed, she cried sadly; for she,\ntoo, had lost her children, but she had not another to save, like me;\nand I was bold enough to ask her would she give me that print.  And she\ncried the more, and said her children were with that little blessed\nJesus; and gave it me, and told me that she had heard it had been\npainted on the bottom of a cask, which made it have that round shape.\nAnd when my body was very weary, and my heart was sick (for there were\ntimes when I misdoubted if I could ever reach my home, and there were\ntimes when I thought of my husband, and one time when I thought my baby\nwas dying), I took out that picture and looked at it, till I could have\nthought the mother spoke to me, and comforted me.  And the natives were\nvery kind.  We could not understand one another; but they saw my baby on\nmy breast, and they came out to me, and brought me rice and milk, and\nsometimes flowers—I have got some of the flowers dried.  Then, the next\nmorning, I was so tired; and they wanted me to stay with them—I could\ntell that—and tried to frighten me from going into the deep woods,\nwhich, indeed, looked very strange and dark; but it seemed to me as if\nDeath was following me to take my baby away from me; and as if I must go\non, and on—and I thought how God had cared for mothers ever since the\nworld was made, and would care for me; so I bade them good-bye, and set\noff afresh.  And once when my baby was ill, and both she and I needed\nrest, He led me to a place where I found a kind Englishman lived, right\nin the midst of the natives.”"

And I got as servant to an invalid lady, who\ngrew quite fond of my baby aboard-ship; and, in two years’ time, Sam\nearned his discharge, and came home to me, and to our child.

I shall think all people of that name are kind; for here\nis that nice old lady who comes every day to take Phoebe a walk!”But an idea had flashed through my head; could the Aga Jenkyns be the\nlost Peter?  True he was reported by many to be dead.  But, equally\ntrue, some had said that he had arrived at the dignity of Great Lama of\nThibet. Miss Matty thought he was alive.

He said he could not help thinking of a passage in Dickens, which\nspoke of a chorus in which every man took the tune he knew best, and\nsang it to his own satisfaction.  So, at this charitable committee,\nevery lady took the subject uppermost in her mind, and talked about it\nto her own great contentment, but not much to the advancement of the\nsubject they had met to discuss.  But even that committee could have\nbeen nothing to the Cranford ladies when I attempted to gain some clear\nand definite information as to poor Peter’s height, appearance, and when\nand where he was seen and heard of last.  For instance, I remember\nasking Miss Pole (and I thought the question was very opportune, for I\nput it when I met her at a call at Mrs Forrester’s, and both the ladies\nhad known Peter, and I imagined that they might refresh each other’s\nmemories)—I asked Miss Pole what was the very last thing they had ever\nheard about him; and then she named the absurd report to which I have\nalluded, about his having been elected Great Lama of Thibet; and this\nwas a signal for each lady to go off on her separate idea.  Mrs\nForrester’s start was made on the veiled prophet in Lalla Rookh—whether\nI thought he was meant for the Great Lama, though Peter was not so ugly,\nindeed rather handsome, if he had not been freckled.  I was thankful to\nsee her double upon Peter; but, in a moment, the delusive lady was off\nupon Rowland’s Kalydor, and the merits of cosmetics and hair oils in\ngeneral, and holding forth so fluently that I turned to listen to Miss\nPole, who (through the llamas, the beasts of burden) had got to Peruvian\nbonds, and the share market, and her poor opinion of joint-stock banks\nin general, and of that one in particular in which Miss Matty’s money\nwas invested.  In vain I put in “When was it—in what year was it that\nyou heard that Mr Peter was the Great Lama?”  They only joined issue to\ndispute whether llamas were carnivorous animals or not; in which dispute\nthey were not quite on fair grounds, as Mrs Forrester (after they had\ngrown warm and cool again) acknowledged that she always confused\ncarnivorous and graminivorous together, just as she did horizontal and\nperpendicular; but then she apologised for it very prettily, by saying\nthat in her day the only use people made of four-syllabled words was to\nteach how they should be spelt."

So we threw our gentility with double force into our\nmanners, and very genteel we were for two minutes while Miss Pole\nrecovered breath, and excited our curiosity strongly by lifting up her\nhands in amazement, and bringing them down in silence, as if what she\nhad to say was too big for words, and could only be expressed by\npantomime.“What do you think, Miss Matty?  What _do_ you think?  Lady Glenmire is\nto marry—is to be married, I mean—Lady Glenmire—Mr Hoggins—Mr Hoggins is\ngoing to marry Lady Glenmire!”“Marry!” said we.  “Marry!  Madness!”[Picture: What do you think, Miss Matty]“Marry!” said Miss Pole, with the decision that belonged to her\ncharacter.  “_I_ said marry! as you do; and I also said, ‘What a fool my\nlady is going to make of herself!’  I could have said ‘Madness!’ but I\ncontrolled myself, for it was in a public shop that I heard of it.\nWhere feminine delicacy is gone to, I don’t know!  You and I, Miss\nMatty, would have been ashamed to have known that our marriage was\nspoken of in a grocer’s shop, in the hearing of shopmen!”“But,” said Miss Matty, sighing as one recovering from a blow, “perhaps\nit is not true.  Perhaps we are doing her injustice.”“No,” said Miss Pole.  “I have taken care to ascertain that.  I went\nstraight to Mrs Fitz-Adam, to borrow a cookery-book which I knew she\nhad; and I introduced my congratulations _à propos_ of the difficulty\ngentlemen must have in house-keeping; and Mrs Fitz-Adam bridled up, and\nsaid that she believed it was true, though how and where I could have\nheard it she did not know.  She said her brother and Lady Glenmire had\ncome to an understanding at last.  ‘Understanding!’ such a coarse word!\nBut my lady will have to come down to many a want of refinement.  I have\nreason to believe Mr Hoggins sups on bread-and-cheese and beer every\nnight.“Marry!” said Miss Matty once again.  “Well!  I never thought of it.\nTwo people that we know going to be married.  It’s coming very near!”“So near that my heart stopped beating when I heard of it, while you\nmight have counted twelve,” said Miss Pole.“One does not know whose turn may come next.  Here, in Cranford, poor\nLady Glenmire might have thought herself safe,” said Miss Matty, with a\ngentle pity in her tones."

I am not\nsurprised that Mr Hoggins has liked her.”“Oh!  I don’t know.  Mr Hoggins is rich, and very pleasant-looking,”\nsaid Miss Matty, “and very good-tempered and kind-hearted.”"

  "content": "“She has married for an establishment, that’s it.  I suppose she takes\nthe surgery with it,” said Miss Pole, with a little dry laugh at her own\njoke.  But, like many people who think they have made a severe and\nsarcastic speech, which yet is clever of its kind, she began to relax in\nher grimness from the moment when she made this allusion to the surgery;\nand we turned to speculate on the way in which Mrs Jamieson would\nreceive the news.  The person whom she had left in charge of her house\nto keep off followers from her maids to set up a follower of her own!\nAnd that follower a man whom Mrs Jamieson had tabooed as vulgar, and\ninadmissible to Cranford society, not merely on account of his name, but\nbecause of his voice, his complexion, his boots, smelling of the stable,\nand himself, smelling of drugs.  Had he ever been to see Lady Glenmire\nat Mrs Jamieson’s?  Chloride of lime would not purify the house in its\nowner’s estimation if he had.  Or had their interviews been confined to\nthe occasional meetings in the chamber of the poor sick conjuror, to\nwhom, with all our sense of the _mésalliance_, we could not help\nallowing that they had both been exceedingly kind?  And now it turned\nout that a servant of Mrs Jamieson’s had been ill, and Mr Hoggins had\nbeen attending her for some weeks.  So the wolf had got into the fold,\nand now he was carrying off the shepherdess.  What would Mrs Jamieson\nsay?  We looked into the darkness of futurity as a child gazes after a\nrocket up in the cloudy sky, full of wondering expectation of the\nrattle, the discharge, and the brilliant shower of sparks and light.\nThen we brought ourselves down to earth and the present time by\nquestioning each other (being all equally ignorant, and all equally\nwithout the slightest data to build any conclusions upon) as to when IT\nwould take place?  Where?  How much a year Mr Hoggins had?  Whether she\nwould drop her title?  And how Martha and the other correct servants in\nCranford would ever be brought to announce a married couple as Lady\nGlenmire and Mr Hoggins?  But would they be visited?  Would Mrs Jamieson\nlet us?  Or must we choose between the Honourable Mrs Jamieson and the\ndegraded Lady Glenmire?  We all liked Lady Glenmire the best.  She was\nbright, and kind, and sociable, and agreeable; and Mrs Jamieson was\ndull, and inert, and pompous, and tiresome.  But we had acknowledged the\nsway of the latter so long, that it seemed like a kind of disloyalty now\neven to meditate disobedience to the prohibition we anticipated."

I shall never forget the\nimploring expression of her eyes, as she looked at us over her\npocket-handkerchief.  They said, as plain as words could speak, “Don’t\nlet Nature deprive me of the treasure which is mine, although for a time\nI can make no use of it.”  And we did not.Mrs Forrester’s surprise was equal to ours; and her sense of injury\nrather greater, because she had to feel for her Order, and saw more\nfully than we could do how such conduct brought stains on the\naristocracy.When she and Miss Pole left us we endeavoured to subside into calmness;\nbut Miss Matty was really upset by the intelligence she had heard.  She\nreckoned it up, and it was more than fifteen years since she had heard\nof any of her acquaintance going to be married, with the one exception\nof Miss Jessie Brown; and, as she said, it gave her quite a shock, and\nmade her feel as if she could not think what would happen next."

  "content": "I don’t know whether it is a fancy of mine, or a real fact, but I have\nnoticed that, just after the announcement of an engagement in any set,\nthe unmarried ladies in that set flutter out in an unusual gaiety and\nnewness of dress, as much as to say, in a tacit and unconscious manner,\n“We also are spinsters.”  Miss Matty and Miss Pole talked and thought\nmore about bonnets, gowns, caps, and shawls, during the fortnight that\nsucceeded this call, than I had known them do for years before.  But it\nmight be the spring weather, for it was a warm and pleasant March; and\nmerinoes and beavers, and woollen materials of all sorts were but\nungracious receptacles of the bright sun’s glancing rays.  It had not\nbeen Lady Glenmire’s dress that had won Mr Hoggins’s heart, for she went\nabout on her errands of kindness more shabby than ever.  Although in the\nhurried glimpses I caught of her at church or elsewhere she appeared\nrather to shun meeting any of her friends, her face seemed to have\nalmost something of the flush of youth in it; her lips looked redder and\nmore trembling full than in their old compressed state, and her eyes\ndwelt on all things with a lingering light, as if she was learning to\nlove Cranford and its belongings.  Mr Hoggins looked broad and radiant,\nand creaked up the middle aisle at church in a brand-new pair of\ntop-boots—an audible, as well as visible, sign of his purposed change of\nstate; for the tradition went, that the boots he had worn till now were\nthe identical pair in which he first set out on his rounds in Cranford\ntwenty-five years ago; only they had been new-pieced, high and low, top\nand bottom, heel and sole, black leather and brown leather, more times\nthan any one could tell.None of the ladies in Cranford chose to sanction the marriage by\ncongratulating either of the parties.  We wished to ignore the whole\naffair until our liege lady, Mrs Jamieson, returned.  Till she came back\nto give us our cue, we felt that it would be better to consider the\nengagement in the same light as the Queen of Spain’s legs—facts which\ncertainly existed, but the less said about the better.  This restraint\nupon our tongues—for you see if we did not speak about it to any of the\nparties concerned, how could we get answers to the questions that we\nlonged to ask?—was beginning to be irksome, and our idea of the dignity\nof silence was paling before our curiosity, when another direction was\ngiven to our thoughts, by an announcement on the part of the principal\nshopkeeper of Cranford, who ranged the trades from grocer and\ncheesemonger to man-milliner, as occasion required, that the spring\nfashions were arrived, and would be exhibited on the following Tuesday\nat his rooms in High Street.  Now Miss Matty had been only waiting for\nthis before buying herself a new silk gown.  I had offered, it is true,\nto send to Drumble for patterns, but she had rejected my proposal,\ngently implying that she had not forgotten her disappointment about the\nsea-green turban.  I was thankful that I was on the spot now, to\ncounteract the dazzling fascination of any yellow or scarlet silk."

  "content": "THE very Tuesday morning on which Mr Johnson was going to show the\nfashions, the post-woman brought two letters to the house.  I say the\npost-woman, but I should say the postman’s wife.  He was a lame\nshoemaker, a very clean, honest man, much respected in the town; but he\nnever brought the letters round except on unusual occasions, such as\nChristmas Day or Good Friday; and on those days the letters, which\nshould have been delivered at eight in the morning, did not make their\nappearance until two or three in the afternoon, for every one liked poor\nThomas, and gave him a welcome on these festive occasions.  He used to\nsay, “He was welly stawed wi’ eating, for there were three or four\nhouses where nowt would serve ’em but he must share in their breakfast;”\nand by the time he had done his last breakfast, he came to some other\nfriend who was beginning dinner; but come what might in the way of\ntemptation, Tom was always sober, civil, and smiling; and, as Miss\nJenkyns used to say, it was a lesson in patience, that she doubted not\nwould call out that precious quality in some minds, where, but for\nThomas, it might have lain dormant and undiscovered.  Patience was\ncertainly very dormant in Miss Jenkyns’s mind.  She was always expecting\nletters, and always drumming on the table till the post-woman had called\nor gone past.  On Christmas Day and Good Friday she drummed from\nbreakfast till church, from church-time till two o’clock—unless when the\nfire wanted stirring, when she invariably knocked down the fire-irons,\nand scolded Miss Matty for it. But equally certain was the hearty\nwelcome and the good dinner for Thomas; Miss Jenkyns standing over him\nlike a bold dragoon, questioning him as to his children—what they were\ndoing—what school they went to; upbraiding him if another was likely to\nmake its appearance, but sending even the little babies the shilling and\nthe mince-pie which was her gift to all the children, with half-a-crown\nin addition for both father and mother.  The post was not half of so\nmuch consequence to dear Miss Matty; but not for the world would she\nhave diminished Thomas’s welcome and his dole, though I could see that\nshe felt rather shy over the ceremony, which had been regarded by Miss\nJenkyns as a glorious opportunity for giving advice and benefiting her\nfellow-creatures.  Miss Matty would steal the money all in a lump into\nhis hand, as if she were ashamed of herself.  Miss Jenkyns gave him each\nindividual coin separate, with a “There! that’s for yourself; that’s for\nJenny,” etc.  Miss Matty would even beckon Martha out of the kitchen\nwhile he ate his food: and once, to my knowledge, winked at its rapid\ndisappearance into a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief.  Miss Jenkyns\nalmost scolded him if he did not leave a clean plate, however heaped it\nmight have been, and gave an injunction with every mouthful."

Miss\nMatty’s was printed.  My father’s was just a man’s letter; I mean it was\nvery dull, and gave no information beyond that he was well, that they\nhad had a good deal of rain, that trade was very stagnant, and there\nwere many disagreeable rumours afloat.  He then asked me if I knew\nwhether Miss Matty still retained her shares in the Town and County\nBank, as there were very unpleasant reports about it; though nothing\nmore than he had always foreseen, and had prophesied to Miss Jenkyns\nyears ago, when she would invest their little property in it—the only\nunwise step that clever woman had ever taken, to his knowledge (the only\ntime she ever acted against his advice, I knew).  However, if anything\nhad gone wrong, of course I was not to think of leaving Miss Matty while\nI could be of any use, etc.“Who is your letter from, my dear?  Mine is a very civil invitation,\nsigned ‘Edwin Wilson,’ asking me to attend an important meeting of the\nshareholders of the Town and County Bank, to be held in Drumble, on\nThursday the twenty-first.  I am sure, it is very attentive of them to\nremember me.”I did not like to hear of this “important meeting,” for, though I did\nnot know much about business, I feared it confirmed what my father said:\nhowever, I thought, ill news always came fast enough, so I resolved to\nsay nothing about my alarm, and merely told her that my father was well,\nand sent his kind regards to her.

I am afraid\nI could not help them much; indeed, if they came to accounts, I should\nbe quite in the way, for I never could do sums in my head.  Deborah, I\nknow, rather wished to go, and went so far as to order a new bonnet for\nthe occasion: but when the time came she had a bad cold; so they sent\nher a very polite account of what they had done.  Chosen a director, I\nthink it was.  Do you think they want me to help them to choose a\ndirector?  I am sure I should choose your father at once!”“My father has no shares in the bank,” said I.“Oh, no!  I remember.  He objected very much to Deborah’s buying any, I\nbelieve.  But she was quite the woman of business, and always judged for\nherself; and here, you see, they have paid eight per cent. all these\nyears.”It was a very uncomfortable subject to me, with my half-knowledge; so I\nthought I would change the conversation, and I asked at what time she\nthought we had better go and see the fashions.  “Well, my dear,” she\nsaid, “the thing is this: it is not etiquette to go till after twelve;\nbut then, you see, all Cranford will be there, and one does not like to\nbe too curious about dress and trimmings and caps with all the world\nlooking on.  It is never genteel to be over-curious on these occasions.\nDeborah had the knack of always looking as if the latest fashion was\nnothing new to her; a manner she had caught from Lady Arley, who did see\nall the new modes in London, you know.  So I thought we would just slip\ndown—for I do want this morning, soon after breakfast half-a-pound of\ntea—and then we could go up and examine the things at our leisure, and\nsee exactly how my new silk gown must be made; and then, after twelve,\nwe could go with our minds disengaged, and free from thoughts of dress.”"

I discovered that it\nwould be really the first time in her life that she had had to choose\nanything of consequence for herself: for Miss Jenkyns had always been\nthe more decided character, whatever her taste might have been; and it\nis astonishing how such people carry the world before them by the mere\nforce of will.  Miss Matty anticipated the sight of the glossy folds\nwith as much delight as if the five sovereigns, set apart for the\npurchase, could buy all the silks in the shop; and (remembering my own\nloss of two hours in a toyshop before I could tell on what wonder to\nspend a silver threepence) I was very glad that we were going early,\nthat dear Miss Matty might have leisure for the delights of perplexity.If a happy sea-green could be met with, the gown was to be sea-green: if\nnot, she inclined to maize, and I to silver gray; and we discussed the\nrequisite number of breadths until we arrived at the shop-door.  We were\nto buy the tea, select the silk, and then clamber up the iron corkscrew\nstairs that led into what was once a loft, though now a fashion\nshow-room."
