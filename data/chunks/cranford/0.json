  "content": "﻿CHAPTER I.\nOUR SOCIETYIN the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the\nholders of houses above a certain rent are women.  If a married couple\ncome to settle in the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is\neither fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the Cranford\nevening parties, or he is accounted for by being with his regiment, his\nship, or closely engaged in business all the week in the great\nneighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant only twenty miles on a\nrailroad.  In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen, they are\nnot at Cranford.  What could they do if they were there?  The surgeon\nhas his round of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man\ncannot be a surgeon.  For keeping the trim gardens full of choice\nflowers without a weed to speck them; for frightening away little boys\nwho look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings; for rushing\nout at the geese that occasionally venture in to the gardens if the\ngates are left open; for deciding all questions of literature and\npolitics without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or\narguments; for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybody’s\naffairs in the parish; for keeping their neat maid-servants in admirable\norder; for kindness (somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender\ngood offices to each other whenever they are in distress, the ladies of\nCranford are quite sufficient.  “A man,” as one of them observed to me\nonce, “is _so_ in the way in the house!”  Although the ladies of\nCranford know all each other’s proceedings, they are exceedingly\nindifferent to each other’s opinions. Indeed, as each has her own\nindividuality, not to say eccentricity, pretty strongly developed,\nnothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but, somehow, good-will\nreigns among them to a considerable degree."

  "content": "The Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel, spirited out\nin a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head; just enough to\nprevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat.  Their\ndress is very independent of fashion; as they observe, “What does it\nsignify how we dress here at Cranford, where everybody knows us?”  And\nif they go from home, their reason is equally cogent, “What does it\nsignify how we dress here, where nobody knows us?”  The materials of\ntheir clothes are, in general, good and plain, and most of them are\nnearly as scrupulous as Miss Tyler, of cleanly memory; but I will\nanswer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in\nwear in England, was seen in Cranford—and seen without a smile.[Picture: A magnificent family red silk umbrella]I can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a\ngentle little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters, used to\npatter to church on rainy days.  Have you any red silk umbrellas in\nLondon?  We had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in\nCranford; and the little boys mobbed it, and called it “a stick in\npetticoats.”  It might have been the very red silk one I have described,\nheld by a strong father over a troop of little ones; the poor little\nlady—the survivor of all—could scarcely carry it.Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls; and they\nwere announced to any young people who might be staying in the town,\nwith all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws were read once a\nyear on the Tinwald Mount.“Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey\nto-night, my dear” (fifteen miles in a gentleman’s carriage); “they will\ngive you some rest to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they\nwill call; so be at liberty after twelve—from twelve to three are our\ncalling hours.”Then, after they had called—“It is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told you, my dear, never\nto let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and\nreturning it; and also, that you are never to stay longer than a quarter\nof an hour.”“But am I to look at my watch?  How am I to find out when a quarter of\nan hour has passed?”“You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow yourself\nto forget it in conversation.”As everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or paid\na call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about.  We kept\nourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our\ntime."

  "content": "I imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor, and had\nsome difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were like the\nSpartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling face.  We none of us\nspoke of money, because that subject savoured of commerce and trade, and\nthough some might be poor, we were all aristocratic.  The Cranfordians\nhad that kindly _esprit de corps_ which made them overlook all\ndeficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their\npoverty.  When Mrs Forrester, for instance, gave a party in her\nbaby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on\nthe sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray out from\nunderneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural\nthing in the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies\nas if we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants’ hall,\nsecond table, with housekeeper and steward, instead of the one little\ncharity-school maiden, whose short ruddy arms could never have been\nstrong enough to carry the tray upstairs, if she had not been assisted\nin private by her mistress, who now sat in state, pretending not to know\nwhat cakes were sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that\nwe knew, and we knew that she knew that we knew, she had been busy all\nthe morning making tea-bread and sponge-cakes.There were one or two consequences arising from this general but\nunacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility, which\nwere not amiss, and which might be introduced into many circles of\nsociety to their great improvement.  For instance, the inhabitants of\nCranford kept early hours, and clattered home in their pattens, under\nthe guidance of a lantern-bearer, about nine o’clock at night; and the\nwhole town was abed and asleep by half-past ten.  Moreover, it was\nconsidered “vulgar” (a tremendous word in Cranford) to give anything\nexpensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening\nentertainments.  Wafer bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all\nthat the Honourable Mrs Jamieson gave; and she was sister-in-law to the\nlate Earl of Glenmire, although she did practise such “elegant economy.”"

  "content": "“Elegant economy!”  How naturally one falls back into the phraseology of\nCranford!  There, economy was always “elegant,” and money-spending\nalways “vulgar and ostentatious”; a sort of sour-grapeism which made us\nvery peaceful and satisfied.  I never shall forget the dismay felt when\na certain Captain Brown came to live at Cranford, and openly spoke about\nhis being poor—not in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and\nwindows being previously closed, but in the public street! in a loud\nmilitary voice! alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a\nparticular house.  The ladies of Cranford were already rather moaning\nover the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman.  He was\na half-pay captain, and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring\nrailroad, which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little\ntown; and if, in addition to his masculine gender, and his connection\nwith the obnoxious railroad, he was so brazen as to talk of being\npoor—why, then, indeed, he must be sent to Coventry.  Death was as true\nand as common as poverty; yet people never spoke about that, loud out in\nthe streets.  It was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite.  We had\ntacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of\nvisiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything\nthat they wished.  If we walked to or from a party, it was because the\nnight was _so_ fine, or the air _so_ refreshing, not because\nsedan-chairs were expensive.  If we wore prints, instead of summer\nsilks, it was because we preferred a washing material; and so on, till\nwe blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were, all of us, people\nof very moderate means.  Of course, then, we did not know what to make\nof a man who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace.  Yet,\nsomehow, Captain Brown made himself respected in Cranford, and was\ncalled upon, in spite of all resolutions to the contrary.  I was\nsurprised to hear his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which I\npaid to Cranford about a year after he had settled in the town.  My own\nfriends had been among the bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit\nthe Captain and his daughters, only twelve months before; and now he was\neven admitted in the tabooed hours before twelve.  True, it was to\ndiscover the cause of a smoking chimney, before the fire was lighted;\nbut still Captain Brown walked upstairs, nothing daunted, spoke in a\nvoice too large for the room, and joked quite in the way of a tame man\nabout the house.  He had been blind to all the small slights, and\nomissions of trivial ceremonies, with which he had been received.  He\nhad been friendly, though the Cranford ladies had been cool; he had\nanswered small sarcastic compliments in good faith; and with his manly\nfrankness had overpowered all the shrinking which met him as a man who\nwas not ashamed to be poor. And, at last, his excellent masculine common\nsense, and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic\ndilemmas, had gained him an extraordinary place as authority among the\nCranford ladies.  He himself went on in his course, as unaware of his\npopularity as he had been of the reverse; and I am sure he was startled\none day when he found his advice so highly esteemed as to make some\ncounsel which he had given in jest to be taken in sober, serious\nearnest."

You could not pay the short quarter of an\nhour call without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful\nintelligence of this animal.  The whole town knew and kindly regarded\nMiss Betsy Barker’s Alderney; therefore great was the sympathy and\nregret when, in an unguarded moment, the poor cow tumbled into a\nlime-pit.  She moaned so loudly that she was soon heard and rescued; but\nmeanwhile the poor beast had lost most of her hair, and came out looking\nnaked, cold, and miserable, in a bare skin.  Everybody pitied the\nanimal, though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll\nappearance.  Miss Betsy Barker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay;\nand it was said she thought of trying a bath of oil.  This remedy,\nperhaps, was recommended by some one of the number whose advice she\nasked; but the proposal, if ever it was made, was knocked on the head by\nCaptain Brown’s decided “Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel\ndrawers, ma’am, if you wish to keep her alive.  But my advice is, kill\nthe poor creature at once.”Miss Betsy Barker dried her eyes, and thanked the Captain heartily; she\nset to work, and by-and-by all the town turned out to see the Alderney\nmeekly going to her pasture, clad in dark grey flannel.  I have watched\nher myself many a time.  Do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in\nLondon?[Picture: Meekly going to her pasture]"

  "content": "Captain Brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town,\nwhere he lived with his two daughters.  He must have been upwards of\nsixty at the time of the first visit I paid to Cranford after I had left\nit as a residence.  But he had a wiry, well-trained, elastic figure, a\nstiff military throw-back of his head, and a springing step, which made\nhim appear much younger than he was.  His eldest daughter looked almost\nas old as himself, and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his\napparent age.  Miss Brown must have been forty; she had a sickly,\npained, careworn expression on her face, and looked as if the gaiety of\nyouth had long faded out of sight.  Even when young she must have been\nplain and hard-featured.  Miss Jessie Brown was ten years younger than\nher sister, and twenty shades prettier.  Her face was round and dimpled.\n Miss Jenkyns once said, in a passion against Captain Brown (the cause\nof which I will tell you presently), “that she thought it was time for\nMiss Jessie to leave off her dimples, and not always to be trying to\nlook like a child.”  It was true there was something childlike in her\nface; and there will be, I think, till she dies, though she should live\nto a hundred. Her eyes were large blue wondering eyes, looking straight\nat you; her nose was unformed and snub, and her lips were red and dewy;\nshe wore her hair, too, in little rows of curls, which heightened this\nappearance.  I do not know whether she was pretty or not; but I liked\nher face, and so did everybody, and I do not think she could help her\ndimples.  She had something of her father’s jauntiness of gait and\nmanner; and any female observer might detect a slight difference in the\nattire of the two sisters—that of Miss Jessie being about two pounds per\nannum more expensive than Miss Brown’s.  Two pounds was a large sum in\nCaptain Brown’s annual disbursements.Such was the impression made upon me by the Brown family when I first\nsaw them all together in Cranford Church.  The Captain I had met\nbefore—on the occasion of the smoky chimney, which he had cured by some\nsimple alteration in the flue.  In church, he held his double eye-glass\nto his eyes during the Morning Hymn, and then lifted up his head erect\nand sang out loud and joyfully.  He made the responses louder than the\nclerk—an old man with a piping feeble voice, who, I think, felt\naggrieved at the Captain’s sonorous bass, and quivered higher and higher\nin consequence.On coming out of church, the brisk Captain paid the most gallant\nattention to his two daughters.  He nodded and smiled to his\nacquaintances; but he shook hands with none until he had helped Miss\nBrown to unfurl her umbrella, had relieved her of her prayer-book, and\nhad waited patiently till she, with trembling nervous hands, had taken\nup her gown to walk through the wet roads."

  "content": "I wonder what the Cranford ladies did with Captain Brown at their\nparties.  We had often rejoiced, in former days, that there was no\ngentleman to be attended to, and to find conversation for, at the\ncard-parties.  We had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the\nevenings; and, in our love for gentility, and distaste of mankind, we\nhad almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be “vulgar”; so\nthat when I found my friend and hostess, Miss Jenkyns, was going to have\na party in my honour, and that Captain and the Miss Browns were invited,\nI wondered much what would be the course of the evening.  Card-tables,\nwith green baize tops, were set out by daylight, just as usual; it was\nthe third week in November, so the evenings closed in about four.\nCandles, and clean packs of cards, were arranged on each table.  The\nfire was made up; the neat maid-servant had received her last\ndirections; and there we stood, dressed in our best, each with a\ncandle-lighter in our hands, ready to dart at the candles as soon as the\nfirst knock came.  Parties in Cranford were solemn festivities, making\nthe ladies feel gravely elated as they sat together in their best\ndresses.  As soon as three had arrived, we sat down to “Preference,” I\nbeing the unlucky fourth.  The next four comers were put down\nimmediately to another table; and presently the tea-trays, which I had\nseen set out in the store-room as I passed in the morning, were placed\neach on the middle of a card-table. The china was delicate egg-shell;\nthe old-fashioned silver glittered with polishing; but the eatables were\nof the slightest description.  While the trays were yet on the tables,\nCaptain and the Miss Browns came in; and I could see that, somehow or\nother, the Captain was a favourite with all the ladies present.  Ruffled\nbrows were smoothed, sharp voices lowered at his approach.  Miss Brown\nlooked ill, and depressed almost to gloom. Miss Jessie smiled as usual,\nand seemed nearly as popular as her father. He immediately and quietly\nassumed the man’s place in the room; attended to every one’s wants,\nlessened the pretty maid-servant’s labour by waiting on empty cups and\nbread-and-butterless ladies; and yet did it all in so easy and dignified\na manner, and so much as if it were a matter of course for the strong to\nattend to the weak, that he was a true man throughout.  He played for\nthreepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been pounds;\nand yet, in all his attention to strangers, he had an eye on his\nsuffering daughter—for suffering I was sure she was, though to many eyes\nshe might only appear to be irritable.  Miss Jessie could not play\ncards: but she talked to the sitters-out, who, before her coming, had\nbeen rather inclined to be cross.  She sang, too, to an old cracked\npiano, which I think had been a spinet in its youth.  Miss Jessie sang,\n“Jock of Hazeldean” a little out of tune; but we were none of us\nmusical, though Miss Jenkyns beat time, out of time, by way of appearing\nto be so."

  "content": "It was very good of Miss Jenkyns to do this; for I had seen that, a\nlittle before, she had been a good deal annoyed by Miss Jessie Brown’s\nunguarded admission (_à propos_ of Shetland wool) that she had an uncle,\nher mother’s brother, who was a shopkeeper in Edinburgh.  Miss Jenkyns\ntried to drown this confession by a terrible cough—for the Honourable\nMrs Jamieson was sitting at a card-table nearest Miss Jessie, and what\nwould she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a\nshop-keeper’s niece!  But Miss Jessie Brown (who had no tact, as we all\nagreed the next morning) _would_ repeat the information, and assure Miss\nPole she could easily get her the identical Shetland wool required,\n“through my uncle, who has the best assortment of Shetland goods of any\none in Edinbro’.”  It was to take the taste of this out of our mouths,\nand the sound of this out of our ears, that Miss Jenkyns proposed music;\nso I say again, it was very good of her to beat time to the song.When the trays re-appeared with biscuits and wine, punctually at a\nquarter to nine, there was conversation, comparing of cards, and talking\nover tricks; but by-and-by Captain Brown sported a bit of literature.“Have you seen any numbers of ‘The Pickwick Papers’?” said he.  (They\nwere then publishing in parts.)  “Capital thing!”Now Miss Jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of Cranford; and, on\nthe strength of a number of manuscript sermons, and a pretty good\nlibrary of divinity, considered herself literary, and looked upon any\nconversation about books as a challenge to her.  So she answered and\nsaid, “Yes, she had seen them; indeed, she might say she had read them.”“And what do you think of them?” exclaimed Captain Brown.  “Aren’t they\nfamously good?”So urged Miss Jenkyns could not but speak."

Some\nof us laughed heartily.  _I_ did not dare, because I was staying in the\nhouse.  Miss Jenkyns sat in patient gravity.  When it was ended, she\nturned to me, and said with mild dignity—“Fetch me ‘Rasselas,’ my dear, out of the book-room.”When I had brought it to her, she turned to Captain Brown—“Now allow _me_ to read you a scene, and then the present company can\njudge between your favourite, Mr Boz, and Dr Johnson.”She read one of the conversations between Rasselas and Imlac, in a\nhigh-pitched, majestic voice: and when she had ended, she said, “I\nimagine I am now justified in my preference of Dr Johnson as a writer of\nfiction.”  The Captain screwed his lips up, and drummed on the table,\nbut he did not speak.  She thought she would give him a finishing blow\nor two.[Picture: Endeavouring to beguile her into conversation]“I consider it vulgar, and below the dignity of literature, to publish\nin numbers.”“How was the _Rambler_ published, ma’am?” asked Captain Brown in a low\nvoice, which I think Miss Jenkyns could not have heard.“Dr Johnson’s style is a model for young beginners.  My father\nrecommended it to me when I began to write letters—I have formed my own\nstyle upon it; I recommended it to your favourite.”“I should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for any such\npompous writing,” said Captain Brown."

  "content": "IT was impossible to live a month at Cranford and not know the daily\nhabits of each resident; and long before my visit was ended I knew much\nconcerning the whole Brown trio.  There was nothing new to be discovered\nrespecting their poverty; for they had spoken simply and openly about\nthat from the very first.  They made no mystery of the necessity for\ntheir being economical.  All that remained to be discovered was the\nCaptain’s infinite kindness of heart, and the various modes in which,\nunconsciously to himself, he manifested it.  Some little anecdotes were\ntalked about for some time after they occurred.  As we did not read\nmuch, and as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants, there\nwas a dearth of subjects for conversation.  We therefore discussed the\ncircumstance of the Captain taking a poor old woman’s dinner out of her\nhands one very slippery Sunday.  He had met her returning from the\nbakehouse as he came from church, and noticed her precarious footing;\nand, with the grave dignity with which he did everything, he relieved\nher of her burden, and steered along the street by her side, carrying\nher baked mutton and potatoes safely home.  This was thought very\neccentric; and it was rather expected that he would pay a round of\ncalls, on the Monday morning, to explain and apologise to the Cranford\nsense of propriety: but he did no such thing: and then it was decided\nthat he was ashamed, and was keeping out of sight.  In a kindly pity for\nhim, we began to say, “After all, the Sunday morning’s occurrence showed\ngreat goodness of heart,” and it was resolved that he should be\ncomforted on his next appearance amongst us; but, lo! he came down upon\nus, untouched by any sense of shame, speaking loud and bass as ever, his\nhead thrown back, his wig as jaunty and well-curled as usual, and we\nwere obliged to conclude he had forgotten all about Sunday.Miss Pole and Miss Jessie Brown had set up a kind of intimacy on the\nstrength of the Shetland wool and the new knitting stitches; so it\nhappened that when I went to visit Miss Pole I saw more of the Browns\nthan I had done while staying with Miss Jenkyns, who had never got over\nwhat she called Captain Brown’s disparaging remarks upon Dr Johnson as a\nwriter of light and agreeable fiction.  I found that Miss Brown was\nseriously ill of some lingering, incurable complaint, the pain\noccasioned by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that I had\ntaken for unmitigated crossness.  Cross, too, she was at times, when the\nnervous irritability occasioned by her disease became past endurance.\nMiss Jessie bore with her at these times, even more patiently than she\ndid with the bitter self-upbraidings by which they were invariably\nsucceeded. Miss Brown used to accuse herself, not merely of hasty and\nirritable temper, but also of being the cause why her father and sister\nwere obliged to pinch, in order to allow her the small luxuries which\nwere necessaries in her condition.  She would so fain have made\nsacrifices for them, and have lightened their cares, that the original\ngenerosity of her disposition added acerbity to her temper.  All this\nwas borne by Miss Jessie and her father with more than placidity—with\nabsolute tenderness. I forgave Miss Jessie her singing out of tune, and\nher juvenility of dress, when I saw her at home.  I came to perceive\nthat Captain Brown’s dark Brutus wig and padded coat (alas! too often\nthreadbare) were remnants of the military smartness of his youth, which\nhe now wore unconsciously.  He was a man of infinite resources, gained\nin his barrack experience.  As he confessed, no one could black his\nboots to please him except himself; but, indeed, he was not above saving\nthe little maid-servant’s labours in every way—knowing, most likely,\nthat his daughter’s illness made the place a hard one."

She received the present with cool gratitude, and thanked\nhim formally.  When he was gone, she bade me put it away in the\nlumber-room; feeling, probably, that no present from a man who preferred\nMr Boz to Dr Johnson could be less jarring than an iron fire-shovel.Such was the state of things when I left Cranford and went to Drumble.\nI had, however, several correspondents, who kept me _au fait_ as to the\nproceedings of the dear little town.  There was Miss Pole, who was\nbecoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting,\nand the burden of whose letter was something like, “But don’t you forget\nthe white worsted at Flint’s” of the old song; for at the end of every\nsentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission\nwhich I was to execute for her.  Miss Matilda Jenkyns (who did not mind\nbeing called Miss Matty, when Miss Jenkyns was not by) wrote nice, kind,\nrambling letters, now and then venturing into an opinion of her own; but\nsuddenly pulling herself up, and either begging me not to name what she\nhad said, as Deborah thought differently, and _she_ knew, or else\nputting in a postscript to the effect that, since writing the above, she\nhad been talking over the subject with Deborah, and was quite convinced\nthat, etc.—(here probably followed a recantation of every opinion she\nhad given in the letter).

I secretly think she took the Hebrew\nprophetess for a model in character; and, indeed, she was not unlike the\nstern prophetess in some ways, making allowance, of course, for modern\ncustoms and difference in dress.  Miss Jenkyns wore a cravat, and a\nlittle bonnet like a jockey-cap, and altogether had the appearance of a\nstrong-minded woman; although she would have despised the modern idea of\nwomen being equal to men.  Equal, indeed! she knew they were superior.\nBut to return to her letters.  Everything in them was stately and grand\nlike herself. I have been looking them over (dear Miss Jenkyns, how I\nhonoured her!) and I will give an extract, more especially because it\nrelates to our friend Captain Brown:—"

You will not easily conjecture what brought his\nlordship within the precincts of our little town.  It was to see Captain\nBrown, with whom, it appears, his lordship was acquainted in the ‘plumed\nwars,’ and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his\nlordship’s head when some great peril was impending over it, off the\nmisnomered Cape of Good Hope.  You know our friend the Honourable Mrs\nJamieson’s deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity, and you will\ntherefore not be so much surprised when I tell you she was quite unable\nto disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question.  I was\nanxious, I confess, to ascertain in what manner Captain Brown, with his\nlimited establishment, could receive so distinguished a guest; and I\ndiscovered that his lordship retired to rest, and, let us hope, to\nrefreshing slumbers, at the Angel Hotel; but shared the Brunonian meals\nduring the two days that he honoured Cranford with his august presence.\nMrs Johnson, our civil butcher’s wife, informs me that Miss Jessie\npurchased a leg of lamb; but, besides this, I can hear of no preparation\nwhatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor.\nPerhaps they entertained him with ‘the feast of reason and the flow of\nsoul’; and to us, who are acquainted with Captain Brown’s sad want of\nrelish for ‘the pure wells of English undefiled,’ it may be matter for\ncongratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by\nholding converse with an elegant and refined member of the British\naristocracy. But from some mundane failings who is altogether free?”Miss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to me by the same post.  Such a piece of\nnews as Lord Mauleverer’s visit was not to be lost on the Cranford\nletter-writers: they made the most of it.  Miss Matty humbly apologised\nfor writing at the same time as her sister, who was so much more capable\nthan she to describe the honour done to Cranford; but in spite of a\nlittle bad spelling, Miss Matty’s account gave me the best idea of the\ncommotion occasioned by his lordship’s visit, after it had occurred;\nfor, except the people at the Angel, the Browns, Mrs Jamieson, and a\nlittle lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against\nthe aristocratic legs, I could not hear of any one with whom his\nlordship had held conversation.My next visit to Cranford was in the summer.  There had been neither\nbirths, deaths, nor marriages since I was there last.  Everybody lived\nin the same house, and wore pretty nearly the same well-preserved,\nold-fashioned clothes.  The greatest event was, that Miss Jenkyns had\npurchased a new carpet for the drawing-room.  Oh, the busy work Miss\nMatty and I had in chasing the sunbeams, as they fell in an afternoon\nright down on this carpet through the blindless window!  We spread\nnewspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work; and,\nlo! in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved, and was blazing away on a\nfresh spot; and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of\nthe newspapers.  We were very busy, too, one whole morning, before Miss\nJenkyns gave her party, in following her directions, and in cutting out\nand stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to\nevery chair set for the expected visitors, lest their shoes might dirty\nor defile the purity of the carpet.  Do you make paper paths for every\nguest to walk upon in London?"

  "content": "Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns were not very cordial to each other.  The\nliterary dispute, of which I had seen the beginning, was a “raw,” the\nslightest touch on which made them wince.  It was the only difference of\nopinion they had ever had; but that difference was enough.  Miss Jenkyns\ncould not refrain from talking at Captain Brown; and, though he did not\nreply, he drummed with his fingers, which action she felt and resented\nas very disparaging to Dr Johnson.  He was rather ostentatious in his\npreference of the writings of Mr Boz; would walk through the streets so\nabsorbed in them that he all but ran against Miss Jenkyns; and though\nhis apologies were earnest and sincere, and though he did not, in fact,\ndo more than startle her and himself, she owned to me she had rather he\nhad knocked her down, if he had only been reading a higher style of\nliterature.  The poor, brave Captain! he looked older, and more worn,\nand his clothes were very threadbare.  But he seemed as bright and\ncheerful as ever, unless he was asked about his daughter’s health.“She suffers a great deal, and she must suffer more: we do what we can\nto alleviate her pain;—God’s will be done!”  He took off his hat at\nthese last words.  I found, from Miss Matty, that everything had been\ndone, in fact.  A medical man, of high repute in that country\nneighbourhood, had been sent for, and every injunction he had given was\nattended to, regardless of expense.  Miss Matty was sure they denied\nthemselves many things in order to make the invalid comfortable; but\nthey never spoke about it; and as for Miss Jessie!—“I really think she’s\nan angel,” said poor Miss Matty, quite overcome.  “To see her way of\nbearing with Miss Brown’s crossness, and the bright face she puts on\nafter she’s been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it,\nis quite beautiful.  Yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the\nCaptain at breakfast-time as if she had been asleep in the Queen’s bed\nall night. My dear! you could never laugh at her prim little curls or\nher pink bows again if you saw her as I have done.”  I could only feel\nvery penitent, and greet Miss Jessie with double respect when I met her\nnext.  She looked faded and pinched; and her lips began to quiver, as if\nshe was very weak, when she spoke of her sister.  But she brightened,\nand sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes, as she\nsaid—“But, to be sure, what a town Cranford is for kindness!  I don’t suppose\nany one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all\ncomes in a little covered basin for my sister.  The poor people will\nleave their earliest vegetables at our door for her.  They speak short\nand gruff, as if they were ashamed of it: but I am sure it often goes to\nmy heart to see their thoughtfulness.”  The tears now came back and\noverflowed; but after a minute or two she began to scold herself, and\nended by going away the same cheerful Miss Jessie as ever.“But why does not this Lord Mauleverer do something for the man who\nsaved his life?” said I."

He did send game in the winter pretty often, but\nnow he is gone abroad.”I had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and\nsmall opportunities in Cranford; the rose-leaves that were gathered ere\nthey fell to make into a potpourri for someone who had no garden; the\nlittle bundles of lavender flowers sent to strew the drawers of some\ntown-dweller, or to burn in the chamber of some invalid.  Things that\nmany would despise, and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to\nperform, were all attended to in Cranford.  Miss Jenkyns stuck an apple\nfull of cloves, to be heated and smell pleasantly in Miss Brown’s room;\nand as she put in each clove she uttered a Johnsonian sentence.  Indeed,\nshe never could think of the Browns without talking Johnson; and, as\nthey were seldom absent from her thoughts just then, I heard many a\nrolling, three-piled sentence.Captain Brown called one day to thank Miss Jenkyns for many little\nkindnesses, which I did not know until then that she had rendered.  He\nhad suddenly become like an old man; his deep bass voice had a quavering\nin it, his eyes looked dim, and the lines on his face were deep.  He did\nnot—could not—speak cheerfully of his daughter’s state, but he talked\nwith manly, pious resignation, and not much.  Twice over he said, “What\nJessie has been to us, God only knows!” and after the second time, he\ngot up hastily, shook hands all round without speaking, and left the\nroom.That afternoon we perceived little groups in the street, all listening\nwith faces aghast to some tale or other.  Miss Jenkyns wondered what\ncould be the matter for some time before she took the undignified step\nof sending Jenny out to inquire.Jenny came back with a white face of terror.  “Oh, ma’am!  Oh, Miss\nJenkyns, ma’am!  Captain Brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads!”\nand she burst into tears.  She, along with many others, had experienced\nthe poor Captain’s kindness."

Jenny, don’t waste time in crying, but\ntell us something.”  Miss Matty rushed out into the street at once, and\ncollared the man who was telling the tale.[Picture: She brought the affrighted carter ... into the\ndrawing-room]“Come in—come to my sister at once, Miss Jenkyns, the rector’s daughter.\nOh, man, man! say it is not true,” she cried, as she brought the\naffrighted carter, sleeking down his hair, into the drawing-room, where\nhe stood with his wet boots on the new carpet, and no one regarded it.“Please, mum, it is true.  I seed it myself,” and he shuddered at the\nrecollection.  “The Captain was a-reading some new book as he was deep\nin, a-waiting for the down train; and there was a little lass as wanted\nto come to its mammy, and gave its sister the slip, and came toddling\nacross the line.  And he looked up sudden, at the sound of the train\ncoming, and seed the child, and he darted on the line and cotched it up,\nand his foot slipped, and the train came over him in no time.  O Lord,\nLord!  Mum, it’s quite true, and they’ve come over to tell his\ndaughters. The child’s safe, though, with only a bang on its shoulder as\nhe threw it to its mammy.  Poor Captain would be glad of that, mum,\nwouldn’t he?  God bless him!”  The great rough carter puckered up his\nmanly face, and turned away to hide his tears.  I turned to Miss\nJenkyns.  She looked very ill, as if she were going to faint, and signed\nto me to open the window.“Matilda, bring me my bonnet.  I must go to those girls.  God pardon me,\nif ever I have spoken contemptuously to the Captain!”Miss Jenkyns arrayed herself to go out, telling Miss Matilda to give the\nman a glass of wine.  While she was away, Miss Matty and I huddled over\nthe fire, talking in a low and awestruck voice.  I know we cried quietly\nall the time.Miss Jenkyns came home in a silent mood, and we durst not ask her many\nquestions.  She told us that Miss Jessie had fainted, and that she and\nMiss Pole had had some difficulty in bringing her round; but that, as\nsoon as she recovered, she begged one of them to go and sit with her\nsister."

She would be so utterly miserable, not merely at\nmy father’s death, but to think of what would become of me; she is so\ngood to me.”  She looked up earnestly in their faces with her soft true\neyes, and Miss Pole told Miss Jenkyns afterwards she could hardly bear\nit, knowing, as she did, how Miss Brown treated her sister.However, it was settled according to Miss Jessie’s wish.  Miss Brown was\nto be told her father had been summoned to take a short journey on\nrailway business.  They had managed it in some way—Miss Jenkyns could\nnot exactly say how.  Miss Pole was to stop with Miss Jessie.  Mrs\nJamieson had sent to inquire.  And this was all we heard that night; and\na sorrowful night it was.  The next day a full account of the fatal\naccident was in the county paper which Miss Jenkyns took in.  Her eyes\nwere very weak, she said, and she asked me to read it.  When I came to\nthe “gallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a number of\n‘Pickwick,’ which he had just received,” Miss Jenkyns shook her head\nlong and solemnly, and then sighed out, “Poor, dear, infatuated man!”The corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church, there\nto be interred.  Miss Jessie had set her heart on following it to the\ngrave; and no dissuasives could alter her resolve.  Her restraint upon\nherself made her almost obstinate; she resisted all Miss Pole’s\nentreaties and Miss Jenkyns’ advice.  At last Miss Jenkyns gave up the\npoint; and after a silence, which I feared portended some deep\ndispleasure against Miss Jessie, Miss Jenkyns said she should accompany\nthe latter to the funeral.“It is not fit for you to go alone.  It would be against both propriety\nand humanity were I to allow it.”"

  "content": "Miss Jessie seemed as if she did not half like this arrangement; but her\nobstinacy, if she had any, had been exhausted in her determination to go\nto the interment.  She longed, poor thing, I have no doubt, to cry alone\nover the grave of the dear father to whom she had been all in all, and\nto give way, for one little half-hour, uninterrupted by sympathy and\nunobserved by friendship.  But it was not to be.  That afternoon Miss\nJenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape, and employed herself busily\nin trimming the little black silk bonnet I have spoken about.  When it\nwas finished she put it on, and looked at us for approbation—admiration\nshe despised.  I was full of sorrow, but, by one of those whimsical\nthoughts which come unbidden into our heads, in times of deepest grief,\nI no sooner saw the bonnet than I was reminded of a helmet; and in that\nhybrid bonnet, half helmet, half jockey-cap, did Miss Jenkyns attend\nCaptain Brown’s funeral, and, I believe, supported Miss Jessie with a\ntender, indulgent firmness which was invaluable, allowing her to weep\nher passionate fill before they left.Miss Pole, Miss Matty, and I, meanwhile attended to Miss Brown: and hard\nwork we found it to relieve her querulous and never-ending complaints.\nBut if we were so weary and dispirited, what must Miss Jessie have been!\nYet she came back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength.  She\nput off her mourning dress, and came in, looking pale and gentle,\nthanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand.  She could even\nsmile—a faint, sweet, wintry smile—as if to reassure us of her power to\nendure; but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears, more than\nif she had cried outright.It was settled that Miss Pole was to remain with her all the watching\nlivelong night; and that Miss Matty and I were to return in the morning\nto relieve them, and give Miss Jessie the opportunity for a few hours of\nsleep.  But when the morning came, Miss Jenkyns appeared at the\nbreakfast-table, equipped in her helmet-bonnet, and ordered Miss Matty\nto stay at home, as she meant to go and help to nurse.  She was\nevidently in a state of great friendly excitement, which she showed by\neating her breakfast standing, and scolding the household all round.No nursing—no energetic strong-minded woman could help Miss Brown now.\nThere was that in the room as we entered which was stronger than us all,\nand made us shrink into solemn awestruck helplessness.  Miss Brown was\ndying.  We hardly knew her voice, it was so devoid of the complaining\ntone we had always associated with it.  Miss Jessie told me afterwards\nthat it, and her face too, were just what they had been formerly, when\nher mother’s death left her the young anxious head of the family, of\nwhom only Miss Jessie survived.She was conscious of her sister’s presence, though not, I think, of\nours. We stood a little behind the curtain: Miss Jessie knelt with her\nface near her sister’s, in order to catch the last soft awful whispers."

God forgive me!”“Hush, love! hush!” said Miss Jessie, sobbing.“And my father, my dear, dear father!  I will not complain now, if God\nwill give me strength to be patient.  But, oh, Jessie! tell my father\nhow I longed and yearned to see him at last, and to ask his forgiveness.\n He can never know now how I loved him—oh! if I might but tell him,\nbefore I die!  What a life of sorrow his has been, and I have done so\nlittle to cheer him!”A light came into Miss Jessie’s face.  “Would it comfort you, dearest,\nto think that he does know?—would it comfort you, love, to know that his\ncares, his sorrows”—Her voice quivered, but she steadied it into\ncalmness—“Mary! he has gone before you to the place where the weary are\nat rest.  He knows now how you loved him.”A strange look, which was not distress, came over Miss Brown’s face.\nShe did not speak for some time, but then we saw her lips form the\nwords, rather than heard the sound—“Father, mother, Harry, Archy;”—then,\nas if it were a new idea throwing a filmy shadow over her darkened\nmind—“But you will be alone, Jessie!”Miss Jessie had been feeling this all during the silence, I think; for\nthe tears rolled down her cheeks like rain, at these words, and she\ncould not answer at first.  Then she put her hands together tight, and\nlifted them up, and said—but not to us—“Though He slay me, yet will I\ntrust in Him.”In a few moments more Miss Brown lay calm and still—never to sorrow or\nmurmur more.After this second funeral, Miss Jenkyns insisted that Miss Jessie should\ncome to stay with her rather than go back to the desolate house, which,\nin fact, we learned from Miss Jessie, must now be given up, as she had\nnot wherewithal to maintain it.  She had something above twenty pounds a\nyear, besides the interest of the money for which the furniture would\nsell; but she could not live upon that: and so we talked over her\nqualifications for earning money."
