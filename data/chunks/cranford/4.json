He spoke such\npretty broken English, I could not help thinking of Thaddeus of Warsaw,\nand the Hungarian Brothers, and Santo Sebastiani; and while I was busy\npicturing his past life to myself, he had bowed me out of the room.  But\nwait a minute!  You have not heard half my story yet!  I was going\ndownstairs, when who should I meet but Betty’s second-cousin.  So, of\ncourse, I stopped to speak to her for Betty’s sake; and she told me that\nI had really seen the conjuror—the gentleman who spoke broken English\nwas Signor Brunoni himself.  Just at this moment he passed us on the\nstairs, making such a graceful bow! in reply to which I dropped a\ncurtsey—all foreigners have such polite manners, one catches something\nof it.  But when he had gone downstairs, I bethought me that I had\ndropped my glove in the Assembly Room (it was safe in my muff all the\ntime, but I never found it till afterwards); so I went back, and, just\nas I was creeping up the passage left on one side of the great screen\nthat goes nearly across the room, who should I see but the very same\ngentleman that had met me before, and passed me on the stairs, coming\nnow forwards from the inner part of the room, to which there is no\nentrance—you remember, Miss Matty—and just repeating, in his pretty\nbroken English, the inquiry if I had any business there—I don’t mean\nthat he put it quite so bluntly, but he seemed very determined that I\nshould not pass the screen—so, of course, I explained about my glove,\nwhich, curiously enough, I found at that very moment.”"

  "content": "Miss Pole, then, had seen the conjuror—the real, live conjuror! and\nnumerous were the questions we all asked her.  “Had he a beard?”  “Was\nhe young, or old?”  “Fair, or dark?”  “Did he look”—(unable to shape my\nquestion prudently, I put it in another form)—“How did he look?”  In\nshort, Miss Pole was the heroine of the evening, owing to her morning’s\nencounter.  If she was not the rose (that is to say the conjuror) she\nhad been near it.Conjuration, sleight of hand, magic, witchcraft, were the subjects of\nthe evening.  Miss Pole was slightly sceptical, and inclined to think\nthere might be a scientific solution found for even the proceedings of\nthe Witch of Endor.  Mrs Forrester believed everything, from ghosts to\ndeath-watches.  Miss Matty ranged between the two—always convinced by\nthe last speaker.  I think she was naturally more inclined to Mrs\nForrester’s side, but a desire of proving herself a worthy sister to\nMiss Jenkyns kept her equally balanced—Miss Jenkyns, who would never\nallow a servant to call the little rolls of tallow that formed\nthemselves round candles “winding-sheets,” but insisted on their being\nspoken of as “roley-poleys!”  A sister of hers to be superstitious!  It\nwould never do.After tea, I was despatched downstairs into the dining-parlour for that\nvolume of the old Encyclopædia which contained the nouns beginning with\nC, in order that Miss Pole might prime herself with scientific\nexplanations for the tricks of the following evening.  It spoilt the\npool at Preference which Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester had been looking\nforward to, for Miss Pole became so much absorbed in her subject, and\nthe plates by which it was illustrated, that we felt it would be cruel\nto disturb her otherwise than by one or two well-timed yawns, which I\nthrew in now and then, for I was really touched by the meek way in which\nthe two ladies were bearing their disappointment.  But Miss Pole only\nread the more zealously, imparting to us no more information than this—"

Put A\nbetween B and D—no! between C and F, and turn the second joint of the\nthird finger of your left hand over the wrist of your right H.  Very\nclear indeed!  My dear Mrs Forrester, conjuring and witchcraft is a mere\naffair of the alphabet.  Do let me read you this one passage?”Mrs Forrester implored Miss Pole to spare her, saying, from a child\nupwards, she never could understand being read aloud to; and I dropped\nthe pack of cards, which I had been shuffling very audibly, and by this\ndiscreet movement I obliged Miss Pole to perceive that Preference was to\nhave been the order of the evening, and to propose, rather unwillingly,\nthat the pool should commence.  The pleasant brightness that stole over\nthe other two ladies’ faces on this!  Miss Matty had one or two twinges\nof self-reproach for having interrupted Miss Pole in her studies: and\ndid not remember her cards well, or give her full attention to the game,\nuntil she had soothed her conscience by offering to lend the volume of\nthe Encyclopædia to Miss Pole, who accepted it thankfully, and said\nBetty should take it home when she came with the lantern.The next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea of\nthe gaiety before us.  Miss Matty went up to dress betimes, and hurried\nme until I was ready, when we found we had an hour-and-a-half to wait\nbefore the “doors opened at seven precisely.”  And we had only twenty\nyards to go!  However, as Miss Matty said, it would not do to get too\nmuch absorbed in anything, and forget the time; so she thought we had\nbetter sit quietly, without lighting the candles, till five minutes to\nseven.  So Miss Matty dozed, and I knitted.At length we set off; and at the door under the carriage-way at the\n“George,” we met Mrs Forrester and Miss Pole: the latter was discussing\nthe subject of the evening with more vehemence than ever, and throwing\nX’s and B’s at our heads like hailstones.  She had even copied one or\ntwo of the “receipts”—as she called them—for the different tricks, on\nbacks of letters, ready to explain and to detect Signor Brunoni’s arts."

  "content": "We went into the cloak-room adjoining the Assembly Room; Miss Matty gave\na sigh or two to her departed youth, and the remembrance of the last\ntime she had been there, as she adjusted her pretty new cap before the\nstrange, quaint old mirror in the cloak-room.  The Assembly Room had\nbeen added to the inn, about a hundred years before, by the different\ncounty families, who met together there once a month during the winter\nto dance and play at cards.  Many a county beauty had first swung\nthrough the minuet that she afterwards danced before Queen Charlotte in\nthis very room.  It was said that one of the Gunnings had graced the\napartment with her beauty; it was certain that a rich and beautiful\nwidow, Lady Williams, had here been smitten with the noble figure of a\nyoung artist, who was staying with some family in the neighbourhood for\nprofessional purposes, and accompanied his patrons to the Cranford\nAssembly.  And a pretty bargain poor Lady Williams had of her handsome\nhusband, if all tales were true.  Now, no beauty blushed and dimpled\nalong the sides of the Cranford Assembly Room; no handsome artist won\nhearts by his bow, _chapeau bras_ in hand; the old room was dingy; the\nsalmon-coloured paint had faded into a drab; great pieces of plaster had\nchipped off from the fine wreaths and festoons on its walls; but still a\nmouldy odour of aristocracy lingered about the place, and a dusty\nrecollection of the days that were gone made Miss Matty and Mrs\nForrester bridle up as they entered, and walk mincingly up the room, as\nif there were a number of genteel observers, instead of two little boys\nwith a stick of toffee between them with which to beguile the time.We stopped short at the second front row; I could hardly understand why,\nuntil I heard Miss Pole ask a stray waiter if any of the county families\nwere expected; and when he shook his head, and believed not, Mrs\nForrester and Miss Matty moved forwards, and our party represented a\nconversational square.  The front row was soon augmented and enriched by\nLady Glenmire and Mrs Jamieson.  We six occupied the two front rows, and\nour aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of shopkeepers\nwho strayed in from time to time and huddled together on the back\nbenches.  At least I conjectured so, from the noise they made, and the\nsonorous bumps they gave in sitting down; but when, in weariness of the\nobstinate green curtain that would not draw up, but would stare at me\nwith two odd eyes, seen through holes, as in the old tapestry story, I\nwould fain have looked round at the merry chattering people behind me,\nMiss Pole clutched my arm, and begged me not to turn, for “it was not\nthe thing.”  What “the thing” was, I never could find out, but it must\nhave been something eminently dull and tiresome.  However, we all sat\neyes right, square front, gazing at the tantalising curtain, and hardly\nspeaking intelligibly, we were so afraid of being caught in the\nvulgarity of making any noise in a place of public amusement.  Mrs\nJamieson was the most fortunate, for she fell asleep.At length the eyes disappeared—the curtain quivered—one side went up\nbefore the other, which stuck fast; it was dropped again, and, with a\nfresh effort, and a vigorous pull from some unseen hand, it flew up,\nrevealing to our sight a magnificent gentleman in the Turkish costume,\nseated before a little table, gazing at us (I should have said with the\nsame eyes that I had last seen through the hole in the curtain) with\ncalm and condescending dignity, “like a being of another sphere,” as I\nheard a sentimental voice ejaculate behind me."

Meanwhile, Miss Matty had reconnoitred through her eye-glass,\nwiped it, and looked again.  Then she turned round, and said to me, in a\nkind, mild, sorrowful tone—“You see, my dear, turbans _are_ worn.”But we had no time for more conversation.  The Grand Turk, as Miss Pole\nchose to call him, arose and announced himself as Signor Brunoni.“I don’t believe him!” exclaimed Miss Pole, in a defiant manner.  He\nlooked at her again, with the same dignified upbraiding in his\ncountenance.  “I don’t!” she repeated more positively than ever.\n“Signor Brunoni had not got that muffy sort of thing about his chin, but\nlooked like a close-shaved Christian gentleman.”Miss Pole’s energetic speeches had the good effect of wakening up Mrs\nJamieson, who opened her eyes wide, in sign of the deepest attention—a\nproceeding which silenced Miss Pole and encouraged the Grand Turk to\nproceed, which he did in very broken English—so broken that there was no\ncohesion between the parts of his sentences; a fact which he himself\nperceived at last, and so left off speaking and proceeded to action."

  "content": "Now we _were_ astonished.  How he did his tricks I could not imagine;\nno, not even when Miss Pole pulled out her pieces of paper and began\nreading aloud—or at least in a very audible whisper—the separate\n“receipts” for the most common of his tricks.  If ever I saw a man frown\nand look enraged, I saw the Grand Turk frown at Miss Pole; but, as she\nsaid, what could be expected but unchristian looks from a Mussulman?  If\nMiss Pole were sceptical, and more engrossed with her receipts and\ndiagrams than with his tricks, Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester were\nmystified and perplexed to the highest degree.  Mrs Jamieson kept taking\nher spectacles off and wiping them, as if she thought it was something\ndefective in them which made the legerdemain; and Lady Glenmire, who had\nseen many curious sights in Edinburgh, was very much struck with the\ntricks, and would not at all agree with Miss Pole, who declared that\nanybody could do them with a little practice, and that she would,\nherself, undertake to do all he did, with two hours given to study the\nEncyclopædia and make her third finger flexible.At last Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester became perfectly awestricken.  They\nwhispered together.  I sat just behind them, so I could not help hearing\nwhat they were saying.  Miss Matty asked Mrs Forrester “if she thought\nit was quite right to have come to see such things?  She could not help\nfearing they were lending encouragement to something that was not\nquite”— A little shake of the head filled up the blank.  Mrs Forrester\nreplied, that the same thought had crossed her mind; she too was feeling\nvery uncomfortable, it was so very strange.  She was quite certain that\nit was her pocket-handkerchief which was in that loaf just now; and it\nhad been in her own hand not five minutes before.  She wondered who had\nfurnished the bread?  She was sure it could not be Dakin, because he was\nthe churchwarden.  Suddenly Miss Matty half-turned towards me—“Will you look, my dear—you are a stranger in the town, and it won’t\ngive rise to unpleasant reports—will you just look round and see if the\nrector is here?  If he is, I think we may conclude that this wonderful\nman is sanctioned by the Church, and that will be a great relief to my\nmind.”I looked, and I saw the tall, thin, dry, dusty rector, sitting\nsurrounded by National School boys, guarded by troops of his own sex\nfrom any approach of the many Cranford spinsters.  His kind face was all\nagape with broad smiles, and the boys around him were in chinks of\nlaughing.  I told Miss Matty that the Church was smiling approval, which\nset her mind at ease.[Picture: Afraid of matrimonial reports]"

He was an old\nbachelor, but as afraid of matrimonial reports getting abroad about him\nas any girl of eighteen: and he would rush into a shop or dive down an\nentry, sooner than encounter any of the Cranford ladies in the street;\nand, as for the Preference parties, I did not wonder at his not\naccepting invitations to them.  To tell the truth, I always suspected\nMiss Pole of having given very vigorous chase to Mr Hayter when he first\ncame to Cranford; and not the less, because now she appeared to share so\nvividly in his dread lest her name should ever be coupled with his.  He\nfound all his interests among the poor and helpless; he had treated the\nNational School boys this very night to the performance; and virtue was\nfor once its own reward, for they guarded him right and left, and clung\nround him as if he had been the queen-bee and they the swarm.  He felt\nso safe in their environment that he could even afford to give our party\na bow as we filed out.  Miss Pole ignored his presence, and pretended to\nbe absorbed in convincing us that we had been cheated, and had not seen\nSignor Brunoni after all.CHAPTER X.\nTHE PANICI THINK a series of circumstances dated from Signor Brunoni’s visit to\nCranford, which seemed at the time connected in our minds with him,\nthough I don’t know that he had anything really to do with them.  All at\nonce all sorts of uncomfortable rumours got afloat in the town.  There\nwere one or two robberies—real _bonâ fide_ robberies; men had up before\nthe magistrates and committed for trial—and that seemed to make us all\nafraid of being robbed; and for a long time, at Miss Matty’s, I know, we\nused to make a regular expedition all round the kitchens and cellars\nevery night, Miss Matty leading the way, armed with the poker, I\nfollowing with the hearth-brush, and Martha carrying the shovel and\nfire-irons with which to sound the alarm; and by the accidental hitting\ntogether of them she often frightened us so much that we bolted\nourselves up, all three together, in the back-kitchen, or store-room, or\nwherever we happened to be, till, when our affright was over, we\nrecollected ourselves and set out afresh with double valiance.  By day\nwe heard strange stories from the shopkeepers and cottagers, of carts\nthat went about in the dead of night, drawn by horses shod with felt,\nand guarded by men in dark clothes, going round the town, no doubt in\nsearch of some unwatched house or some unfastened door."

But we discovered that she had begged one of Mr\nHoggins’s worn-out hats to hang up in her lobby, and we (at least I) had\ndoubts as to whether she really would enjoy the little adventure of\nhaving her house broken into, as she protested she should.  Miss Matty\nmade no secret of being an arrant coward, but she went regularly through\nher housekeeper’s duty of inspection—only the hour for this became\nearlier and earlier, till at last we went the rounds at half-past six,\nand Miss Matty adjourned to bed soon after seven, “in order to get the\nnight over the sooner.”Cranford had so long piqued itself on being an honest and moral town\nthat it had grown to fancy itself too genteel and well-bred to be\notherwise, and felt the stain upon its character at this time doubly.\nBut we comforted ourselves with the assurance which we gave to each\nother that the robberies could never have been committed by any Cranford\nperson; it must have been a stranger or strangers who brought this\ndisgrace upon the town, and occasioned as many precautions as if we were\nliving among the Red Indians or the French."

  "content": "This last comparison of our nightly state of defence and fortification\nwas made by Mrs Forrester, whose father had served under General\nBurgoyne in the American war, and whose husband had fought the French in\nSpain. She indeed inclined to the idea that, in some way, the French\nwere connected with the small thefts, which were ascertained facts, and\nthe burglaries and highway robberies, which were rumours.  She had been\ndeeply impressed with the idea of French spies at some time in her life;\nand the notion could never be fairly eradicated, but sprang up again\nfrom time to time.  And now her theory was this:—The Cranford people\nrespected themselves too much, and were too grateful to the aristocracy\nwho were so kind as to live near the town, ever to disgrace their\nbringing up by being dishonest or immoral; therefore, we must believe\nthat the robbers were strangers—if strangers, why not foreigners?—if\nforeigners, who so likely as the French?  Signor Brunoni spoke broken\nEnglish like a Frenchman; and, though he wore a turban like a Turk, Mrs\nForrester had seen a print of Madame de Staël with a turban on, and\nanother of Mr Denon in just such a dress as that in which the conjuror\nhad made his appearance, showing clearly that the French, as well as the\nTurks, wore turbans.  There could be no doubt Signor Brunoni was a\nFrenchman—a French spy come to discover the weak and undefended places\nof England, and doubtless he had his accomplices.  For her part, she,\nMrs Forrester, had always had her own opinion of Miss Pole’s adventure\nat the “George Inn”—seeing two men where only one was believed to be.\nFrench people had ways and means which, she was thankful to say, the\nEnglish knew nothing about; and she had never felt quite easy in her\nmind about going to see that conjuror—it was rather too much like a\nforbidden thing, though the rector was there.  In short, Mrs Forrester\ngrew more excited than we had ever known her before, and, being an\nofficer’s daughter and widow, we looked up to her opinion, of course."

  "content": "Really I do not know how much was true or false in the reports which\nflew about like wildfire just at this time; but it seemed to me then\nthat there was every reason to believe that at Mardon (a small town\nabout eight miles from Cranford) houses and shops were entered by holes\nmade in the walls, the bricks being silently carried away in the dead of\nthe night, and all done so quietly that no sound was heard either in or\nout of the house.  Miss Matty gave it up in despair when she heard of\nthis. “What was the use,” said she, “of locks and bolts, and bells to\nthe windows, and going round the house every night?  That last trick was\nfit for a conjuror.  Now she did believe that Signor Brunoni was at the\nbottom of it.”One afternoon, about five o’clock, we were startled by a hasty knock at\nthe door.  Miss Matty bade me run and tell Martha on no account to open\nthe door till she (Miss Matty) had reconnoitred through the window; and\nshe armed herself with a footstool to drop down on the head of the\nvisitor, in case he should show a face covered with black crape, as he\nlooked up in answer to her inquiry of who was there.  But it was nobody\nbut Miss Pole and Betty.  The former came upstairs, carrying a little\nhand-basket, and she was evidently in a state of great agitation.“Take care of that!” said she to me, as I offered to relieve her of her\nbasket.  “It’s my plate.  I am sure there is a plan to rob my house\nto-night.  I am come to throw myself on your hospitality, Miss Matty.\nBetty is going to sleep with her cousin at the ‘George.’  I can sit up\nhere all night if you will allow me; but my house is so far from any\nneighbours, and I don’t believe we could be heard if we screamed ever\nso!”“But,” said Miss Matty, “what has alarmed you so much?  Have you seen\nany men lurking about the house?”"

You\nsee, she said ‘mistress,’ though there was a hat hanging up in the hall,\nand it would have been more natural to have said ‘master.’  But Betty\nshut the door in her face, and came up to me, and we got the spoons\ntogether, and sat in the parlour-window watching till we saw Thomas\nJones going from his work, when we called to him and asked him to take\ncare of us into the town.”We might have triumphed over Miss Pole, who had professed such bravery\nuntil she was frightened; but we were too glad to perceive that she\nshared in the weaknesses of humanity to exult over her; and I gave up my\nroom to her very willingly, and shared Miss Matty’s bed for the night.\nBut before we retired, the two ladies rummaged up, out of the recesses\nof their memory, such horrid stories of robbery and murder that I quite\nquaked in my shoes.  Miss Pole was evidently anxious to prove that such\nterrible events had occurred within her experience that she was\njustified in her sudden panic; and Miss Matty did not like to be\noutdone, and capped every story with one yet more horrible, till it\nreminded me oddly enough, of an old story I had read somewhere, of a\nnightingale and a musician, who strove one against the other which could\nproduce the most admirable music, till poor Philomel dropped down dead.One of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards was of a\ngirl who was left in charge of a great house in Cumberland on some\nparticular fair-day, when the other servants all went off to the\ngaieties.  The family were away in London, and a pedlar came by, and\nasked to leave his large and heavy pack in the kitchen, saying he would\ncall for it again at night; and the girl (a gamekeeper’s daughter),\nroaming about in search of amusement, chanced to hit upon a gun hanging\nup in the hall, and took it down to look at the chasing; and it went off\nthrough the open kitchen door, hit the pack, and a slow dark thread of\nblood came oozing out. (How Miss Pole enjoyed this part of the story,\ndwelling on each word as if she loved it!)  She rather hurried over the\nfurther account of the girl’s bravery, and I have but a confused idea\nthat, somehow, she baffled the robbers with Italian irons, heated\nred-hot, and then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease."

Mrs Jamieson’s\nhouse had really been attacked; at least there were men’s footsteps to\nbe seen on the flower borders, underneath the kitchen windows, “where\nnae men should be;” and Carlo had barked all through the night as if\nstrangers were abroad.  Mrs Jamieson had been awakened by Lady Glenmire,\nand they had rung the bell which communicated with Mr Mulliner’s room in\nthe third storey, and when his night-capped head had appeared over the\nbannisters, in answer to the summons, they had told him of their alarm,\nand the reasons for it; whereupon he retreated into his bedroom, and\nlocked the door (for fear of draughts, as he informed them in the\nmorning), and opened the window, and called out valiantly to say, if the\nsupposed robbers would come to him he would fight them; but, as Lady\nGlenmire observed, that was but poor comfort, since they would have to\npass by Mrs Jamieson’s room and her own before they could reach him, and\nmust be of a very pugnacious disposition indeed if they neglected the\nopportunities of robbery presented by the unguarded lower storeys, to go\nup to a garret, and there force a door in order to get at the champion\nof the house.  Lady Glenmire, after waiting and listening for some time\nin the drawing-room, had proposed to Mrs Jamieson that they should go to\nbed; but that lady said she should not feel comfortable unless she sat\nup and watched; and, accordingly, she packed herself warmly up on the\nsofa, where she was found by the housemaid, when she came into the room\nat six o’clock, fast asleep; but Lady Glenmire went to bed, and kept\nawake all night.When Miss Pole heard of this, she nodded her head in great satisfaction.\nShe had been sure we should hear of something happening in Cranford that\nnight; and we had heard.  It was clear enough they had first proposed to\nattack her house; but when they saw that she and Betty were on their\nguard, and had carried off the plate, they had changed their tactics and\ngone to Mrs Jamieson’s, and no one knew what might have happened if\nCarlo had not barked, like a good dog as he was!Poor Carlo! his barking days were nearly over.  Whether the gang who\ninfested the neighbourhood were afraid of him, or whether they were\nrevengeful enough, for the way in which he had baffled them on the night\nin question, to poison him; or whether, as some among the more\nuneducated people thought, he died of apoplexy, brought on by too much\nfeeding and too little exercise; at any rate, it is certain that, two\ndays after this eventful night, Carlo was found dead, with his poor legs\nstretched out stiff in the attitude of running, as if by such unusual\nexertion he could escape the sure pursuer, Death.We were all sorry for Carlo, the old familiar friend who had snapped at\nus for so many years; and the mysterious mode of his death made us very\nuncomfortable.  Could Signor Brunoni be at the bottom of this?  He had\napparently killed a canary with only a word of command; his will seemed\nof deadly force; who knew but what he might yet be lingering in the\nneighbourhood willing all sorts of awful things!"

  "content": "We whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings; but in the\nmornings our courage came back with the daylight, and in a week’s time\nwe had got over the shock of Carlo’s death; all but Mrs Jamieson.  She,\npoor thing, felt it as she had felt no event since her husband’s death;\nindeed, Miss Pole said, that as the Honourable Mr Jamieson drank a good\ndeal, and occasioned her much uneasiness, it was possible that Carlo’s\ndeath might be the greater affliction.  But there was always a tinge of\ncynicism in Miss Pole’s remarks.  However, one thing was clear and\ncertain—it was necessary for Mrs Jamieson to have some change of scene;\nand Mr Mulliner was very impressive on this point, shaking his head\nwhenever we inquired after his mistress, and speaking of her loss of\nappetite and bad nights very ominously; and with justice too, for if she\nhad two characteristics in her natural state of health they were a\nfacility of eating and sleeping.  If she could neither eat nor sleep,\nshe must be indeed out of spirits and out of health.Lady Glenmire (who had evidently taken very kindly to Cranford) did not\nlike the idea of Mrs Jamieson’s going to Cheltenham, and more than once\ninsinuated pretty plainly that it was Mr Mulliner’s doing, who had been\nmuch alarmed on the occasion of the house being attacked, and since had\nsaid, more than once, that he felt it a very responsible charge to have\nto defend so many women.  Be that as it might, Mrs Jamieson went to\nCheltenham, escorted by Mr Mulliner; and Lady Glenmire remained in\npossession of the house, her ostensible office being to take care that\nthe maid-servants did not pick up followers.  She made a very\npleasant-looking dragon; and, as soon as it was arranged for her stay in\nCranford, she found out that Mrs Jamieson’s visit to Cheltenham was just\nthe best thing in the world.  She had let her house in Edinburgh, and\nwas for the time house-less, so the charge of her sister-in-law’s\ncomfortable abode was very convenient and acceptable.Miss Pole was very much inclined to instal herself as a heroine, because\nof the decided steps she had taken in flying from the two men and one\nwoman, whom she entitled “that murderous gang.”  She described their\nappearance in glowing colours, and I noticed that every time she went\nover the story some fresh trait of villainy was added to their\nappearance.  One was tall—he grew to be gigantic in height before we had\ndone with him; he of course had black hair—and by-and-by it hung in\nelf-locks over his forehead and down his back.  The other was short and\nbroad—and a hump sprouted out on his shoulder before we heard the last\nof him; he had red hair—which deepened into carroty; and she was almost\nsure he had a cast in the eye—a decided squint.  As for the woman, her\neyes glared, and she was masculine-looking—a perfect virago; most\nprobably a man dressed in woman’s clothes; afterwards, we heard of a\nbeard on her chin, and a manly voice and a stride."

Mr Hoggins, the surgeon, had been attacked at his own\ndoor by two ruffians, who were concealed in the shadow of the porch, and\nso effectually silenced him that he was robbed in the interval between\nringing his bell and the servant’s answering it.  Miss Pole was sure it\nwould turn out that this robbery had been committed by “her men,” and\nwent the very day she heard the report to have her teeth examined, and\nto question Mr Hoggins.  She came to us afterwards; so we heard what she\nhad heard, straight and direct from the source, while we were yet in the\nexcitement and flutter of the agitation caused by the first\nintelligence; for the event had only occurred the night before.“Well!” said Miss Pole, sitting down with the decision of a person who\nhas made up her mind as to the nature of life and the world (and such\npeople never tread lightly, or seat themselves without a bump), “well,\nMiss Matty! men will be men.  Every mother’s son of them wishes to be\nconsidered Samson and Solomon rolled into one—too strong ever to be\nbeaten or discomfited—too wise ever to be outwitted.  If you will\nnotice, they have always foreseen events, though they never tell one for\none’s warning before the events happen.  My father was a man, and I know\nthe sex pretty well.”She had talked herself out of breath, and we should have been very glad\nto fill up the necessary pause as chorus, but we did not exactly know\nwhat to say, or which man had suggested this diatribe against the sex;\nso we only joined in generally, with a grave shake of the head, and a\nsoft murmur of “They are very incomprehensible, certainly!”“Now, only think,” said she.  “There, I have undergone the risk of\nhaving one of my remaining teeth drawn (for one is terribly at the mercy\nof any surgeon-dentist; and I, for one, always speak them fair till I\nhave got my mouth out of their clutches), and, after all, Mr Hoggins is\ntoo much of a man to own that he was robbed last night.”“Not robbed!” exclaimed the chorus."

  "content": "“Don’t tell me!” Miss Pole exclaimed, angry that we could be for a\nmoment imposed upon.  “I believe he was robbed, just as Betty told me,\nand he is ashamed to own it; and, to be sure, it was very silly of him\nto be robbed just at his own door; I daresay he feels that such a thing\nwon’t raise him in the eyes of Cranford society, and is anxious to\nconceal it—but he need not have tried to impose upon me, by saying I\nmust have heard an exaggerated account of some petty theft of a neck of\nmutton, which, it seems, was stolen out of the safe in his yard last\nweek; he had the impertinence to add, he believed that that was taken by\nthe cat.  I have no doubt, if I could get at the bottom of it, it was\nthat Irishman dressed up in woman’s clothes, who came spying about my\nhouse, with the story about the starving children.”After we had duly condemned the want of candour which Mr Hoggins had\nevinced, and abused men in general, taking him for the representative\nand type, we got round to the subject about which we had been talking\nwhen Miss Pole came in; namely, how far, in the present disturbed state\nof the country, we could venture to accept an invitation which Miss\nMatty had just received from Mrs Forrester, to come as usual and keep\nthe anniversary of her wedding-day by drinking tea with her at five\no’clock, and playing a quiet pool afterwards.  Mrs Forrester had said\nthat she asked us with some diffidence, because the roads were, she\nfeared, very unsafe.  But she suggested that perhaps one of us would not\nobject to take the sedan, and that the others, by walking briskly, might\nkeep up with the long trot of the chairmen, and so we might all arrive\nsafely at Over Place, a suburb of the town.  (No; that is too large an\nexpression: a small cluster of houses separated from Cranford by about\ntwo hundred yards of a dark and lonely lane.)  There was no doubt but\nthat a similar note was awaiting Miss Pole at home; so her call was a\nvery fortunate affair, as it enabled us to consult together.  We would\nall much rather have declined this invitation; but we felt that it would\nnot be quite kind to Mrs Forrester, who would otherwise be left to a\nsolitary retrospect of her not very happy or fortunate life.  Miss Matty\nand Miss Pole had been visitors on this occasion for many years, and now\nthey gallantly determined to nail their colours to the mast, and to go\nthrough Darkness Lane rather than fail in loyalty to their friend."

  "content": "But when the evening came, Miss Matty (for it was she who was voted into\nthe chair, as she had a cold), before being shut down in the sedan, like\njack-in-a-box, implored the chairmen, whatever might befall, not to run\naway and leave her fastened up there, to be murdered; and even after\nthey had promised, I saw her tighten her features into the stern\ndetermination of a martyr, and she gave me a melancholy and ominous\nshake of the head through the glass.  However, we got there safely, only\nrather out of breath, for it was who could trot hardest through Darkness\nLane, and I am afraid poor Miss Matty was sadly jolted.Mrs Forrester had made extra preparations, in acknowledgment of our\nexertion in coming to see her through such dangers.  The usual forms of\ngenteel ignorance as to what her servants might send up were all gone\nthrough; and harmony and Preference seemed likely to be the order of the\nevening, but for an interesting conversation that began I don’t know\nhow, but which had relation, of course, to the robbers who infested the\nneighbourhood of Cranford."

  "content": "Having braved the dangers of Darkness Lane, and thus having a little\nstock of reputation for courage to fall back upon; and also, I daresay,\ndesirous of proving ourselves superior to men (_videlicet_ Mr Hoggins)\nin the article of candour, we began to relate our individual fears, and\nthe private precautions we each of us took.  I owned that my pet\napprehension was eyes—eyes looking at me, and watching me, glittering\nout from some dull, flat, wooden surface; and that if I dared to go up\nto my looking-glass when I was panic-stricken, I should certainly turn\nit round, with its back towards me, for fear of seeing eyes behind me\nlooking out of the darkness.  I saw Miss Matty nerving herself up for a\nconfession; and at last out it came.  She owned that, ever since she had\nbeen a girl, she had dreaded being caught by her last leg, just as she\nwas getting into bed, by some one concealed under it.  She said, when\nshe was younger and more active, she used to take a flying leap from a\ndistance, and so bring both her legs up safely into bed at once; but\nthat this had always annoyed Deborah, who piqued herself upon getting\ninto bed gracefully, and she had given it up in consequence.  But now\nthe old terror would often come over her, especially since Miss Pole’s\nhouse had been attacked (we had got quite to believe in the fact of the\nattack having taken place), and yet it was very unpleasant to think of\nlooking under a bed, and seeing a man concealed, with a great, fierce\nface staring out at you; so she had bethought herself of\nsomething—perhaps I had noticed that she had told Martha to buy her a\npenny ball, such as children play with—and now she rolled this ball\nunder the bed every night: if it came out on the other side, well and\ngood; if not she always took care to have her hand on the bell-rope, and\nmeant to call out John and Harry, just as if she expected men-servants\nto answer her ring.We all applauded this ingenious contrivance, and Miss Matty sank back\ninto satisfied silence, with a look at Mrs Forrester as if to ask for\n_her_ private weakness.Mrs Forrester looked askance at Miss Pole, and tried to change the\nsubject a little by telling us that she had borrowed a boy from one of\nthe neighbouring cottages and promised his parents a hundredweight of\ncoals at Christmas, and his supper every evening, for the loan of him at\nnights.  She had instructed him in his possible duties when he first\ncame; and, finding him sensible, she had given him the Major’s sword\n(the Major was her late husband), and desired him to put it very\ncarefully behind his pillow at night, turning the edge towards the head\nof the pillow.  He was a sharp lad, she was sure; for, spying out the\nMajor’s cocked hat, he had said, if he might have that to wear, he was\nsure he could frighten two Englishmen, or four Frenchmen any day.  But\nshe had impressed upon him anew that he was to lose no time in putting\non hats or anything else; but, if he heard any noise, he was to run at\nit with his drawn sword.  On my suggesting that some accident might\noccur from such slaughterous and indiscriminate directions, and that he\nmight rush on Jenny getting up to wash, and have spitted her before he\nhad discovered that she was not a Frenchman, Mrs Forrester said she did\nnot think that that was likely, for he was a very sound sleeper, and\ngenerally had to be well shaken or cold-pigged in a morning before they\ncould rouse him.  She sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to\nthe hearty suppers the poor lad ate, for he was half-starved at home,\nand she told Jenny to see that he got a good meal at night.[Picture: Slaughterous and indiscriminate directions]"

She paused, and stirred the fire, and snuffed the candles,\nand then she said, in a sounding whisper—“Ghosts!”She looked at Miss Pole, as much as to say, she had declared it, and\nwould stand by it.  Such a look was a challenge in itself.  Miss Pole\ncame down upon her with indigestion, spectral illusions, optical\ndelusions, and a great deal out of Dr Ferrier and Dr Hibbert besides.\nMiss Matty had rather a leaning to ghosts, as I have mentioned before,\nand what little she did say was all on Mrs Forrester’s side, who,\nemboldened by sympathy, protested that ghosts were a part of her\nreligion; that surely she, the widow of a major in the army, knew what\nto be frightened at, and what not; in short, I never saw Mrs Forrester\nso warm either before or since, for she was a gentle, meek, enduring old\nlady in most things.  Not all the elder-wine that ever was mulled could\nthis night wash out the remembrance of this difference between Miss Pole\nand her hostess.  Indeed, when the elder-wine was brought in, it gave\nrise to a new burst of discussion; for Jenny, the little maiden who\nstaggered under the tray, had to give evidence of having seen a ghost\nwith her own eyes, not so many nights ago, in Darkness Lane, the very\nlane we were to go through on our way home."

The conclusion I arrived at was, that Jenny had certainly\nseen something beyond what a fit of indigestion would have caused.  A\nlady all in white, and without her head, was what she deposed and\nadhered to, supported by a consciousness of the secret sympathy of her\nmistress under the withering scorn with which Miss Pole regarded her.\nAnd not only she, but many others, had seen this headless lady, who sat\nby the roadside wringing her hands as in deep grief.  Mrs Forrester\nlooked at us from time to time with an air of conscious triumph; but\nthen she had not to pass through Darkness Lane before she could bury\nherself beneath her own familiar bed-clothes.We preserved a discreet silence as to the headless lady while we were\nputting on our things to go home, for there was no knowing how near the\nghostly head and ears might be, or what spiritual connection they might\nbe keeping up with the unhappy body in Darkness Lane; and, therefore,\neven Miss Pole felt that it was as well not to speak lightly on such\nsubjects, for fear of vexing or insulting that woebegone trunk.  At\nleast, so I conjecture; for, instead of the busy clatter usual in the\noperation, we tied on our cloaks as sadly as mutes at a funeral.  Miss\nMatty drew the curtains round the windows of the chair to shut out\ndisagreeable sights, and the men (either because they were in spirits\nthat their labours were so nearly ended, or because they were going down\nhill), set off at such a round and merry pace, that it was all Miss Pole\nand I could do to keep up with them.  She had breath for nothing beyond\nan imploring “Don’t leave me!” uttered as she clutched my arm so tightly\nthat I could not have quitted her, ghost or no ghost.  What a relief it\nwas when the men, weary of their burden and their quick trot, stopped\njust where Headingley Causeway branches off from Darkness Lane!  Miss\nPole unloosed me and caught at one of the men—“Could not you—could not you take Miss Matty round by Headingley\nCauseway?—the pavement in Darkness Lane jolts so, and she is not very\nstrong.”A smothered voice was heard from the inside of the chair—“Oh! pray go on!  What is the matter?  What is the matter?  I will give\nyou sixpence more to go on very fast; pray don’t stop here.”“And I’ll give you a shilling,” said Miss Pole, with tremulous dignity,\n“if you’ll go by Headingley Causeway.”"

Miss Pole said to me, with a smile\nhalf-kindly and half-contemptuous upon her countenance, “I have been\njust telling Lady Glenmire of our poor friend Mrs Forrester, and her\nterror of ghosts.  It comes from living so much alone, and listening to\nthe bug-a-boo stories of that Jenny of hers.”  She was so calm and so\nmuch above superstitious fears herself that I was almost ashamed to say\nhow glad I had been of her Headingley Causeway proposition the night\nbefore, and turned off the conversation to something else."
