  "content": "Miss Jenkyns rang the bell, and told the servant who answered it to show\nMajor Gordon upstairs; and, presently, in walked a tall, fine,\nfrank-looking man of forty or upwards.  He shook hands with Miss Jessie;\nbut he could not see her eyes, she kept them so fixed on the ground.\nMiss Jenkyns asked me if I would come and help her to tie up the\npreserves in the store-room; and though Miss Jessie plucked at my gown,\nand even looked up at me with begging eye, I durst not refuse to go\nwhere Miss Jenkyns asked.  Instead of tying up preserves in the\nstore-room, however, we went to talk in the dining-room; and there Miss\nJenkyns told me what Major Gordon had told her; how he had served in the\nsame regiment with Captain Brown, and had become acquainted with Miss\nJessie, then a sweet-looking, blooming girl of eighteen; how the\nacquaintance had grown into love on his part, though it had been some\nyears before he had spoken; how, on becoming possessed, through the will\nof an uncle, of a good estate in Scotland, he had offered and been\nrefused, though with so much agitation and evident distress that he was\nsure she was not indifferent to him; and how he had discovered that the\nobstacle was the fell disease which was, even then, too surely\nthreatening her sister. She had mentioned that the surgeons foretold\nintense suffering; and there was no one but herself to nurse her poor\nMary, or cheer and comfort her father during the time of illness.  They\nhad had long discussions; and on her refusal to pledge herself to him as\nhis wife when all should be over, he had grown angry, and broken off\nentirely, and gone abroad, believing that she was a cold-hearted person\nwhom he would do well to forget.  He had been travelling in the East,\nand was on his return home when, at Rome, he saw the account of Captain\nBrown’s death in _Galignani_.Just then Miss Matty, who had been out all the morning, and had only\nlately returned to the house, burst in with a face of dismay and\noutraged propriety.“Oh, goodness me!” she said.  “Deborah, there’s a gentleman sitting in\nthe drawing-room with his arm round Miss Jessie’s waist!”  Miss Matty’s\neyes looked large with terror.[Picture: “With his arm around Miss Jessie’s waist!”]Miss Jenkyns snubbed her down in an instant.“The most proper place in the world for his arm to be in.  Go away,\nMatilda, and mind your own business.”  This from her sister, who had\nhitherto been a model of feminine decorum, was a blow for poor Miss\nMatty, and with a double shock she left the room.The last time I ever saw poor Miss Jenkyns was many years after this.\nMrs Gordon had kept up a warm and affectionate intercourse with all at\nCranford.  Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, and Miss Pole had all been to visit\nher, and returned with wonderful accounts of her house, her husband, her\ndress, and her looks.  For, with happiness, something of her early bloom\nreturned; she had been a year or two younger than we had taken her for.\nHer eyes were always lovely, and, as Mrs Gordon, her dimples were not\nout of place.  At the time to which I have referred, when I last saw\nMiss Jenkyns, that lady was old and feeble, and had lost something of\nher strong mind.  Little Flora Gordon was staying with the Misses\nJenkyns, and when I came in she was reading aloud to Miss Jenkyns, who\nlay feeble and changed on the sofa.  Flora put down the _Rambler_ when I\ncame in."

  "content": "“Ah!” said Miss Jenkyns, “you find me changed, my dear.  I can’t see as\nI used to do.  If Flora were not here to read to me, I hardly know how I\nshould get through the day.  Did you ever read the _Rambler_?  It’s a\nwonderful book—wonderful! and the most improving reading for Flora”\n(which I daresay it would have been, if she could have read half the\nwords without spelling, and could have understood the meaning of a\nthird), “better than that strange old book, with the queer name, poor\nCaptain Brown was killed for reading—that book by Mr Boz, you know—‘Old\nPoz’; when I was a girl—but that’s a long time ago—I acted Lucy in ‘Old\nPoz.’”  She babbled on long enough for Flora to get a good long spell at\nthe “Christmas Carol,” which Miss Matty had left on the table.CHAPTER III.\nA LOVE AFFAIR OF LONG AGOI THOUGHT that probably my connection with Cranford would cease after\nMiss Jenkyns’s death; at least, that it would have to be kept up by\ncorrespondence, which bears much the same relation to personal\nintercourse that the books of dried plants I sometimes see (“Hortus\nSiccus,” I think they call the thing) do to the living and fresh flowers\nin the lanes and meadows.  I was pleasantly surprised, therefore, by\nreceiving a letter from Miss Pole (who had always come in for a\nsupplementary week after my annual visit to Miss Jenkyns) proposing that\nI should go and stay with her; and then, in a couple of days after my\nacceptance, came a note from Miss Matty, in which, in a rather\ncircuitous and very humble manner, she told me how much pleasure I\nshould confer if I could spend a week or two with her, either before or\nafter I had been at Miss Pole’s; “for,” she said, “since my dear\nsister’s death I am well aware I have no attractions to offer; it is\nonly to the kindness of my friends that I can owe their company.”Of course I promised to come to dear Miss Matty as soon as I had ended\nmy visit to Miss Pole; and the day after my arrival at Cranford I went\nto see her, much wondering what the house would be like without Miss\nJenkyns, and rather dreading the changed aspect of things.  Miss Matty\nbegan to cry as soon as she saw me.  She was evidently nervous from\nhaving anticipated my call.  I comforted her as well as I could; and I\nfound the best consolation I could give was the honest praise that came\nfrom my heart as I spoke of the deceased.  Miss Matty slowly shook her\nhead over each virtue as it was named and attributed to her sister; and\nat last she could not restrain the tears which had long been silently\nflowing, but hid her face behind her handkerchief and sobbed aloud."

  "content": "“Dear Miss Matty,” said I, taking her hand—for indeed I did not know in\nwhat way to tell her how sorry I was for her, left deserted in the\nworld. She put down her handkerchief and said—“My dear, I’d rather you did not call me Matty.  She did not like it;\nbut I did many a thing she did not like, I’m afraid—and now she’s gone!\nIf you please, my love, will you call me Matilda?”I promised faithfully, and began to practise the new name with Miss Pole\nthat very day; and, by degrees, Miss Matilda’s feeling on the subject\nwas known through Cranford, and we all tried to drop the more familiar\nname, but with so little success that by-and-by we gave up the attempt.My visit to Miss Pole was very quiet.  Miss Jenkyns had so long taken\nthe lead in Cranford that now she was gone, they hardly knew how to give\na party.  The Honourable Mrs Jamieson, to whom Miss Jenkyns herself had\nalways yielded the post of honour, was fat and inert, and very much at\nthe mercy of her old servants.  If they chose that she should give a\nparty, they reminded her of the necessity for so doing: if not, she let\nit alone.  There was all the more time for me to hear old-world stories\nfrom Miss Pole, while she sat knitting, and I making my father’s shirts.\nI always took a quantity of plain sewing to Cranford; for, as we did not\nread much, or walk much, I found it a capital time to get through my\nwork.  One of Miss Pole’s stories related to a shadow of a love affair\nthat was dimly perceived or suspected long years before.Presently, the time arrived when I was to remove to Miss Matilda’s\nhouse. I found her timid and anxious about the arrangements for my\ncomfort. Many a time, while I was unpacking, did she come backwards and\nforwards to stir the fire which burned all the worse for being so\nfrequently poked.“Have you drawers enough, dear?” asked she.  “I don’t know exactly how\nmy sister used to arrange them.  She had capital methods.  I am sure she\nwould have trained a servant in a week to make a better fire than this,\nand Fanny has been with me four months.”"

  "content": "This subject of servants was a standing grievance, and I could not\nwonder much at it; for if gentlemen were scarce, and almost unheard of\nin the “genteel society” of Cranford, they or their\ncounterparts—handsome young men—abounded in the lower classes.  The\npretty neat servant-maids had their choice of desirable “followers”; and\ntheir mistresses, without having the sort of mysterious dread of men and\nmatrimony that Miss Matilda had, might well feel a little anxious lest\nthe heads of their comely maids should be turned by the joiner, or the\nbutcher, or the gardener, who were obliged, by their callings, to come\nto the house, and who, as ill-luck would have it, were generally\nhandsome and unmarried. Fanny’s lovers, if she had any—and Miss Matilda\nsuspected her of so many flirtations that, if she had not been very\npretty, I should have doubted her having one—were a constant anxiety to\nher mistress.  She was forbidden, by the articles of her engagement, to\nhave “followers”; and though she had answered, innocently enough,\ndoubling up the hem of her apron as she spoke, “Please, ma’am, I never\nhad more than one at a time,” Miss Matty prohibited that one.  But a\nvision of a man seemed to haunt the kitchen.  Fanny assured me that it\nwas all fancy, or else I should have said myself that I had seen a man’s\ncoat-tails whisk into the scullery once, when I went on an errand into\nthe store-room at night; and another evening, when, our watches having\nstopped, I went to look at the clock, there was a very odd appearance,\nsingularly like a young man squeezed up between the clock and the back\nof the open kitchen door: and I thought Fanny snatched up the candle\nvery hastily, so as to throw the shadow on the clock face, while she\nvery positively told me the time half-an-hour too early, as we found out\nafterwards by the church clock. But I did not add to Miss Matty’s\nanxieties by naming my suspicions, especially as Fanny said to me, the\nnext day, that it was such a queer kitchen for having odd shadows about\nit, she really was almost afraid to stay; “for you know, miss,” she\nadded, “I don’t see a creature from six o’clock tea, till Missus rings\nthe bell for prayers at ten.”"

  "content": "However, it so fell out that Fanny had to leave and Miss Matilda begged\nme to stay and “settle her” with the new maid; to which I consented,\nafter I had heard from my father that he did not want me at home.  The\nnew servant was a rough, honest-looking, country girl, who had only\nlived in a farm place before; but I liked her looks when she came to be\nhired; and I promised Miss Matilda to put her in the ways of the house.\nThe said ways were religiously such as Miss Matilda thought her sister\nwould approve.  Many a domestic rule and regulation had been a subject\nof plaintive whispered murmur to me during Miss Jenkyns’s life; but now\nthat she was gone, I do not think that even I, who was a favourite,\ndurst have suggested an alteration.  To give an instance: we constantly\nadhered to the forms which were observed, at meal-times, in “my father,\nthe rector’s house.”  Accordingly, we had always wine and dessert; but\nthe decanters were only filled when there was a party, and what remained\nwas seldom touched, though we had two wine-glasses apiece every day\nafter dinner, until the next festive occasion arrived, when the state of\nthe remainder wine was examined into in a family council.  The dregs\nwere often given to the poor: but occasionally, when a good deal had\nbeen left at the last party (five months ago, it might be), it was added\nto some of a fresh bottle, brought up from the cellar.  I fancy poor\nCaptain Brown did not much like wine, for I noticed he never finished\nhis first glass, and most military men take several.  Then, as to our\ndessert, Miss Jenkyns used to gather currants and gooseberries for it\nherself, which I sometimes thought would have tasted better fresh from\nthe trees; but then, as Miss Jenkyns observed, there would have been\nnothing for dessert in summer-time.  As it was, we felt very genteel\nwith our two glasses apiece, and a dish of gooseberries at the top, of\ncurrants and biscuits at the sides, and two decanters at the bottom.\nWhen oranges came in, a curious proceeding was gone through.  Miss\nJenkyns did not like to cut the fruit; for, as she observed, the juice\nall ran out nobody knew where; sucking (only I think she used some more\nrecondite word) was in fact the only way of enjoying oranges; but then\nthere was the unpleasant association with a ceremony frequently gone\nthrough by little babies; and so, after dessert, in orange season, Miss\nJenkyns and Miss Matty used to rise up, possess themselves each of an\norange in silence, and withdraw to the privacy of their own rooms to\nindulge in sucking oranges."

I held up a\nscreen, and did not look, and, as she said, she tried not to make the\nnoise very offensive; but now that she was left alone, she seemed quite\nhorrified when I begged her to remain with me in the warm\ndining-parlour, and enjoy her orange as she liked best.  And so it was\nin everything.  Miss Jenkyns’s rules were made more stringent than ever,\nbecause the framer of them was gone where there could be no appeal.  In\nall things else Miss Matilda was meek and undecided to a fault.  I have\nheard Fanny turn her round twenty times in a morning about dinner, just\nas the little hussy chose; and I sometimes fancied she worked on Miss\nMatilda’s weakness in order to bewilder her, and to make her feel more\nin the power of her clever servant.  I determined that I would not leave\nher till I had seen what sort of a person Martha was; and, if I found\nher trustworthy, I would tell her not to trouble her mistress with every\nlittle decision."

  "content": "Martha was blunt and plain-spoken to a fault; otherwise she was a brisk,\nwell-meaning, but very ignorant girl.  She had not been with us a week\nbefore Miss Matilda and I were astounded one morning by the receipt of a\nletter from a cousin of hers, who had been twenty or thirty years in\nIndia, and who had lately, as we had seen by the “Army List,” returned\nto England, bringing with him an invalid wife who had never been\nintroduced to her English relations.  Major Jenkyns wrote to propose\nthat he and his wife should spend a night at Cranford, on his way to\nScotland—at the inn, if it did not suit Miss Matilda to receive them\ninto her house; in which case they should hope to be with her as much as\npossible during the day. Of course it _must_ suit her, as she said; for\nall Cranford knew that she had her sister’s bedroom at liberty; but I am\nsure she wished the Major had stopped in India and forgotten his cousins\nout and out.“Oh! how must I manage?” asked she helplessly.  “If Deborah had been\nalive she would have known what to do with a gentleman-visitor.  Must I\nput razors in his dressing-room?  Dear! dear! and I’ve got none.\nDeborah would have had them.  And slippers, and coat-brushes?”  I\nsuggested that probably he would bring all these things with him.  “And\nafter dinner, how am I to know when to get up and leave him to his wine?\n Deborah would have done it so well; she would have been quite in her\nelement.  Will he want coffee, do you think?”  I undertook the\nmanagement of the coffee, and told her I would instruct Martha in the\nart of waiting—in which it must be owned she was terribly deficient—and\nthat I had no doubt Major and Mrs Jenkyns would understand the quiet\nmode in which a lady lived by herself in a country town.  But she was\nsadly fluttered.  I made her empty her decanters and bring up two fresh\nbottles of wine.  I wished I could have prevented her from being present\nat my instructions to Martha, for she frequently cut in with some fresh\ndirection, muddling the poor girl’s mind as she stood open-mouthed,\nlistening to us both.“Hand the vegetables round,” said I (foolishly, I see now—for it was\naiming at more than we could accomplish with quietness and simplicity);\nand then, seeing her look bewildered, I added, “take the vegetables\nround to people, and let them help themselves.”“And mind you go first to the ladies,” put in Miss Matilda.  “Always go\nto the ladies before gentlemen when you are waiting.”“I’ll do it as you tell me, ma’am,” said Martha; “but I like lads best.”We felt very uncomfortable and shocked at this speech of Martha’s, yet I\ndon’t think she meant any harm; and, on the whole, she attended very\nwell to our directions, except that she “nudged” the Major when he did\nnot help himself as soon as she expected to the potatoes, while she was\nhanding them round."

  "content": "The major and his wife were quiet unpretending people enough when they\ndid come; languid, as all East Indians are, I suppose.  We were rather\ndismayed at their bringing two servants with them, a Hindoo body-servant\nfor the Major, and a steady elderly maid for his wife; but they slept at\nthe inn, and took off a good deal of the responsibility by attending\ncarefully to their master’s and mistress’s comfort.  Martha, to be sure,\nhad never ended her staring at the East Indian’s white turban and brown\ncomplexion, and I saw that Miss Matilda shrunk away from him a little as\nhe waited at dinner.  Indeed, she asked me, when they were gone, if he\ndid not remind me of Blue Beard?  On the whole, the visit was most\nsatisfactory, and is a subject of conversation even now with Miss\nMatilda; at the time it greatly excited Cranford, and even stirred up\nthe apathetic and Honourable Mrs Jamieson to some expression of\ninterest, when I went to call and thank her for the kind answers she had\nvouchsafed to Miss Matilda’s inquiries as to the arrangement of a\ngentleman’s dressing-room—answers which I must confess she had given in\nthe wearied manner of the Scandinavian prophetess—“Leave me, leave me to repose.”And _now_ I come to the love affair.It seems that Miss Pole had a cousin, once or twice removed, who had\noffered to Miss Matty long ago.  Now this cousin lived four or five\nmiles from Cranford on his own estate; but his property was not large\nenough to entitle him to rank higher than a yeoman; or rather, with\nsomething of the “pride which apes humility,” he had refused to push\nhimself on, as so many of his class had done, into the ranks of the\nsquires.  He would not allow himself to be called Thomas Holbrook,\n_Esq._; he even sent back letters with this address, telling the\npost-mistress at Cranford that his name was _Mr_ Thomas Holbrook,\nyeoman.  He rejected all domestic innovations; he would have the house\ndoor stand open in summer and shut in winter, without knocker or bell to\nsummon a servant.  The closed fist or the knob of a stick did this\noffice for him if he found the door locked.  He despised every\nrefinement which had not its root deep down in humanity.  If people were\nnot ill, he saw no necessity for moderating his voice.  He spoke the\ndialect of the country in perfection, and constantly used it in\nconversation; although Miss Pole (who gave me these particulars) added,\nthat he read aloud more beautifully and with more feeling than any one\nshe had ever heard, except the late rector.“And how came Miss Matilda not to marry him?” asked I.“Oh, I don’t know.  She was willing enough, I think; but you know Cousin\nThomas would not have been enough of a gentleman for the rector and Miss\nJenkyns.”“Well! but they were not to marry him,” said I, impatiently.“No; but they did not like Miss Matty to marry below her rank.  You know\nshe was the rector’s daughter, and somehow they are related to Sir Peter\nArley: Miss Jenkyns thought a deal of that.”“Poor Miss Matty!” said I."

Miss Matty might not like him—and Miss Jenkyns might never\nhave said a word—it is only a guess of mine.”“Has she never seen him since?” I inquired.“No, I think not.  You see Woodley, Cousin Thomas’s house, lies half-way\nbetween Cranford and Misselton; and I know he made Misselton his\nmarket-town very soon after he had offered to Miss Matty; and I don’t\nthink he has been into Cranford above once or twice since—once, when I\nwas walking with Miss Matty, in High Street, and suddenly she darted\nfrom me, and went up Shire Lane.  A few minutes after I was startled by\nmeeting Cousin Thomas.”“How old is he?” I asked, after a pause of castle-building.“He must be about seventy, I think, my dear,” said Miss Pole, blowing up\nmy castle, as if by gun-powder, into small fragments.Very soon after—at least during my long visit to Miss Matilda—I had the\nopportunity of seeing Mr Holbrook; seeing, too, his first encounter with\nhis former love, after thirty or forty years’ separation.  I was helping\nto decide whether any of the new assortment of coloured silks which they\nhad just received at the shop would do to match a grey and black\nmousseline-delaine that wanted a new breadth, when a tall, thin, Don\nQuixote-looking old man came into the shop for some woollen gloves.  I\nhad never seen the person (who was rather striking) before, and I\nwatched him rather attentively while Miss Matty listened to the shopman.\n The stranger wore a blue coat with brass buttons, drab breeches, and\ngaiters, and drummed with his fingers on the counter until he was\nattended to. When he answered the shop-boy’s question, “What can I have\nthe pleasure of showing you to-day, sir?” I saw Miss Matilda start, and\nthen suddenly sit down; and instantly I guessed who it was.  She had\nmade some inquiry which had to be carried round to the other shopman.“Miss Jenkyns wants the black sarsenet two-and-twopence the yard”; and\nMr Holbrook had caught the name, and was across the shop in two strides."

I am happy\nto say my client, Miss Matilda, also left the shop in an equally\nbewildered state, not having purchased either green or red silk.  Mr\nHolbrook was evidently full with honest loud-spoken joy at meeting his\nold love again; he touched on the changes that had taken place; he even\nspoke of Miss Jenkyns as “Your poor sister!  Well, well! we have all our\nfaults”; and bade us good-bye with many a hope that he should soon see\nMiss Matty again.  She went straight to her room, and never came back\ntill our early tea-time, when I thought she looked as if she had been\ncrying.[Picture: Mr Holbrook ... bade us good-bye]CHAPTER IV.\nA VISIT TO AN OLD BACHELORA FEW days after, a note came from Mr Holbrook, asking us—impartially\nasking both of us—in a formal, old-fashioned style, to spend a day at\nhis house—a long June day—for it was June now.  He named that he had\nalso invited his cousin, Miss Pole; so that we might join in a fly,\nwhich could be put up at his house.I expected Miss Matty to jump at this invitation; but, no!  Miss Pole\nand I had the greatest difficulty in persuading her to go.  She thought\nit was improper; and was even half annoyed when we utterly ignored the\nidea of any impropriety in her going with two other ladies to see her\nold lover.  Then came a more serious difficulty.  She did not think\nDeborah would have liked her to go.  This took us half a day’s good hard\ntalking to get over; but, at the first sentence of relenting, I seized\nthe opportunity, and wrote and despatched an acceptance in her\nname—fixing day and hour, that all might be decided and done with."

She had\nevidently never been there before; and, although she little dreamt I\nknew anything of her early story, I could perceive she was in a tremor\nat the thought of seeing the place which might have been her home, and\nround which it is probable that many of her innocent girlish\nimaginations had clustered.  It was a long drive there, through paved\njolting lanes.  Miss Matilda sat bolt upright, and looked wistfully out\nof the windows as we drew near the end of our journey.  The aspect of\nthe country was quiet and pastoral.  Woodley stood among fields; and\nthere was an old-fashioned garden where roses and currant-bushes touched\neach other, and where the feathery asparagus formed a pretty background\nto the pinks and gilly-flowers; there was no drive up to the door.

  "content": "“I think it is very pretty,” said Miss Matty, with a soft plaintiveness\nin her voice, and almost in a whisper, for just then Mr Holbrook\nappeared at the door, rubbing his hands in very effervescence of\nhospitality.  He looked more like my idea of Don Quixote than ever, and\nyet the likeness was only external.  His respectable housekeeper stood\nmodestly at the door to bid us welcome; and, while she led the elder\nladies upstairs to a bedroom, I begged to look about the garden.  My\nrequest evidently pleased the old gentleman, who took me all round the\nplace and showed me his six-and-twenty cows, named after the different\nletters of the alphabet. As we went along, he surprised me occasionally\nby repeating apt and beautiful quotations from the poets, ranging easily\nfrom Shakespeare and George Herbert to those of our own day.  He did\nthis as naturally as if he were thinking aloud, and their true and\nbeautiful words were the best expression he could find for what he was\nthinking or feeling.  To be sure he called Byron “my Lord Byrron,” and\npronounced the name of Goethe strictly in accordance with the English\nsound of the letters—“As Goethe says, ‘Ye ever-verdant palaces,’” &c.\nAltogether, I never met with a man, before or since, who had spent so\nlong a life in a secluded and not impressive country, with\never-increasing delight in the daily and yearly change of season and\nbeauty.When he and I went in, we found that dinner was nearly ready in the\nkitchen—for so I suppose the room ought to be called, as there were oak\ndressers and cupboards all round, all over by the side of the fireplace,\nand only a small Turkey carpet in the middle of the flag-floor.  The\nroom might have been easily made into a handsome dark oak dining-parlour\nby removing the oven and a few other appurtenances of a kitchen, which\nwere evidently never used, the real cooking-place being at some\ndistance.  The room in which we were expected to sit was a\nstiffly-furnished, ugly apartment; but that in which we did sit was what\nMr Holbrook called the counting-house, where he paid his labourers their\nweekly wages at a great desk near the door.  The rest of the pretty\nsitting-room—looking into the orchard, and all covered over with dancing\ntree-shadows—was filled with books.  They lay on the ground, they\ncovered the walls, they strewed the table.  He was evidently half\nashamed and half proud of his extravagance in this respect.  They were\nof all kinds—poetry and wild weird tales prevailing.  He evidently chose\nhis books in accordance with his own tastes, not because such and such\nwere classical or established favourites.“Ah!” he said, “we farmers ought not to have much time for reading; yet\nsomehow one can’t help it.”“What a pretty room!” said Miss Matty, _sotto voce_.“What a pleasant place!” said I, aloud, almost simultaneously.“Nay! if you like it,” replied he; “but can you sit on these great,\nblack leather, three-cornered chairs?  I like it better than the best\nparlour; but I thought ladies would take that for the smarter place.”It was the smarter place, but, like most smart things, not at all\npretty, or pleasant, or home-like; so, while we were at dinner, the\nservant-girl dusted and scrubbed the counting-house chairs, and we sat\nthere all the rest of the day."

  "content": "We had pudding before meat; and I thought Mr Holbrook was going to make\nsome apology for his old-fashioned ways, for he began—“I don’t know whether you like newfangled ways.”“Oh, not at all!” said Miss Matty.“No more do I,” said he.  “My housekeeper _will_ have these in her new\nfashion; or else I tell her that, when I was a young man, we used to\nkeep strictly to my father’s rule, ‘No broth, no ball; no ball, no\nbeef’; and always began dinner with broth.  Then we had suet puddings,\nboiled in the broth with the beef: and then the meat itself.  If we did\nnot sup our broth, we had no ball, which we liked a deal better; and the\nbeef came last of all, and only those had it who had done justice to the\nbroth and the ball.  Now folks begin with sweet things, and turn their\ndinners topsy-turvy.”When the ducks and green peas came, we looked at each other in dismay;\nwe had only two-pronged, black-handled forks.  It is true the steel was\nas bright as silver; but what were we to do?  Miss Matty picked up her\npeas, one by one, on the point of the prongs, much as Aminé ate her\ngrains of rice after her previous feast with the Ghoul.  Miss Pole\nsighed over her delicate young peas as she left them on one side of her\nplate untasted, for they _would_ drop between the prongs.  I looked at\nmy host: the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,\nshovelled up by his large round-ended knife.  I saw, I imitated, I\nsurvived!  My friends, in spite of my precedent, could not muster up\ncourage enough to do an ungenteel thing; and, if Mr Holbrook had not\nbeen so heartily hungry, he would probably have seen that the good peas\nwent away almost untouched."

This was a compliment to a lady in his youth; but it was\nrather inappropriate to propose it as an honour to Miss Matty, who had\nbeen trained by her sister to hold smoking of every kind in utter\nabhorrence.  But if it was a shock to her refinement, it was also a\ngratification to her feelings to be thus selected; so she daintily\nstuffed the strong tobacco into the pipe, and then we withdrew.“It is very pleasant dining with a bachelor,” said Miss Matty softly, as\nwe settled ourselves in the counting-house.  “I only hope it is not\nimproper; so many pleasant things are!”“What a number of books he has!” said Miss Pole, looking round the room.\n“And how dusty they are!”“I think it must be like one of the great Dr Johnson’s rooms,” said Miss\nMatty.  “What a superior man your cousin must be!”“Yes!” said Miss Pole, “he’s a great reader; but I am afraid he has got\ninto very uncouth habits with living alone.”“Oh! uncouth is too hard a word.  I should call him eccentric; very\nclever people always are!” replied Miss Matty.[Picture: Now, what colour are ash-buds in March]When Mr Holbrook returned, he proposed a walk in the fields; but the two\nelder ladies were afraid of damp, and dirt, and had only very unbecoming\ncalashes to put on over their caps; so they declined, and I was again\nhis companion in a turn which he said he was obliged to take to see\nafter his men.  He strode along, either wholly forgetting my existence,\nor soothed into silence by his pipe—and yet it was not silence exactly.\nHe walked before me with a stooping gait, his hands clasped behind him;\nand, as some tree or cloud, or glimpse of distant upland pastures,\nstruck him, he quoted poetry to himself, saying it out loud in a grand\nsonorous voice, with just the emphasis that true feeling and\nappreciation give.  We came upon an old cedar tree, which stood at one\nend of the house—“The cedar spreads his dark-green layers of shade.”“Capital term—‘layers!’  Wonderful man!”  I did not know whether he was\nspeaking to me or not; but I put in an assenting “wonderful,” although I\nknew nothing about it, just because I was tired of being forgotten, and\nof being consequently silent."

Now, what colour are ash-buds in March?”Is the man going mad? thought I.  He is very like Don Quixote.“What colour are they, I say?” repeated he vehemently.“I am sure I don’t know, sir,” said I, with the meekness of ignorance.“I knew you didn’t.  No more did I—an old fool that I am!—till this\nyoung man comes and tells me.  Black as ash-buds in March.  And I’ve\nlived all my life in the country; more shame for me not to know.  Black:\nthey are jet-black, madam.”  And he went off again, swinging along to\nthe music of some rhyme he had got hold of.When we came back, nothing would serve him but he must read us the poems\nhe had been speaking of; and Miss Pole encouraged him in his proposal, I\nthought, because she wished me to hear his beautiful reading, of which\nshe had boasted; but she afterwards said it was because she had got to a\ndifficult part of her crochet, and wanted to count her stitches without\nhaving to talk.  Whatever he had proposed would have been right to Miss\nMatty; although she did fall sound asleep within five minutes after he\nhad begun a long poem, called “Locksley Hall,” and had a comfortable\nnap, unobserved, till he ended; when the cessation of his voice wakened\nher up, and she said, feeling that something was expected, and that Miss\nPole was counting—“What a pretty book!”“Pretty, madam! it’s beautiful!  Pretty, indeed!”“Oh yes!  I meant beautiful!” said she, fluttered at his disapproval of\nher word.  “It is so like that beautiful poem of Dr Johnson’s my sister\nused to read—I forget the name of it; what was it, my dear?” turning to\nme.“Which do you mean, ma’am?  What was it about?”“I don’t remember what it was about, and I’ve quite forgotten what the\nname of it was; but it was written by Dr Johnson, and was very\nbeautiful, and very like what Mr Holbrook has just been reading.”“I don’t remember it,” said he reflectively.  “But I don’t know Dr\nJohnson’s poems well.  I must read them.”"

It’s no better than muslin.  At your age, ma’am, you should be\ncareful.”“My age!” said Miss Matty, almost speaking crossly, for her, for she was\nusually gentle—“My age!  Why, how old do you think I am, that you talk\nabout my age?”“Well, ma’am, I should say you were not far short of sixty: but folks’\nlooks is often against them—and I’m sure I meant no harm.”“Martha, I’m not yet fifty-two!” said Miss Matty, with grave emphasis;\nfor probably the remembrance of her youth had come very vividly before\nher this day, and she was annoyed at finding that golden time so far\naway in the past.But she never spoke of any former and more intimate acquaintance with Mr\nHolbrook.  She had probably met with so little sympathy in her early\nlove, that she had shut it up close in her heart; and it was only by a\nsort of watching, which I could hardly avoid since Miss Pole’s\nconfidence, that I saw how faithful her poor heart had been in its\nsorrow and its silence.She gave me some good reason for wearing her best cap every day, and sat\nnear the window, in spite of her rheumatism, in order to see, without\nbeing seen, down into the street.He came.  He put his open palms upon his knees, which were far apart, as\nhe sat with his head bent down, whistling, after we had replied to his\ninquiries about our safe return.  Suddenly he jumped up—“Well, madam! have you any commands for Paris?  I am going there in a\nweek or two.”“To Paris!” we both exclaimed.“Yes, madam!  I’ve never been there, and always had a wish to go; and I\nthink if I don’t go soon, I mayn’t go at all; so as soon as the hay is\ngot in I shall go, before harvest time.”We were so much astonished that we had no commissions.Just as he was going out of the room, he turned back, with his favourite\nexclamation—"

Here are\nthe poems for you you admired so much the other evening at my house.”\nHe tugged away at a parcel in his coat-pocket.  “Good-bye, miss,” said\nhe; “good-bye, Matty! take care of yourself.”  And he was gone.  But he\nhad given her a book, and he had called her Matty, just as he used to do\nthirty years ago.“I wish he would not go to Paris,” said Miss Matilda anxiously.  “I\ndon’t believe frogs will agree with him; he used to have to be very\ncareful what he ate, which was curious in so strong-looking a young\nman.”Soon after this I took my leave, giving many an injunction to Martha to\nlook after her mistress, and to let me know if she thought that Miss\nMatilda was not so well; in which case I would volunteer a visit to my\nold friend, without noticing Martha’s intelligence to her.Accordingly I received a line or two from Martha every now and then;\nand, about November I had a note to say her mistress was “very low and\nsadly off her food”; and the account made me so uneasy that, although\nMartha did not decidedly summon me, I packed up my things and went.I received a warm welcome, in spite of the little flurry produced by my\nimpromptu visit, for I had only been able to give a day’s notice.  Miss\nMatilda looked miserably ill; and I prepared to comfort and cosset her.I went down to have a private talk with Martha.“How long has your mistress been so poorly?” I asked, as I stood by the\nkitchen fire.“Well!  I think it’s better than a fortnight; it is, I know; it was one\nTuesday, after Miss Pole had been, that she went into this moping way.\nI thought she was tired, and it would go off with a night’s rest; but\nno! she has gone on and on ever since, till I thought it my duty to\nwrite to you, ma’am.”“You did quite right, Martha.  It is a comfort to think she has so\nfaithful a servant about her.  And I hope you find your place\ncomfortable?”“Well, ma’am, missus is very kind, and there’s plenty to eat and drink,\nand no more work but what I can do easily—but—” Martha hesitated.“But what, Martha?”"

Many a girl\nas I know would have ’em unbeknownst to missus; but I’ve given my word,\nand I’ll stick to it; or else this is just the house for missus never to\nbe the wiser if they did come: and it’s such a capable kitchen—there’s\nsuch dark corners in it—I’d be bound to hide any one.  I counted up last\nSunday night—for I’ll not deny I was crying because I had to shut the\ndoor in Jem Hearn’s face, and he’s a steady young man, fit for any girl;\nonly I had given missus my word.”  Martha was all but crying again; and\nI had little comfort to give her, for I knew, from old experience, of\nthe horror with which both the Miss Jenkynses looked upon “followers”;\nand in Miss Matty’s present nervous state this dread was not likely to\nbe lessened.I went to see Miss Pole the next day, and took her completely by\nsurprise, for she had not been to see Miss Matilda for two days.“And now I must go back with you, my dear, for I promised to let her\nknow how Thomas Holbrook went on; and, I’m sorry to say, his housekeeper\nhas sent me word to-day that he hasn’t long to live.  Poor Thomas! that\njourney to Paris was quite too much for him.  His housekeeper says he\nhas hardly ever been round his fields since, but just sits with his\nhands on his knees in the counting-house, not reading or anything, but\nonly saying what a wonderful city Paris was!  Paris has much to answer\nfor if it’s killed my cousin Thomas, for a better man never lived.”“Does Miss Matilda know of his illness?” asked I—a new light as to the\ncause of her indisposition dawning upon me.“Dear! to be sure, yes!

I felt almost guilty\nof having spied too curiously into that tender heart, and I was not\ngoing to speak of its secrets—hidden, Miss Matty believed, from all the\nworld. I ushered Miss Pole into Miss Matilda’s little drawing-room, and\nthen left them alone.  But I was not surprised when Martha came to my\nbedroom door, to ask me to go down to dinner alone, for that missus had\none of her bad headaches.  She came into the drawing-room at tea-time,\nbut it was evidently an effort to her; and, as if to make up for some\nreproachful feeling against her late sister, Miss Jenkyns, which had\nbeen troubling her all the afternoon, and for which she now felt\npenitent, she kept telling me how good and how clever Deborah was in her\nyouth; how she used to settle what gowns they were to wear at all the\nparties (faint, ghostly ideas of grim parties, far away in the distance,\nwhen Miss Matty and Miss Pole were young!); and how Deborah and her\nmother had started the benefit society for the poor, and taught girls\ncooking and plain sewing; and how Deborah had once danced with a lord;\nand how she used to visit at Sir Peter Arley’s, and tried to remodel the\nquiet rectory establishment on the plans of Arley Hall, where they kept\nthirty servants; and how she had nursed Miss Matty through a long, long\nillness, of which I had never heard before, but which I now dated in my\nown mind as following the dismissal of the suit of Mr Holbrook.  So we\ntalked softly and quietly of old times through the long November\nevening.The next day Miss Pole brought us word that Mr Holbrook was dead.  Miss\nMatty heard the news in silence; in fact, from the account of the\nprevious day, it was only what we had to expect.  Miss Pole kept calling\nupon us for some expression of regret, by asking if it was not sad that\nhe was gone, and saying—“To think of that pleasant day last June, when he seemed so well!  And\nhe might have lived this dozen years if he had not gone to that wicked\nParis, where they are always having revolutions.”She paused for some demonstration on our part.  I saw Miss Matty could\nnot speak, she was trembling so nervously; so I said what I really felt;\nand after a call of some duration—all the time of which I have no doubt\nMiss Pole thought Miss Matty received the news very calmly—our visitor\ntook her leave.Miss Matty made a strong effort to conceal her feelings—a concealment\nshe practised even with me, for she has never alluded to Mr Holbrook\nagain, although the book he gave her lies with her Bible on the little\ntable by her bedside.  She did not think I heard her when she asked the\nlittle milliner of Cranford to make her caps something like the\nHonourable Mrs Jamieson’s, or that I noticed the reply—“But she wears widows’ caps, ma’am?”“Oh!  I only meant something in that style; not widows’, of course, but\nrather like Mrs Jamieson’s.”This effort at concealment was the beginning of the tremulous motion of\nhead and hands which I have seen ever since in Miss Matty.The evening of the day on which we heard of Mr Holbrook’s death, Miss\nMatilda was very silent and thoughtful; after prayers she called Martha\nback and then she stood uncertain what to say.“Martha!” she said, at last, “you are young”—and then she made so long a\npause that Martha, to remind her of her half-finished sentence, dropped\na curtsey, and said—“Yes, please, ma’am; two-and-twenty last third of October, please,\nma’am.”"
