Believe\nme, I do not forget the situation my father held under yours.”“And Mrs Forrester, of course?”“And Mrs Forrester.  I thought, in fact, of going to her before I went\nto Miss Pole.  Although her circumstances are changed, madam, she was\nborn at Tyrrell, and we can never forget her alliance to the Bigges, of\nBigelow Hall.”Miss Matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her being a\nvery good card-player.“Mrs Fitz-Adam—I suppose”—“No, madam.  I must draw a line somewhere.  Mrs Jamieson would not, I\nthink, like to meet Mrs Fitz-Adam.  I have the greatest respect for Mrs\nFitz-Adam—but I cannot think her fit society for such ladies as Mrs\nJamieson and Miss Matilda Jenkyns.”Miss Betty Barker bowed low to Miss Matty, and pursed up her mouth.  She\nlooked at me with sidelong dignity, as much as to say, although a\nretired milliner, she was no democrat, and understood the difference of\nranks.“May I beg you to come as near half-past six to my little dwelling, as\npossible, Miss Matilda?  Mrs Jamieson dines at five, but has kindly\npromised not to delay her visit beyond that time—half-past six.”  And\nwith a swimming curtsey Miss Betty Barker took her leave.My prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from Miss Pole, who\nusually came to call on Miss Matilda after any event—or indeed in sight\nof any event—to talk it over with her.“Miss Betty told me it was to be a choice and select few,” said Miss\nPole, as she and Miss Matty compared notes.“Yes, so she said.  Not even Mrs Fitz-Adam.”"

  "content": "Now Mrs Fitz-Adam was the widowed sister of the Cranford surgeon, whom I\nhave named before.  Their parents were respectable farmers, content with\ntheir station.  The name of these good people was Hoggins.  Mr Hoggins\nwas the Cranford doctor now; we disliked the name and considered it\ncoarse; but, as Miss Jenkyns said, if he changed it to Piggins it would\nnot be much better.  We had hoped to discover a relationship between him\nand that Marchioness of Exeter whose name was Molly Hoggins; but the\nman, careless of his own interests, utterly ignored and denied any such\nrelationship, although, as dear Miss Jenkyns had said, he had a sister\ncalled Mary, and the same Christian names were very apt to run in\nfamilies.Soon after Miss Mary Hoggins married Mr Fitz-Adam, she disappeared from\nthe neighbourhood for many years.  She did not move in a sphere in\nCranford society sufficiently high to make any of us care to know what\nMr Fitz-Adam was.  He died and was gathered to his fathers without our\never having thought about him at all.  And then Mrs Fitz-Adam reappeared\nin Cranford (“as bold as a lion,” Miss Pole said), a well-to-do widow,\ndressed in rustling black silk, so soon after her husband’s death that\npoor Miss Jenkyns was justified in the remark she made, that “bombazine\nwould have shown a deeper sense of her loss.”I remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide whether or\nnot Mrs Fitz-Adam should be called upon by the old blue-blooded\ninhabitants of Cranford.  She had taken a large rambling house, which\nhad been usually considered to confer a patent of gentility upon its\ntenant, because, once upon a time, seventy or eighty years before, the\nspinster daughter of an earl had resided in it.  I am not sure if the\ninhabiting this house was not also believed to convey some unusual power\nof intellect; for the earl’s daughter, Lady Jane, had a sister, Lady\nAnne, who had married a general officer in the time of the American war,\nand this general officer had written one or two comedies, which were\nstill acted on the London boards, and which, when we saw them\nadvertised, made us all draw up, and feel that Drury Lane was paying a\nvery pretty compliment to Cranford.  Still, it was not at all a settled\nthing that Mrs Fitz-Adam was to be visited, when dear Miss Jenkyns died;\nand, with her, something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of\ngentility went out too.  As Miss Pole observed, “As most of the ladies\nof good family in Cranford were elderly spinsters, or widows without\nchildren, if we did not relax a little, and become less exclusive,\nby-and-by we should have no society at all.”Mrs Forrester continued on the same side."

  "content": "“She had always understood that Fitz meant something aristocratic; there\nwas Fitz-Roy—she thought that some of the King’s children had been\ncalled Fitz-Roy; and there was Fitz-Clarence, now—they were the children\nof dear good King William the Fourth.  Fitz-Adam!—it was a pretty name,\nand she thought it very probably meant ‘Child of Adam.’  No one, who had\nnot some good blood in their veins, would dare to be called Fitz; there\nwas a deal in a name—she had had a cousin who spelt his name with two\nlittle ffs—ffoulkes—and he always looked down upon capital letters and\nsaid they belonged to lately-invented families.  She had been afraid he\nwould die a bachelor, he was so very choice.  When he met with a Mrs\nffarringdon, at a watering-place, he took to her immediately; and a very\npretty genteel woman she was—a widow, with a very good fortune; and ‘my\ncousin,’ Mr ffoulkes, married her; and it was all owing to her two\nlittle ffs.”Mrs Fitz-Adam did not stand a chance of meeting with a Mr Fitz-anything\nin Cranford, so that could not have been her motive for settling there.\nMiss Matty thought it might have been the hope of being admitted into\nthe society of the place, which would certainly be a very agreeable rise\nfor _ci-devant_ Miss Hoggins; and if this had been her hope it would be\ncruel to disappoint her.So everybody called upon Mrs Fitz-Adam—everybody but Mrs Jamieson, who\nused to show how honourable she was by never seeing Mrs Fitz-Adam when\nthey met at the Cranford parties.  There would be only eight or ten\nladies in the room, and Mrs Fitz-Adam was the largest of all, and she\ninvariably used to stand up when Mrs Jamieson came in, and curtsey very\nlow to her whenever she turned in her direction—so low, in fact, that I\nthink Mrs Jamieson must have looked at the wall above her, for she never\nmoved a muscle of her face, no more than if she had not seen her.  Still\nMrs Fitz-Adam persevered.The spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or four\nladies in calashes met at Miss Barker’s door.  Do you know what a\ncalash is?  It is a covering worn over caps, not unlike the heads\nfastened on old-fashioned gigs; but sometimes it is not quite so large.\nThis kind of head-gear always made an awful impression on the children\nin Cranford; and now two or three left off their play in the quiet\nsunny little street, and gathered in wondering silence round Miss Pole,\nMiss Matty, and myself.  We were silent too, so that we could hear\nloud, suppressed whispers inside Miss Barker’s house: “Wait, Peggy! wait\ntill I’ve run upstairs and washed my hands.  When I cough, open the\ndoor; I’ll not be a minute.”"

  "content": "And, true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise, between a\nsneeze and a crow; on which the door flew open.  Behind it stood a\nround-eyed maiden, all aghast at the honourable company of calashes, who\nmarched in without a word.  She recovered presence of mind enough to\nusher us into a small room, which had been the shop, but was now\nconverted into a temporary dressing-room.  There we unpinned and shook\nourselves, and arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and\ngracious company-face; and then, bowing backwards with “After you,\nma’am,” we allowed Mrs Forrester to take precedence up the narrow\nstaircase that led to Miss Barker’s drawing-room.  There she sat, as\nstately and composed as though we had never heard that odd-sounding\ncough, from which her throat must have been even then sore and rough.\nKind, gentle, shabbily-dressed Mrs Forrester was immediately conducted\nto the second place of honour—a seat arranged something like Prince\nAlbert’s near the Queen’s—good, but not so good.  The place of\npre-eminence was, of course, reserved for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson,\nwho presently came panting up the stairs—Carlo rushing round her on her\nprogress, as if he meant to trip her up.And now Miss Betty Barker was a proud and happy woman!  She stirred the\nfire, and shut the door, and sat as near to it as she could, quite on\nthe edge of her chair.  When Peggy came in, tottering under the weight\nof the tea-tray, I noticed that Miss Barker was sadly afraid lest Peggy\nshould not keep her distance sufficiently.  She and her mistress were on\nvery familiar terms in their every-day intercourse, and Peggy wanted now\nto make several little confidences to her, which Miss Barker was on\nthorns to hear, but which she thought it her duty, as a lady, to\nrepress.  So she turned away from all Peggy’s asides and signs; but she\nmade one or two very malapropos answers to what was said; and at last,\nseized with a bright idea, she exclaimed, “Poor, sweet Carlo!  I’m\nforgetting him. Come downstairs with me, poor ittie doggie, and it shall\nhave its tea, it shall!”In a few minutes she returned, bland and benignant as before; but I\nthought she had forgotten to give the “poor ittie doggie” anything to\neat, judging by the avidity with which he swallowed down chance pieces\nof cake.  The tea-tray was abundantly loaded—I was pleased to see it, I\nwas so hungry; but I was afraid the ladies present might think it\nvulgarly heaped up.  I know they would have done at their own houses;\nbut somehow the heaps disappeared here.  I saw Mrs Jamieson eating\nseed-cake, slowly and considerately, as she did everything; and I was\nrather surprised, for I knew she had told us, on the occasion of her\nlast party, that she never had it in her house, it reminded her so much\nof scented soap.  She always gave us Savoy biscuits.  However, Mrs\nJamieson was kindly indulgent to Miss Barker’s want of knowledge of the\ncustoms of high life; and, to spare her feelings, ate three large pieces\nof seed-cake, with a placid, ruminating expression of countenance, not\nunlike a cow’s."

  "content": "After tea there was some little demur and difficulty.  We were six in\nnumber; four could play at Preference, and for the other two there was\nCribbage.  But all, except myself (I was rather afraid of the Cranford\nladies at cards, for it was the most earnest and serious business they\never engaged in), were anxious to be of the “pool.”  Even Miss Barker,\nwhile declaring she did not know Spadille from Manille, was evidently\nhankering to take a hand.  The dilemma was soon put an end to by a\nsingular kind of noise.  If a baron’s daughter-in-law could ever be\nsupposed to snore, I should have said Mrs Jamieson did so then; for,\novercome by the heat of the room, and inclined to doze by nature, the\ntemptation of that very comfortable arm-chair had been too much for her,\nand Mrs Jamieson was nodding.  Once or twice she opened her eyes with an\neffort, and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us; but by-and-by, even\nher benevolence was not equal to this exertion, and she was sound\nasleep.[Picture: The temptation of the comfortable arm-chair had been too much\n                                 for her]“It is very gratifying to me,” whispered Miss Barker at the card-table\nto her three opponents, whom, notwithstanding her ignorance of the game,\nshe was “basting” most unmercifully—“very gratifying indeed, to see how\ncompletely Mrs Jamieson feels at home in my poor little dwelling; she\ncould not have paid me a greater compliment.”Miss Barker provided me with some literature in the shape of three or\nfour handsomely-bound fashion-books ten or twelve years old, observing,\nas she put a little table and a candle for my especial benefit, that she\nknew young people liked to look at pictures.  Carlo lay and snorted, and\nstarted at his mistress’s feet.  He, too, was quite at home.The card-table was an animated scene to watch; four ladies’ heads, with\nniddle-noddling caps, all nearly meeting over the middle of the table in\ntheir eagerness to whisper quick enough and loud enough: and every now\nand then came Miss Barker’s “Hush, ladies! if you please, hush!  Mrs\nJamieson is asleep.”It was very difficult to steer clear between Mrs Forrester’s deafness\nand Mrs Jamieson’s sleepiness.  But Miss Barker managed her arduous task\nwell.  She repeated the whisper to Mrs Forrester, distorting her face\nconsiderably, in order to show, by the motions of her lips, what was\nsaid; and then she smiled kindly all round at us, and murmured to\nherself, “Very gratifying, indeed; I wish my poor sister had been alive\nto see this day.”"

  "content": "Presently the door was thrown wide open; Carlo started to his feet, with\na loud snapping bark, and Mrs Jamieson awoke: or, perhaps, she had not\nbeen asleep—as she said almost directly, the room had been so light she\nhad been glad to keep her eyes shut, but had been listening with great\ninterest to all our amusing and agreeable conversation.  Peggy came in\nonce more, red with importance.  Another tray!  “Oh, gentility!” thought\nI, “can you endure this last shock?”  For Miss Barker had ordered (nay,\nI doubt not, prepared, although she did say, “Why, Peggy, what have you\nbrought us?” and looked pleasantly surprised at the unexpected pleasure)\nall sorts of good things for supper—scalloped oysters, potted lobsters,\njelly, a dish called “little Cupids” (which was in great favour with the\nCranford ladies, although too expensive to be given, except on solemn\nand state occasions—macaroons sopped in brandy, I should have called it,\nif I had not known its more refined and classical name).  In short, we\nwere evidently to be feasted with all that was sweetest and best; and\nwe thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our\ngentility—which never ate suppers in general, but which, like most\nnon-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.Miss Barker, in her former sphere, had, I daresay, been made acquainted\nwith the beverage they call cherry-brandy.  We none of us had ever seen\nsuch a thing, and rather shrank back when she proffered it us—“just a\nlittle, leetle glass, ladies; after the oysters and lobsters, you know.\nShell-fish are sometimes thought not very wholesome.”  We all shook our\nheads like female mandarins; but, at last, Mrs Jamieson suffered herself\nto be persuaded, and we followed her lead.  It was not exactly\nunpalatable, though so hot and so strong that we thought ourselves bound\nto give evidence that we were not accustomed to such things by coughing\nterribly—almost as strangely as Miss Barker had done, before we were\nadmitted by Peggy.“It’s very strong,” said Miss Pole, as she put down her empty glass; “I\ndo believe there’s spirit in it.”“Only a little drop—just necessary to make it keep,” said Miss Barker.\n“You know we put brandy-pepper over our preserves to make them keep.  I\noften feel tipsy myself from eating damson tart.”I question whether damson tart would have opened Mrs Jamieson’s heart as\nthe cherry-brandy did; but she told us of a coming event, respecting\nwhich she had been quite silent till that moment.“My sister-in-law, Lady Glenmire, is coming to stay with me.”There was a chorus of “Indeed!” and then a pause.  Each one rapidly\nreviewed her wardrobe, as to its fitness to appear in the presence of a\nbaron’s widow; for, of course, a series of small festivals were always\nheld in Cranford on the arrival of a visitor at any of our friends’\nhouses.  We felt very pleasantly excited on the present occasion."

  "content": "Not long after this the maids and the lanterns were announced.  Mrs\nJamieson had the sedan-chair, which had squeezed itself into Miss\nBarker’s narrow lobby with some difficulty, and most literally “stopped\nthe way.”  It required some skilful manoeuvring on the part of the old\nchairmen (shoemakers by day, but when summoned to carry the sedan\ndressed up in a strange old livery—long great-coats, with small capes,\ncoeval with the sedan, and similar to the dress of the class in\nHogarth’s pictures) to edge, and back, and try at it again, and finally\nto succeed in carrying their burden out of Miss Barker’s front door.\nThen we heard their quick pit-a-pat along the quiet little street as we\nput on our calashes and pinned up our gowns; Miss Barker hovering about\nus with offers of help, which, if she had not remembered her former\noccupation, and wished us to forget it, would have been much more\npressing.CHAPTER VIII.\n“YOUR LADYSHIP”EARLY the next morning—directly after twelve—Miss Pole made her\nappearance at Miss Matty’s.  Some very trifling piece of business was\nalleged as a reason for the call; but there was evidently something\nbehind.  At last out it came.“By the way, you’ll think I’m strangely ignorant; but, do you really\nknow, I am puzzled how we ought to address Lady Glenmire.  Do you say,\n‘Your Ladyship,’ where you would say ‘you’ to a common person?  I have\nbeen puzzling all morning; and are we to say ‘My Lady,’ instead of\n‘Ma’am?’  Now you knew Lady Arley—will you kindly tell me the most\ncorrect way of speaking to the peerage?”Poor Miss Matty! she took off her spectacles and she put them on\nagain—but how Lady Arley was addressed, she could not remember.“It is so long ago,” she said.  “Dear! dear! how stupid I am!  I don’t\nthink I ever saw her more than twice.  I know we used to call Sir Peter,\n‘Sir Peter’—but he came much oftener to see us than Lady Arley did.\nDeborah would have known in a minute.  ‘My lady’—‘your ladyship.’  It\nsounds very strange, and as if it was not natural.  I never thought of\nit before; but, now you have named it, I am all in a puzzle.”It was very certain Miss Pole would obtain no wise decision from Miss\nMatty, who got more bewildered every moment, and more perplexed as to\netiquettes of address.“Well, I really think,” said Miss Pole, “I had better just go and tell\nMrs Forrester about our little difficulty.  One sometimes grows nervous;\nand yet one would not have Lady Glenmire think we were quite ignorant of\nthe etiquettes of high life in Cranford.”“And will you just step in here, dear Miss Pole, as you come back,\nplease, and tell me what you decide upon?  Whatever you and Mrs\nForrester fix upon, will be quite right, I’m sure.  ‘Lady Arley,’ ‘Sir\nPeter,’” said Miss Matty to herself, trying to recall the old forms of\nwords.“Who is Lady Glenmire?” asked I."

  "content": "“Oh, she’s the widow of Mr Jamieson—that’s Mrs Jamieson’s late husband,\nyou know—widow of his eldest brother.  Mrs Jamieson was a Miss Walker,\ndaughter of Governor Walker.  ‘Your ladyship.’  My dear, if they fix on\nthat way of speaking, you must just let me practice a little on you\nfirst, for I shall feel so foolish and hot saying it the first time to\nLady Glenmire.”It was really a relief to Miss Matty when Mrs Jamieson came on a very\nunpolite errand.  I notice that apathetic people have more quiet\nimpertinence than others; and Mrs Jamieson came now to insinuate pretty\nplainly that she did not particularly wish that the Cranford ladies\nshould call upon her sister-in-law.  I can hardly say how she made this\nclear; for I grew very indignant and warm, while with slow deliberation\nshe was explaining her wishes to Miss Matty, who, a true lady herself,\ncould hardly understand the feeling which made Mrs Jamieson wish to\nappear to her noble sister-in-law as if she only visited “county”\nfamilies.  Miss Matty remained puzzled and perplexed long after I had\nfound out the object of Mrs Jamieson’s visit.When she did understand the drift of the honourable lady’s call, it was\npretty to see with what quiet dignity she received the intimation thus\nuncourteously given.  She was not in the least hurt—she was of too\ngentle a spirit for that; nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving\nof Mrs Jamieson’s conduct; but there was something of this feeling in\nher mind, I am sure, which made her pass from the subject to others in a\nless flurried and more composed manner than usual.  Mrs Jamieson was,\nindeed, the more flurried of the two, and I could see she was glad to\ntake her leave."

  "content": "A little while afterwards Miss Pole returned, red and indignant.  “Well!\nto be sure!  You’ve had Mrs Jamieson here, I find from Martha; and we\nare not to call on Lady Glenmire.  Yes!  I met Mrs Jamieson, half-way\nbetween here and Mrs Forrester’s, and she told me; she took me so by\nsurprise, I had nothing to say.  I wish I had thought of something very\nsharp and sarcastic; I dare say I shall to-night.  And Lady Glenmire is\nbut the widow of a Scotch baron after all!  I went on to look at Mrs\nForrester’s Peerage, to see who this lady was, that is to be kept under\na glass case: widow of a Scotch peer—never sat in the House of Lords—and\nas poor as Job, I dare say; and she—fifth daughter of some Mr Campbell\nor other. You are the daughter of a rector, at any rate, and related to\nthe Arleys; and Sir Peter might have been Viscount Arley, every one\nsays.”Miss Matty tried to soothe Miss Pole, but in vain.  That lady, usually\nso kind and good-humoured, was now in a full flow of anger.“And I went and ordered a cap this morning, to be quite ready,” said she\nat last, letting out the secret which gave sting to Mrs Jamieson’s\nintimation.  “Mrs Jamieson shall see if it is so easy to get me to make\nfourth at a pool when she has none of her fine Scotch relations with\nher!”In coming out of church, the first Sunday on which Lady Glenmire\nappeared in Cranford, we sedulously talked together, and turned our\nbacks on Mrs Jamieson and her guest.  If we might not call on her, we\nwould not even look at her, though we were dying with curiosity to know\nwhat she was like.  We had the comfort of questioning Martha in the\nafternoon.  Martha did not belong to a sphere of society whose\nobservation could be an implied compliment to Lady Glenmire, and Martha\nhad made good use of her eyes.“Well, ma’am! is it the little lady with Mrs Jamieson, you mean?  I\nthought you would like more to know how young Mrs Smith was dressed; her\nbeing a bride.”  (Mrs Smith was the butcher’s wife).Miss Pole said, “Good gracious me! as if we cared about a Mrs Smith;”\nbut was silent as Martha resumed her speech.“The little lady in Mrs Jamieson’s pew had on, ma’am, rather an old\nblack silk, and a shepherd’s plaid cloak, ma’am, and very bright black\neyes she had, ma’am, and a pleasant, sharp face; not over young, ma’am,\nbut yet, I should guess, younger than Mrs Jamieson herself.  She looked\nup and down the church, like a bird, and nipped up her petticoats, when\nshe came out, as quick and sharp as ever I see.  I’ll tell you what,\nma’am, she’s more like Mrs Deacon, at the ‘Coach and Horses,’ nor any\none.”“Hush, Martha!” said Miss Matty, “that’s not respectful.”“Isn’t it, ma’am?  I beg pardon, I’m sure; but Jem Hearn said so as\nwell. He said, she was just such a sharp, stirring sort of a body”—“Lady,” said Miss Pole.“Lady—as Mrs Deacon.”"

  "content": "Another Sunday passed away, and we still averted our eyes from Mrs\nJamieson and her guest, and made remarks to ourselves that we thought\nwere very severe—almost too much so.  Miss Matty was evidently uneasy at\nour sarcastic manner of speaking.Perhaps by this time Lady Glenmire had found out that Mrs Jamieson’s was\nnot the gayest, liveliest house in the world; perhaps Mrs Jamieson had\nfound out that most of the county families were in London, and that\nthose who remained in the country were not so alive as they might have\nbeen to the circumstance of Lady Glenmire being in their neighbourhood.\nGreat events spring out of small causes; so I will not pretend to say\nwhat induced Mrs Jamieson to alter her determination of excluding the\nCranford ladies, and send notes of invitation all round for a small\nparty on the following Tuesday.  Mr Mulliner himself brought them round.\n He _would_ always ignore the fact of there being a back door to any\nhouse, and gave a louder rat-tat than his mistress, Mrs Jamieson.  He\nhad three little notes, which he carried in a large basket, in order to\nimpress his mistress with an idea of their great weight, though they\nmight easily have gone into his waistcoat pocket.Miss Matty and I quietly decided that we would have a previous\nengagement at home: it was the evening on which Miss Matty usually made\ncandle-lighters of all the notes and letters of the week; for on Mondays\nher accounts were always made straight—not a penny owing from the week\nbefore; so, by a natural arrangement, making candle-lighters fell upon a\nTuesday evening, and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining Mrs\nJamieson’s invitation.  But before our answer was written, in came Miss\nPole, with an open note in her hand.“So!” she said.  “Ah!  I see you have got your note, too.  Better late\nthan never.  I could have told my Lady Glenmire she would be glad enough\nof our society before a fortnight was over.”"

  "content": "“Yes,” said Miss Matty, “we’re asked for Tuesday evening.  And perhaps\nyou would just kindly bring your work across and drink tea with us that\nnight.  It is my usual regular time for looking over the last week’s\nbills, and notes, and letters, and making candle-lighters of them; but\nthat does not seem quite reason enough for saying I have a previous\nengagement at home, though I meant to make it do.  Now, if you would\ncome, my conscience would be quite at ease, and luckily the note is not\nwritten yet.”I saw Miss Pole’s countenance change while Miss Matty was speaking.“Don’t you mean to go then?” asked she.“Oh, no!” said, Miss Matty quietly.  “You don’t either, I suppose?”“I don’t know,” replied Miss Pole.  “Yes, I think I do,” said she,\nrather briskly; and on seeing Miss Matty look surprised, she added, “You\nsee, one would not like Mrs Jamieson to think that anything she could\ndo, or say, was of consequence enough to give offence; it would be a\nkind of letting down of ourselves, that I, for one, should not like.  It\nwould be too flattering to Mrs Jamieson if we allowed her to suppose\nthat what she had said affected us a week, nay ten days afterwards.”“Well!  I suppose it is wrong to be hurt and annoyed so long about\nanything; and, perhaps, after all, she did not mean to vex us.  But I\nmust say, I could not have brought myself to say the things Mrs Jamieson\ndid about our not calling.  I really don’t think I shall go.”“Oh, come!  Miss Matty, you must go; you know our friend Mrs Jamieson is\nmuch more phlegmatic than most people, and does not enter into the\nlittle delicacies of feeling which you possess in so remarkable a\ndegree.”“I thought you possessed them, too, that day Mrs Jamieson called to tell\nus not to go,” said Miss Matty innocently.But Miss Pole, in addition to her delicacies of feeling, possessed a\nvery smart cap, which she was anxious to show to an admiring world; and\nso she seemed to forget all her angry words uttered not a fortnight\nbefore, and to be ready to act on what she called the great Christian\nprinciple of “Forgive and forget”; and she lectured dear Miss Matty so\nlong on this head that she absolutely ended by assuring her it was her\nduty, as a deceased rector’s daughter, to buy a new cap and go to the\nparty at Mrs Jamieson’s.  So “we were most happy to accept,” instead of\n“regretting that we were obliged to decline.”[Picture: Mr Mulliner]"

  "content": "The expenditure on dress in Cranford was principally in that one article\nreferred to.  If the heads were buried in smart new caps, the ladies\nwere like ostriches, and cared not what became of their bodies.  Old\ngowns, white and venerable collars, any number of brooches, up and down\nand everywhere (some with dogs’ eyes painted in them; some that were\nlike small picture-frames with mausoleums and weeping-willows neatly\nexecuted in hair inside; some, again, with miniatures of ladies and\ngentlemen sweetly smiling out of a nest of stiff muslin), old brooches\nfor a permanent ornament, and new caps to suit the fashion of the\nday—the ladies of Cranford always dressed with chaste elegance and\npropriety, as Miss Barker once prettily expressed it.And with three new caps, and a greater array of brooches than had ever\nbeen seen together at one time since Cranford was a town, did Mrs\nForrester, and Miss Matty, and Miss Pole appear on that memorable\nTuesday evening.  I counted seven brooches myself on Miss Pole’s dress.\nTwo were fixed negligently in her cap (one was a butterfly made of\nScotch pebbles, which a vivid imagination might believe to be the real\ninsect); one fastened her net neckerchief; one her collar; one\nornamented the front of her gown, midway between her throat and waist;\nand another adorned the point of her stomacher.  Where the seventh was I\nhave forgotten, but it was somewhere about her, I am sure."

  "content": "But I am getting on too fast, in describing the dresses of the company.\nI should first relate the gathering on the way to Mrs Jamieson’s.  That\nlady lived in a large house just outside the town.  A road which had\nknown what it was to be a street ran right before the house, which\nopened out upon it without any intervening garden or court.  Whatever\nthe sun was about, he never shone on the front of that house.  To be\nsure, the living-rooms were at the back, looking on to a pleasant\ngarden; the front windows only belonged to kitchens and housekeepers’\nrooms, and pantries, and in one of them Mr Mulliner was reported to sit.\n Indeed, looking askance, we often saw the back of a head covered with\nhair powder, which also extended itself over his coat-collar down to his\nvery waist; and this imposing back was always engaged in reading the _St\nJames’s Chronicle_, opened wide, which, in some degree, accounted for\nthe length of time the said newspaper was in reaching us—equal\nsubscribers with Mrs Jamieson, though, in right of her honourableness,\nshe always had the reading of it first.  This very Tuesday, the delay in\nforwarding the last number had been particularly aggravating; just when\nboth Miss Pole and Miss Matty, the former more especially, had been\nwanting to see it, in order to coach up the Court news ready for the\nevening’s interview with aristocracy.  Miss Pole told us she had\nabsolutely taken time by the forelock, and been dressed by five o’clock,\nin order to be ready if the _St James’s Chronicle_ should come in at the\nlast moment—the very _St James’s Chronicle_ which the powdered head was\ntranquilly and composedly reading as we passed the accustomed window\nthis evening.“The impudence of the man!” said Miss Pole, in a low indignant whisper.\n“I should like to ask him whether his mistress pays her quarter-share\nfor his exclusive use.”We looked at her in admiration of the courage of her thought; for Mr\nMulliner was an object of great awe to all of us.  He seemed never to\nhave forgotten his condescension in coming to live at Cranford.  Miss\nJenkyns, at times, had stood forth as the undaunted champion of her sex,\nand spoken to him on terms of equality; but even Miss Jenkyns could get\nno higher.  In his pleasantest and most gracious moods he looked like a\nsulky cockatoo.  He did not speak except in gruff monosyllables.  He\nwould wait in the hall when we begged him not to wait, and then look\ndeeply offended because we had kept him there, while, with trembling,\nhasty hands we prepared ourselves for appearing in company.Miss Pole ventured on a small joke as we went upstairs, intended, though\naddressed to us, to afford Mr Mulliner some slight amusement.  We all\nsmiled, in order to seem as if we felt at our ease, and timidly looked\nfor Mr Mulliner’s sympathy.  Not a muscle of that wooden face had\nrelaxed; and we were grave in an instant."

  "content": "Mrs Jamieson’s drawing-room was cheerful; the evening sun came streaming\ninto it, and the large square window was clustered round with flowers.\nThe furniture was white and gold; not the later style, Louis Quatorze, I\nthink they call it, all shells and twirls; no, Mrs Jamieson’s chairs and\ntables had not a curve or bend about them.  The chair and table legs\ndiminished as they neared the ground, and were straight and square in\nall their corners.  The chairs were all a-row against the walls, with\nthe exception of four or five which stood in a circle round the fire.\nThey were railed with white bars across the back and knobbed with gold;\nneither the railings nor the knobs invited to ease.  There was a\njapanned table devoted to literature, on which lay a Bible, a Peerage,\nand a Prayer-Book.  There was another square Pembroke table dedicated to\nthe Fine Arts, on which were a kaleidoscope, conversation-cards,\npuzzle-cards (tied together to an interminable length with faded pink\nsatin ribbon), and a box painted in fond imitation of the drawings which\ndecorate tea-chests.  Carlo lay on the worsted-worked rug, and\nungraciously barked at us as we entered.  Mrs Jamieson stood up, giving\nus each a torpid smile of welcome, and looking helplessly beyond us at\nMr Mulliner, as if she hoped he would place us in chairs, for, if he did\nnot, she never could.  I suppose he thought we could find our way to the\ncircle round the fire, which reminded me of Stonehenge, I don’t know\nwhy.  Lady Glenmire came to the rescue of our hostess, and, somehow or\nother, we found ourselves for the first time placed agreeably, and not\nformally, in Mrs Jamieson’s house.  Lady Glenmire, now we had time to\nlook at her, proved to be a bright little woman of middle age, who had\nbeen very pretty in the days of her youth, and who was even yet very\npleasant-looking.  I saw Miss Pole appraising her dress in the first\nfive minutes, and I take her word when she said the next day—“My dear! ten pounds would have purchased every stitch she had on—lace\nand all.”It was pleasant to suspect that a peeress could be poor, and partly\nreconciled us to the fact that her husband had never sat in the House of\nLords; which, when we first heard of it, seemed a kind of swindling us\nout of our prospects on false pretences; a sort of “A Lord and No Lord”\nbusiness.We were all very silent at first.  We were thinking what we could talk\nabout, that should be high enough to interest My Lady.  There had been a\nrise in the price of sugar, which, as preserving-time was near, was a\npiece of intelligence to all our house-keeping hearts, and would have\nbeen the natural topic if Lady Glenmire had not been by.  But we were\nnot sure if the peerage ate preserves—much less knew how they were made.\n At last, Miss Pole, who had always a great deal of courage and _savoir\nfaire_, spoke to Lady Glenmire, who on her part had seemed just as much\npuzzled to know how to break the silence as we were.“Has your ladyship been to Court lately?” asked she; and then gave a\nlittle glance round at us, half timid and half triumphant, as much as to\nsay, “See how judiciously I have chosen a subject befitting the rank of\nthe stranger.”“I never was there in my life,” said Lady Glenmire, with a broad Scotch\naccent, but in a very sweet voice.  And then, as if she had been too\nabrupt, she added: “We very seldom went to London—only twice, in fact,\nduring all my married life; and before I was married my father had far\ntoo large a family” (fifth daughter of Mr Campbell was in all our minds,\nI am sure) “to take us often from our home, even to Edinburgh.  Ye’ll\nhave been in Edinburgh, maybe?” said she, suddenly brightening up with\nthe hope of a common interest.  We had none of us been there; but Miss\nPole had an uncle who once had passed a night there, which was very\npleasant."

  "content": "Mrs Jamieson, meanwhile, was absorbed in wonder why Mr Mulliner did not\nbring the tea; and at length the wonder oozed out of her mouth.“I had better ring the bell, my dear, had not I?” said Lady Glenmire\nbriskly.“No—I think not—Mulliner does not like to be hurried.”We should have liked our tea, for we dined at an earlier hour than Mrs\nJamieson.  I suspect Mr Mulliner had to finish the _St James’s\nChronicle_ before he chose to trouble himself about tea.  His mistress\nfidgeted and fidgeted, and kept saying, “I can’t think why Mulliner does\nnot bring tea.  I can’t think what he can be about.”  And Lady Glenmire\nat last grew quite impatient, but it was a pretty kind of impatience\nafter all; and she rang the bell rather sharply, on receiving a\nhalf-permission from her sister-in-law to do so.  Mr Mulliner appeared\nin dignified surprise. “Oh!” said Mrs Jamieson, “Lady Glenmire rang the\nbell; I believe it was for tea.”"

  "content": "In a few minutes tea was brought.  Very delicate was the china, very old\nthe plate, very thin the bread and butter, and very small the lumps of\nsugar.  Sugar was evidently Mrs Jamieson’s favourite economy.  I\nquestion if the little filigree sugar-tongs, made something like\nscissors, could have opened themselves wide enough to take up an honest,\nvulgar good-sized piece; and when I tried to seize two little minnikin\npieces at once, so as not to be detected in too many returns to the\nsugar-basin, they absolutely dropped one, with a little sharp clatter,\nquite in a malicious and unnatural manner.  But before this happened we\nhad had a slight disappointment.  In the little silver jug was cream, in\nthe larger one was milk.  As soon as Mr Mulliner came in, Carlo began to\nbeg, which was a thing our manners forbade us to do, though I am sure we\nwere just as hungry; and Mrs Jamieson said she was certain we would\nexcuse her if she gave her poor dumb Carlo his tea first.  She\naccordingly mixed a saucerful for him, and put it down for him to lap;\nand then she told us how intelligent and sensible the dear little fellow\nwas; he knew cream quite well, and constantly refused tea with only milk\nin it: so the milk was left for us; but we silently thought we were\nquite as intelligent and sensible as Carlo, and felt as if insult were\nadded to injury when we were called upon to admire the gratitude evinced\nby his wagging his tail for the cream which should have been ours.After tea we thawed down into common-life subjects.  We were thankful to\nLady Glenmire for having proposed some more bread and butter, and this\nmutual want made us better acquainted with her than we should ever have\nbeen with talking about the Court, though Miss Pole did say she had\nhoped to know how the dear Queen was from some one who had seen her.The friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to cards.  Lady\nGlenmire played Preference to admiration, and was a complete authority\nas to Ombre and Quadrille.  Even Miss Pole quite forgot to say “my\nlady,” and “your ladyship,” and said “Basto! ma’am”; “you have Spadille,\nI believe,” just as quietly as if we had never held the great Cranford\nParliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a peeress.As a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in the\npresence of one who might have sat down to tea with a coronet, instead\nof a cap, on her head, Mrs Forrester related a curious little fact to\nLady Glenmire—an anecdote known to the circle of her intimate friends,\nbut of which even Mrs Jamieson was not aware.  It related to some fine\nold lace, the sole relic of better days, which Lady Glenmire was\nadmiring on Mrs Forrester’s collar."

  "content": "“Yes,” said that lady, “such lace cannot be got now for either love or\nmoney; made by the nuns abroad, they tell me.  They say that they can’t\nmake it now even there.  But perhaps they can, now they’ve passed the\nCatholic Emancipation Bill.  I should not wonder.  But, in the meantime,\nI treasure up my lace very much.  I daren’t even trust the washing of it\nto my maid” (the little charity school-girl I have named before, but who\nsounded well as “my maid”).  “I always wash it myself.  And once it had\na narrow escape.  Of course, your ladyship knows that such lace must\nnever be starched or ironed.  Some people wash it in sugar and water,\nand some in coffee, to make it the right yellow colour; but I myself\nhave a very good receipt for washing it in milk, which stiffens it\nenough, and gives it a very good creamy colour.  Well, ma’am, I had\ntacked it together (and the beauty of this fine lace is that, when it is\nwet, it goes into a very little space), and put it to soak in milk,\nwhen, unfortunately, I left the room; on my return, I found pussy on the\ntable, looking very like a thief, but gulping very uncomfortably, as if\nshe was half-chocked with something she wanted to swallow and could not.\n And, would you believe it?  At first I pitied her, and said ‘Poor\npussy! poor pussy!’ till, all at once, I looked and saw the cup of milk\nempty—cleaned out!  ‘You naughty cat!’ said I, and I believe I was\nprovoked enough to give her a slap, which did no good, but only helped\nthe lace down—just as one slaps a choking child on the back.  I could\nhave cried, I was so vexed; but I determined I would not give the lace\nup without a struggle for it.  I hoped the lace might disagree with her,\nat any rate; but it would have been too much for Job, if he had seen, as\nI did, that cat come in, quite placid and purring, not a quarter of an\nhour after, and almost expecting to be stroked.  ‘No, pussy!’ said I,\n‘if you have any conscience you ought not to expect that!’  And then a\nthought struck me; and I rang the bell for my maid, and sent her to Mr\nHoggins, with my compliments, and would he be kind enough to lend me one\nof his top-boots for an hour?  I did not think there was anything odd in\nthe message; but Jenny said the young men in the surgery laughed as if\nthey would be ill at my wanting a top-boot.  When it came, Jenny and I\nput pussy in, with her forefeet straight down, so that they were\nfastened, and could not scratch, and we gave her a teaspoonful of\ncurrent-jelly in which (your ladyship must excuse me) I had mixed some\ntartar emetic.  I shall never forget how anxious I was for the next\nhalf-hour.  I took pussy to my own room, and spread a clean towel on the\nfloor.  I could have kissed her when she returned the lace to sight,\nvery much as it had gone down.  Jenny had boiling water ready, and we\nsoaked it and soaked it, and spread it on a lavender-bush in the sun\nbefore I could touch it again, even to put it in milk.  But now your\nladyship would never guess that it had been in pussy’s inside.”"

  "content": "[Picture: We gave her a teaspoonful of current-jelly]We found out, in the course of the evening, that Lady Glenmire was going\nto pay Mrs Jamieson a long visit, as she had given up her apartments in\nEdinburgh, and had no ties to take her back there in a hurry.  On the\nwhole, we were rather glad to hear this, for she had made a pleasant\nimpression upon us; and it was also very comfortable to find, from\nthings which dropped out in the course of conversation, that, in\naddition to many other genteel qualities, she was far removed from the\n“vulgarity of wealth.”“Don’t you find it very unpleasant walking?” asked Mrs Jamieson, as our\nrespective servants were announced.  It was a pretty regular question\nfrom Mrs Jamieson, who had her own carriage in the coach-house, and\nalways went out in a sedan-chair to the very shortest distances.  The\nanswers were nearly as much a matter of course.“Oh dear, no! it is so pleasant and still at night!”  “Such a\nrefreshment after the excitement of a party!”  “The stars are so\nbeautiful!”  This last was from Miss Matty.“Are you fond of astronomy?” Lady Glenmire asked.“Not very,” replied Miss Matty, rather confused at the moment to\nremember which was astronomy and which was astrology—but the answer was\ntrue under either circumstance, for she read, and was slightly alarmed\nat Francis Moore’s astrological predictions; and, as to astronomy, in a\nprivate and confidential conversation, she had told me she never could\nbelieve that the earth was moving constantly, and that she would not\nbelieve it if she could, it made her feel so tired and dizzy whenever\nshe thought about it.In our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that night, so\nrefined and delicate were our perceptions after drinking tea with “my\nlady.”CHAPTER IX.\nSIGNOR BRUNONI"

  "content": "SOON after the events of which I gave an account in my last paper, I was\nsummoned home by my father’s illness; and for a time I forgot, in\nanxiety about him, to wonder how my dear friends at Cranford were\ngetting on, or how Lady Glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness\nof the long visit which she was still paying to her sister-in-law, Mrs\nJamieson. When my father grew a little stronger I accompanied him to the\nseaside, so that altogether I seemed banished from Cranford, and was\ndeprived of the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the\ndear little town for the greater part of that year.Late in November—when we had returned home again, and my father was once\nmore in good health—I received a letter from Miss Matty; and a very\nmysterious letter it was.  She began many sentences without ending them,\nrunning them one into another, in much the same confused sort of way in\nwhich written words run together on blotting-paper.  All I could make\nout was that, if my father was better (which she hoped he was), and\nwould take warning and wear a great-coat from Michaelmas to Lady-day, if\nturbans were in fashion, could I tell her?  Such a piece of gaiety was\ngoing to happen as had not been seen or known of since Wombwell’s lions\ncame, when one of them ate a little child’s arm; and she was, perhaps,\ntoo old to care about dress, but a new cap she must have; and, having\nheard that turbans were worn, and some of the county families likely to\ncome, she would like to look tidy, if I would bring her a cap from the\nmilliner I employed; and oh, dear! how careless of her to forget that\nshe wrote to beg I would come and pay her a visit next Tuesday; when she\nhoped to have something to offer me in the way of amusement, which she\nwould not now more particularly describe, only sea-green was her\nfavourite colour.  So she ended her letter; but in a P.S. she added, she\nthought she might as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to\nCranford just now; Signor Brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful\nmagic in the Cranford Assembly Rooms on Wednesday and Friday evening in\nthe following week."

It was in vain\nthat I twirled the cap round on my hand to exhibit back and side fronts:\nher heart had been set upon a turban, and all she could do was to say,\nwith resignation in her look and voice—“I am sure you did your best, my dear.  It is just like the caps all the\nladies in Cranford are wearing, and they have had theirs for a year, I\ndare say.  I should have liked something newer, I confess—something more\nlike the turbans Miss Betty Barker tells me Queen Adelaide wears; but it\nis very pretty, my dear.  And I dare say lavender will wear better than\nsea-green.  Well, after all, what is dress, that we should care anything\nabout it?  You’ll tell me if you want anything, my dear.  Here is the\nbell.  I suppose turbans have not got down to Drumble yet?”So saying, the dear old lady gently bemoaned herself out of the room,\nleaving me to dress for the evening, when, as she informed me, she\nexpected Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester, and she hoped I should not feel\nmyself too much tired to join the party.  Of course I should not; and I\nmade some haste to unpack and arrange my dress; but, with all my speed,\nI heard the arrivals and the buzz of conversation in the next room\nbefore I was ready.  Just as I opened the door, I caught the words, “I\nwas foolish to expect anything very genteel out of the Drumble shops;\npoor girl! she did her best, I’ve no doubt.”  But, for all that, I had\nrather that she blamed Drumble and me than disfigured herself with a\nturban."
