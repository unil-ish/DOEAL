  "content": "One night, I remember this candle economy particularly annoyed me.  I\nhad been very much tired of my compulsory “blind man’s holiday,”\nespecially as Miss Matty had fallen asleep, and I did not like to stir\nthe fire and run the risk of awakening her; so I could not even sit on\nthe rug, and scorch myself with sewing by firelight, according to my\nusual custom.  I fancied Miss Matty must be dreaming of her early life;\nfor she spoke one or two words in her uneasy sleep bearing reference to\npersons who were dead long before.  When Martha brought in the lighted\ncandle and tea, Miss Matty started into wakefulness, with a strange,\nbewildered look around, as if we were not the people she expected to see\nabout her. There was a little sad expression that shadowed her face as\nshe recognised me; but immediately afterwards she tried to give me her\nusual smile.  All through tea-time her talk ran upon the days of her\nchildhood and youth.  Perhaps this reminded her of the desirableness of\nlooking over all the old family letters, and destroying such as ought\nnot to be allowed to fall into the hands of strangers; for she had often\nspoken of the necessity of this task, but had always shrunk from it,\nwith a timid dread of something painful.  To-night, however, she rose up\nafter tea and went for them—in the dark; for she piqued herself on the\nprecise neatness of all her chamber arrangements, and used to look\nuneasily at me when I lighted a bed-candle to go to another room for\nanything.  When she returned there was a faint, pleasant smell of\nTonquin beans in the room. I had always noticed this scent about any of\nthe things which had belonged to her mother; and many of the letters\nwere addressed to her—yellow bundles of love-letters, sixty or seventy\nyears old.Miss Matty undid the packet with a sigh; but she stifled it directly, as\nif it were hardly right to regret the flight of time, or of life either.\nWe agreed to look them over separately, each taking a different letter\nout of the same bundle and describing its contents to the other before\ndestroying it.  I never knew what sad work the reading of old letters\nwas before that evening, though I could hardly tell why.  The letters\nwere as happy as letters could be—at least those early letters were.\nThere was in them a vivid and intense sense of the present time, which\nseemed so strong and full, as if it could never pass away, and as if the\nwarm, living hearts that so expressed themselves could never die, and be\nas nothing to the sunny earth.  I should have felt less melancholy, I\nbelieve, if the letters had been more so.  I saw the tears stealing down\nthe well-worn furrows of Miss Matty’s cheeks, and her spectacles often\nwanted wiping.  I trusted at last that she would light the other candle,\nfor my own eyes were rather dim, and I wanted more light to see the\npale, faded ink; but no, even through her tears, she saw and remembered\nher little economical ways."

  "content": "The earliest set of letters were two bundles tied together, and ticketed\n(in Miss Jenkyns’s handwriting) “Letters interchanged between my\never-honoured father and my dearly-beloved mother, prior to their\nmarriage, in July 1774.”  I should guess that the rector of Cranford was\nabout twenty-seven years of age when he wrote those letters; and Miss\nMatty told me that her mother was just eighteen at the time of her\nwedding.  With my idea of the rector derived from a picture in the\ndining-parlour, stiff and stately, in a huge full-bottomed wig, with\ngown, cassock, and bands, and his hand upon a copy of the only sermon he\never published—it was strange to read these letters.  They were full of\neager, passionate ardour; short homely sentences, right fresh from the\nheart (very different from the grand Latinised, Johnsonian style of the\nprinted sermon preached before some judge at assize time).  His letters\nwere a curious contrast to those of his girl-bride.  She was evidently\nrather annoyed at his demands upon her for expressions of love, and\ncould not quite understand what he meant by repeating the same thing\nover in so many different ways; but what she was quite clear about was a\nlonging for a white “Paduasoy”—whatever that might be; and six or seven\nletters were principally occupied in asking her lover to use his\ninfluence with her parents (who evidently kept her in good order) to\nobtain this or that article of dress, more especially the white\n“Paduasoy.”  He cared nothing how she was dressed; she was always lovely\nenough for him, as he took pains to assure her, when she begged him to\nexpress in his answers a predilection for particular pieces of finery,\nin order that she might show what he said to her parents.  But at length\nhe seemed to find out that she would not be married till she had a\n“trousseau” to her mind; and then he sent her a letter, which had\nevidently accompanied a whole box full of finery, and in which he\nrequested that she might be dressed in everything her heart desired.\nThis was the first letter, ticketed in a frail, delicate hand, “From my\ndearest John.”  Shortly afterwards they were married, I suppose, from\nthe intermission in their correspondence."

  "content": "“We must burn them, I think,” said Miss Matty, looking doubtfully at me.\n“No one will care for them when I am gone.”  And one by one she dropped\nthem into the middle of the fire, watching each blaze up, die out, and\nrise away, in faint, white, ghostly semblance, up the chimney, before\nshe gave another to the same fate.  The room was light enough now; but\nI, like her, was fascinated into watching the destruction of those\nletters, into which the honest warmth of a manly heart had been poured\nforth.The next letter, likewise docketed by Miss Jenkyns, was endorsed,\n“Letter of pious congratulation and exhortation from my venerable\ngrandfather to my beloved mother, on occasion of my own birth.  Also\nsome practical remarks on the desirability of keeping warm the\nextremities of infants, from my excellent grandmother.”The first part was, indeed, a severe and forcible picture of the\nresponsibilities of mothers, and a warning against the evils that were\nin the world, and lying in ghastly wait for the little baby of two days\nold. His wife did not write, said the old gentleman, because he had\nforbidden it, she being indisposed with a sprained ankle, which (he\nsaid) quite incapacitated her from holding a pen.  However, at the foot\nof the page was a small “T.O.,” and on turning it over, sure enough,\nthere was a letter to “my dear, dearest Molly,” begging her, when she\nleft her room, whatever she did, to go _up_ stairs before going _down_:\nand telling her to wrap her baby’s feet up in flannel, and keep it warm\nby the fire, although it was summer, for babies were so tender."

  "content": "It was pretty to see from the letters, which were evidently exchanged\nwith some frequency between the young mother and the grandmother, how\nthe girlish vanity was being weeded out of her heart by love for her\nbaby. The white “Paduasoy” figured again in the letters, with almost as\nmuch vigour as before.  In one, it was being made into a christening\ncloak for the baby.  It decked it when it went with its parents to\nspend a day or two at Arley Hall.  It added to its charms, when it was\n“the prettiest little baby that ever was seen.  Dear mother, I wish you\ncould see her! Without any pershality, I do think she will grow up a\nregular bewty!”  I thought of Miss Jenkyns, grey, withered, and\nwrinkled, and I wondered if her mother had known her in the courts of\nheaven: and then I knew that she had, and that they stood there in\nangelic guise.There was a great gap before any of the rector’s letters appeared.  And\nthen his wife had changed her mode of her endorsement.  It was no longer\nfrom, “My dearest John;” it was from “My Honoured Husband.”  The letters\nwere written on occasion of the publication of the same sermon which was\nrepresented in the picture.  The preaching before “My Lord Judge,” and\nthe “publishing by request,” was evidently the culminating point—the\nevent of his life.  It had been necessary for him to go up to London to\nsuperintend it through the press.  Many friends had to be called upon\nand consulted before he could decide on any printer fit for so onerous a\ntask; and at length it was arranged that J. and J. Rivingtons were to\nhave the honourable responsibility.  The worthy rector seemed to be\nstrung up by the occasion to a high literary pitch, for he could hardly\nwrite a letter to his wife without cropping out into Latin.  I remember\nthe end of one of his letters ran thus: “I shall ever hold the virtuous\nqualities of my Molly in remembrance, _dum memor ipse mei_, _dum\nspiritus regit artus_,” which, considering that the English of his\ncorrespondent was sometimes at fault in grammar, and often in spelling,\nmight be taken as a proof of how much he “idealised his Molly;” and, as\nMiss Jenkyns used to say, “People talk a great deal about idealising\nnow-a-days, whatever that may mean.”  But this was nothing to a fit of\nwriting classical poetry which soon seized him, in which his Molly\nfigured away as “Maria.”  The letter containing the _carmen_ was\nendorsed by her, “Hebrew verses sent me by my honoured husband.  I thowt\nto have had a letter about killing the pig, but must wait.  Mem., to\nsend the poetry to Sir Peter Arley, as my husband desires.”  And in a\npost-scriptum note in his handwriting it was stated that the Ode had\nappeared in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, December 1782."

  "content": "Her letters back to her husband (treasured as fondly by him as if they\nhad been _M. T. Ciceronis Epistolæ_) were more satisfactory to an absent\nhusband and father than his could ever have been to her.  She told him\nhow Deborah sewed her seam very neatly every day, and read to her in the\nbooks he had set her; how she was a very “forrard,” good child, but\nwould ask questions her mother could not answer, but how she did not let\nherself down by saying she did not know, but took to stirring the fire,\nor sending the “forrard” child on an errand.  Matty was now the mother’s\ndarling, and promised (like her sister at her age), to be a great\nbeauty. I was reading this aloud to Miss Matty, who smiled and sighed a\nlittle at the hope, so fondly expressed, that “little Matty might not be\nvain, even if she were a bewty.”“I had very pretty hair, my dear,” said Miss Matilda; “and not a bad\nmouth.”  And I saw her soon afterwards adjust her cap and draw herself\nup.But to return to Mrs Jenkyns’s letters.  She told her husband about the\npoor in the parish; what homely domestic medicines she had administered;\nwhat kitchen physic she had sent.  She had evidently held his\ndispleasure as a rod in pickle over the heads of all the ne’er-do-wells.\n She asked for his directions about the cows and pigs; and did not\nalways obtain them, as I have shown before.The kind old grandmother was dead when a little boy was born, soon after\nthe publication of the sermon; but there was another letter of\nexhortation from the grandfather, more stringent and admonitory than\never, now that there was a boy to be guarded from the snares of the\nworld.  He described all the various sins into which men might fall,\nuntil I wondered how any man ever came to a natural death.  The gallows\nseemed as if it must have been the termination of the lives of most of\nthe grandfather’s friends and acquaintance; and I was not surprised at\nthe way in which he spoke of this life being “a vale of tears.”It seemed curious that I should never have heard of this brother before;\nbut I concluded that he had died young, or else surely his name would\nhave been alluded to by his sisters."

She said all the others had been only\ninteresting to those who loved the writers, and that it seemed as if it\nwould have hurt her to allow them to fall into the hands of strangers,\nwho had not known her dear mother, and how good she was, although she\ndid not always spell, quite in the modern fashion; but Deborah’s letters\nwere so very superior! Any one might profit by reading them.  It was a\nlong time since she had read Mrs Chapone, but she knew she used to think\nthat Deborah could have said the same things quite as well; and as for\nMrs Carter! people thought a deal of her letters, just because she had\nwritten “Epictetus,” but she was quite sure Deborah would never have\nmade use of such a common expression as “I canna be fashed!”[Picture: I made use of the time to think of many other things]Miss Matty did grudge burning these letters, it was evident.  She would\nnot let them be carelessly passed over with any quiet reading, and\nskipping, to myself.  She took them from me, and even lighted the second\ncandle in order to read them aloud with a proper emphasis, and without\nstumbling over the big words.  Oh dear! how I wanted facts instead of\nreflections, before those letters were concluded!  They lasted us two\nnights; and I won’t deny that I made use of the time to think of many\nother things, and yet I was always at my post at the end of each\nsentence."

  "content": "The rector’s letters, and those of his wife and mother-in-law, had all\nbeen tolerably short and pithy, written in a straight hand, with the\nlines very close together.  Sometimes the whole letter was contained on\na mere scrap of paper.  The paper was very yellow, and the ink very\nbrown; some of the sheets were (as Miss Matty made me observe) the old\noriginal post, with the stamp in the corner representing a post-boy\nriding for life and twanging his horn.  The letters of Mrs Jenkyns and\nher mother were fastened with a great round red wafer; for it was before\nMiss Edgeworth’s “patronage” had banished wafers from polite society.\nIt was evident, from the tenor of what was said, that franks were in\ngreat request, and were even used as a means of paying debts by needy\nmembers of Parliament.  The rector sealed his epistles with an immense\ncoat of arms, and showed by the care with which he had performed this\nceremony that he expected they should be cut open, not broken by any\nthoughtless or impatient hand.  Now, Miss Jenkyns’s letters were of a\nlater date in form and writing.  She wrote on the square sheet which we\nhave learned to call old-fashioned.  Her hand was admirably calculated,\ntogether with her use of many-syllabled words, to fill up a sheet, and\nthen came the pride and delight of crossing.  Poor Miss Matty got sadly\npuzzled with this, for the words gathered size like snowballs, and\ntowards the end of her letter Miss Jenkyns used to become quite\nsesquipedalian.  In one to her father, slightly theological and\ncontroversial in its tone, she had spoken of Herod, Tetrarch of Idumea.\nMiss Matty read it “Herod Petrarch of Etruria,” and was just as well\npleased as if she had been right.I can’t quite remember the date, but I think it was in 1805 that Miss\nJenkyns wrote the longest series of letters—on occasion of her absence\non a visit to some friends near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  These friends were\nintimate with the commandant of the garrison there, and heard from him\nof all the preparations that were being made to repel the invasion of\nBuonaparte, which some people imagined might take place at the mouth of\nthe Tyne.  Miss Jenkyns was evidently very much alarmed; and the first\npart of her letters was often written in pretty intelligible English,\nconveying particulars of the preparations which were made in the family\nwith whom she was residing against the dreaded event; the bundles of\nclothes that were packed up ready for a flight to Alston Moor (a wild\nhilly piece of ground between Northumberland and Cumberland); the signal\nthat was to be given for this flight, and for the simultaneous turning\nout of the volunteers under arms—which said signal was to consist (if I\nremember rightly) in ringing the church bells in a particular and\nominous manner.  One day, when Miss Jenkyns and her hosts were at a\ndinner-party in Newcastle, this warning summons was actually given (not\na very wise proceeding, if there be any truth in the moral attached to\nthe fable of the Boy and the Wolf; but so it was), and Miss Jenkyns,\nhardly recovered from her fright, wrote the next day to describe the\nsound, the breathless shock, the hurry and alarm; and then, taking\nbreath, she added, “How trivial, my dear father, do all our\napprehensions of the last evening appear, at the present moment, to calm\nand enquiring minds!”  And here Miss Matty broke in with—"

  "content": "“But, indeed, my dear, they were not at all trivial or trifling at the\ntime.  I know I used to wake up in the night many a time and think I\nheard the tramp of the French entering Cranford.  Many people talked of\nhiding themselves in the salt mines—and meat would have kept capitally\ndown there, only perhaps we should have been thirsty.  And my father\npreached a whole set of sermons on the occasion; one set in the\nmornings, all about David and Goliath, to spirit up the people to\nfighting with spades or bricks, if need were; and the other set in the\nafternoons, proving that Napoleon (that was another name for Bony, as we\nused to call him) was all the same as an Apollyon and Abaddon.  I\nremember my father rather thought he should be asked to print this last\nset; but the parish had, perhaps, had enough of them with hearing.”Peter Marmaduke Arley Jenkyns (“poor Peter!” as Miss Matty began to call\nhim) was at school at Shrewsbury by this time.  The rector took up his\npen, and rubbed up his Latin once more, to correspond with his boy.  It\nwas very clear that the lad’s were what are called show letters.  They\nwere of a highly mental description, giving an account of his studies,\nand his intellectual hopes of various kinds, with an occasional\nquotation from the classics; but, now and then, the animal nature broke\nout in such a little sentence as this, evidently written in a trembling\nhurry, after the letter had been inspected: “Mother dear, do send me a\ncake, and put plenty of citron in.”  The “mother dear” probably answered\nher boy in the form of cakes and “goody,” for there were none of her\nletters among this set; but a whole collection of the rector’s, to whom\nthe Latin in his boy’s letters was like a trumpet to the old war-horse.\nI do not know much about Latin, certainly, and it is, perhaps, an\nornamental language, but not very useful, I think—at least to judge from\nthe bits I remember out of the rector’s letters.  One was, “You have not\ngot that town in your map of Ireland; but _Bonus Bernardus non videt\nomnia_, as the Proverbia say.”  Presently it became very evident that\n“poor Peter” got himself into many scrapes.  There were letters of\nstilted penitence to his father, for some wrong-doing; and among them\nall was a badly-written, badly-sealed, badly-directed, blotted note:—“My\ndear, dear, dear, dearest mother, I will be a better boy; I will,\nindeed; but don’t, please, be ill for me; I am not worth it; but I will\nbe good, darling mother.”"

But he was too fond\nof mischief.  He could never resist a joke.  Poor Peter!”CHAPTER VI.\nPOOR PETERPOOR Peter’s career lay before him rather pleasantly mapped out by kind\nfriends, but _Bonus Bernardus non videt omnia_, in this map too.  He was\nto win honours at the Shrewsbury School, and carry them thick to\nCambridge, and after that, a living awaited him, the gift of his\ngodfather, Sir Peter Arley.  Poor Peter! his lot in life was very\ndifferent to what his friends had hoped and planned.  Miss Matty told me\nall about it, and I think it was a relief when she had done so.He was the darling of his mother, who seemed to dote on all her\nchildren, though she was, perhaps, a little afraid of Deborah’s superior\nacquirements.  Deborah was the favourite of her father, and when Peter\ndisappointed him, she became his pride.  The sole honour Peter brought\naway from Shrewsbury was the reputation of being the best good fellow\nthat ever was, and of being the captain of the school in the art of\npractical joking.  His father was disappointed, but set about remedying\nthe matter in a manly way.  He could not afford to send Peter to read\nwith any tutor, but he could read with him himself; and Miss Matty told\nme much of the awful preparations in the way of dictionaries and\nlexicons that were made in her father’s study the morning Peter began.“My poor mother!” said she.  “I remember how she used to stand in the\nhall, just near enough the study-door, to catch the tone of my father’s\nvoice.  I could tell in a moment if all was going right, by her face.\nAnd it did go right for a long time.”“What went wrong at last?” said I.  “That tiresome Latin, I dare say.”"

But he seemed to think that the Cranford\npeople might be joked about, and made fun of, and they did not like it;\nnobody does.  He was always hoaxing them; ‘hoaxing’ is not a pretty\nword, my dear, and I hope you won’t tell your father I used it, for I\nshould not like him to think that I was not choice in my language, after\nliving with such a woman as Deborah.  And be sure you never use it\nyourself.  I don’t know how it slipped out of my mouth, except it was\nthat I was thinking of poor Peter and it was always his expression.  But\nhe was a very gentlemanly boy in many things.  He was like dear Captain\nBrown in always being ready to help any old person or a child.  Still,\nhe did like joking and making fun; and he seemed to think the old ladies\nin Cranford would believe anything.  There were many old ladies living\nhere then; we are principally ladies now, I know, but we are not so old\nas the ladies used to be when I was a girl.  I could laugh to think of\nsome of Peter’s jokes.  No, my dear, I won’t tell you of them, because\nthey might not shock you as they ought to do, and they were very\nshocking.  He even took in my father once, by dressing himself up as a\nlady that was passing through the town and wished to see the Rector of\nCranford, ‘who had published that admirable Assize Sermon.’  Peter said\nhe was awfully frightened himself when he saw how my father took it all\nin, and even offered to copy out all his Napoleon Buonaparte sermons for\nher—him, I mean—no, her, for Peter was a lady then.  He told me he was\nmore terrified than he ever was before, all the time my father was\nspeaking. He did not think my father would have believed him; and yet if\nhe had not, it would have been a sad thing for Peter.  As it was, he was\nnone so glad of it, for my father kept him hard at work copying out all\nthose twelve Buonaparte sermons for the lady—that was for Peter himself,\nyou know.  He was the lady.  And once when he wanted to go fishing,\nPeter said, ‘Confound the woman!’—very bad language, my dear, but Peter\nwas not always so guarded as he should have been; my father was so angry\nwith him, it nearly frightened me out of my wits: and yet I could hardly\nkeep from laughing at the little curtseys Peter kept making, quite\nslyly, whenever my father spoke of the lady’s excellent taste and sound\ndiscrimination.”"

My father was\namongst them, meaning, he said, to ask them to walk into the garden with\nhim, and admire the beautiful vegetable production, when—oh, my dear, I\ntremble to think of it—he looked through the rails himself, and saw—I\ndon’t know what he thought he saw, but old Clare told me his face went\nquite grey-white with anger, and his eyes blazed out under his frowning\nblack brows; and he spoke out—oh, so terribly!—and bade them all stop\nwhere they were—not one of them to go, not one of them to stir a step;\nand, swift as light, he was in at the garden door, and down the Filbert\nwalk, and seized hold of poor Peter, and tore his clothes off his\nback—bonnet, shawl, gown, and all—and threw the pillow among the people\nover the railings: and then he was very, very angry indeed, and before\nall the people he lifted up his cane and flogged Peter!"

Old Clare said, Peter looked as white as my\nfather; and stood as still as a statue to be flogged; and my father\nstruck hard!  When my father stopped to take breath, Peter said, ‘Have\nyou done enough, sir?’ quite hoarsely, and still standing quite quiet.\nI don’t know what my father said—or if he said anything.  But old Clare\nsaid, Peter turned to where the people outside the railing were, and\nmade them a low bow, as grand and as grave as any gentleman; and then\nwalked slowly into the house.  I was in the store-room helping my mother\nto make cowslip wine.  I cannot abide the wine now, nor the scent of the\nflowers; they turn me sick and faint, as they did that day, when Peter\ncame in, looking as haughty as any man—indeed, looking like a man, not\nlike a boy. ‘Mother!’ he said, ‘I am come to say, God bless you for\never.’  I saw his lips quiver as he spoke; and I think he durst not say\nanything more loving, for the purpose that was in his heart.  She\nlooked at him rather frightened, and wondering, and asked him what was\nto do.  He did not smile or speak, but put his arms round her and kissed\nher as if he did not know how to leave off; and before she could speak\nagain, he was gone. We talked it over, and could not understand it, and\nshe bade me go and seek my father, and ask what it was all about.  I\nfound him walking up and down, looking very highly displeased.“‘Tell your mother I have flogged Peter, and that he richly deserved\nit.’“I durst not ask any more questions.  When I told my mother, she sat\ndown, quite faint, for a minute.  I remember, a few days after, I saw\nthe poor, withered cowslip flowers thrown out to the leaf heap, to decay\nand die there.  There was no making of cowslip wine that year at the\nrectory—nor, indeed, ever after."

I know I thought of Queen\nEsther and King Ahasuerus; for my mother was very pretty and\ndelicate-looking, and my father looked as terrible as King Ahasuerus.\nSome time after they came out together; and then my mother told me what\nhad happened, and that she was going up to Peter’s room at my father’s\ndesire—though she was not to tell Peter this—to talk the matter over\nwith him.  But no Peter was there.  We looked over the house; no Peter\nwas there!  Even my father, who had not liked to join in the search at\nfirst, helped us before long. The rectory was a very old house—steps up\ninto a room, steps down into a room, all through.  At first, my mother\nwent calling low and soft, as if to reassure the poor boy, ‘Peter!\nPeter, dear! it’s only me;’ but, by-and-by, as the servants came back\nfrom the errands my father had sent them, in different directions, to\nfind where Peter was—as we found he was not in the garden, nor the\nhayloft, nor anywhere about—my mother’s cry grew louder and wilder,\n‘Peter!  Peter, my darling! where are you?’ for then she felt and\nunderstood that that long kiss meant some sad kind of ‘good-bye.’  The\nafternoon went on—my mother never resting, but seeking again and again\nin every possible place that had been looked into twenty times before,\nnay, that she had looked into over and over again herself. My father sat\nwith his head in his hands, not speaking except when his messengers came\nin, bringing no tidings; then he lifted up his face, so strong and sad,\nand told them to go again in some new direction.  My mother kept passing\nfrom room to room, in and out of the house, moving noiselessly, but\nnever ceasing.  Neither she nor my father durst leave the house, which\nwas the meeting-place for all the messengers.  At last (and it was\nnearly dark), my father rose up.  He took hold of my mother’s arm as she\ncame with wild, sad pace through one door, and quickly towards another.\nShe started at the touch of his hand, for she had forgotten all in the\nworld but Peter."

But when she saw this, a gentle sorrow came over her countenance,\nand she said, ‘Dearest John! don’t cry; come with me, and we’ll find\nhim,’ almost as cheerfully as if she knew where he was.  And she took my\nfather’s great hand in her little soft one, and led him along, the tears\ndropping as he walked on that same unceasing, weary walk, from room to\nroom, through house and garden.“Oh, how I wished for Deborah!  I had no time for crying, for now all\nseemed to depend on me.  I wrote for Deborah to come home.  I sent a\nmessage privately to that same Mr Holbrook’s house—poor Mr Holbrook;—you\nknow who I mean.  I don’t mean I sent a message to him, but I sent one\nthat I could trust to know if Peter was at his house.  For at one time\nMr Holbrook was an occasional visitor at the rectory—you know he was\nMiss Pole’s cousin—and he had been very kind to Peter, and taught him\nhow to fish—he was very kind to everybody, and I thought Peter might\nhave gone off there.  But Mr Holbrook was from home, and Peter had never\nbeen seen. It was night now; but the doors were all wide open, and my\nfather and mother walked on and on; it was more than an hour since he\nhad joined her, and I don’t believe they had ever spoken all that time.\nI was getting the parlour fire lighted, and one of the servants was\npreparing tea, for I wanted them to have something to eat and drink and\nwarm them, when old Clare asked to speak to me."

Her soft eyes never were the same\nagain after that; they had always a restless, craving look, as if\nseeking for what they could not find.

They had returned it unopened; and unopened\nit had remained ever since, having been inadvertently put by among the\nother letters of that time.  This is it:—“MY DEAREST PETER,—You did not think we should be so sorry as we\n    are, I know, or you would never have gone away.  You are too good.\n    Your father sits and sighs till my heart aches to hear him.  He\n    cannot hold up his head for grief; and yet he only did what he\n    thought was right.

Come back, and\n    make us happy, who love you so much.  I know you will come back.”But Peter did not come back.  That spring day was the last time he ever\nsaw his mother’s face.  The writer of the letter—the last—the only\nperson who had ever seen what was written in it, was dead long ago; and\nI, a stranger, not born at the time when this occurrence took place, was\nthe one to open it.The captain’s letter summoned the father and mother to Liverpool\ninstantly, if they wished to see their boy; and, by some of the wild\nchances of life, the captain’s letter had been detained somewhere,\nsomehow.Miss Matty went on, “And it was racetime, and all the post-horses at\nCranford were gone to the races; but my father and mother set off in our\nown gig—and oh! my dear, they were too late—the ship was gone!  And now\nread Peter’s letter to my mother!”It was full of love, and sorrow, and pride in his new profession, and a\nsore sense of his disgrace in the eyes of the people at Cranford; but\nending with a passionate entreaty that she would come and see him before\nhe left the Mersey: “Mother; we may go into battle.  I hope we shall,\nand lick those French: but I must see you again before that time.”“And she was too late,” said Miss Matty; “too late!”We sat in silence, pondering on the full meaning of those sad, sad\nwords.

He\nwould, perhaps, speak in his old way—laying down the law, as it were—and\nthen, in a minute or two, he would come round and put his hand on our\nshoulders, and ask us in a low voice, if he had said anything to hurt\nus.

And she would speak of how she thought\nPeter stood a good chance of being admiral very soon—he was so brave and\nclever; and how she thought of seeing him in his navy uniform, and what\nsort of hats admirals wore; and how much more fit he was to be a sailor\nthan a clergyman; and all in that way, just to make my father think she\nwas quite glad of what came of that unlucky morning’s work, and the\nflogging which was always in his mind, as we all knew.  But oh, my dear!\nthe bitter, bitter crying she had when she was alone; and at last, as\nshe grew weaker, she could not keep her tears in when Deborah or me was\nby, and would give us message after message for Peter (his ship had gone\nto the Mediterranean, or somewhere down there, and then he was ordered\noff to India, and there was no overland route then); but she still said\nthat no one knew where their death lay in wait, and that we were not to\nthink hers was near.  We did not think it, but we knew it, as we saw her\nfading away.“Well, my dear, it’s very foolish of me, I know, when in all likelihood\nI am so near seeing her again.“And only think, love! the very day after her death—for she did not live\nquite a twelvemonth after Peter went away—the very day after—came a\nparcel for her from India—from her poor boy.

We decked her in the long soft\nfolds; she lay smiling, as if pleased; and people came—all Cranford\ncame—to beg to see her, for they had loved her dearly, as well they\nmight; and the countrywomen brought posies; old Clare’s wife brought\nsome white violets and begged they might lie on her breast.“Deborah said to me, the day of my mother’s funeral, that if she had a\nhundred offers she never would marry and leave my father.  It was not\nvery likely she would have so many—I don’t know that she had one; but it\nwas not less to her credit to say so.  She was such a daughter to my\nfather as I think there never was before or since.

She could do many more things than\nmy poor mother could; she even once wrote a letter to the bishop for my\nfather.  But he missed my mother sorely; the whole parish noticed it.\nNot that he was less active; I think he was more so, and more patient in\nhelping every one.  I did all I could to set Deborah at liberty to be\nwith him; for I knew I was good for little, and that my best work in the\nworld was to do odd jobs quietly, and set others at liberty.

Not but what my father always wanted her when there\nwas letter-writing or reading to be done, or anything to be settled.”“And then?” said I, after a pause.“Then Peter went to sea again; and, by-and-by, my father died, blessing\nus both, and thanking Deborah for all she had been to him; and, of\ncourse, our circumstances were changed; and, instead of living at the\nrectory, and keeping three maids and a man, we had to come to this small\nhouse, and be content with a servant-of-all-work; but, as Deborah used\nto say, we have always lived genteelly, even if circumstances have\ncompelled us to simplicity.

Miss Matty assented, and\nquickly disappeared to change the yellow ribbons, while Miss Barker came\nupstairs; but, as she had forgotten her spectacles, and was rather\nflurried by the unusual time of the visit, I was not surprised to see\nher return with one cap on the top of the other.  She was quite\nunconscious of it herself, and looked at us, with bland satisfaction.\nNor do I think Miss Barker perceived it; for, putting aside the little\ncircumstance that she was not so young as she had been, she was very\nmuch absorbed in her errand, which she delivered herself of with an\noppressive modesty that found vent in endless apologies.Miss Betty Barker was the daughter of the old clerk at Cranford who had\nofficiated in Mr Jenkyns’s time.  She and her sister had had pretty good\nsituations as ladies’ maids, and had saved money enough to set up a\nmilliner’s shop, which had been patronised by the ladies in the\nneighbourhood.  Lady Arley, for instance, would occasionally give Miss\nBarkers the pattern of an old cap of hers, which they immediately copied\nand circulated among the _élite_ of Cranford.  I say the _élite_, for\nMiss Barkers had caught the trick of the place, and piqued themselves\nupon their “aristocratic connection.”  They would not sell their caps\nand ribbons to anyone without a pedigree.  Many a farmer’s wife or\ndaughter turned away huffed from Miss Barkers’ select millinery, and\nwent rather to the universal shop, where the profits of brown soap and\nmoist sugar enabled the proprietor to go straight to (Paris, he said,\nuntil he found his customers too patriotic and John Bullish to wear what\nthe Mounseers wore) London, where, as he often told his customers, Queen\nAdelaide had appeared, only the very week before, in a cap exactly like\nthe one he showed them, trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons, and had\nbeen complimented by King William on the becoming nature of her\nhead-dress."
