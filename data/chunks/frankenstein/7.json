  "content": "The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\nlower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\nsank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\nshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\nhay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\nthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\nme and cling to me for ever.Chapter 23It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\nshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and\ncontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\nin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\nin the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the\nflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the\nscene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves\nthat were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\nshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious\nand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\nmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\nlife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\nof my adversary was extinguished.Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\nbut there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\ntrembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?\nWhat is it you fear?”“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and\nall will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”"

  "content": "I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\nfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\nand I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her\nuntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\nof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\nmy adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\nexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\nscream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\ntrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\ninto the room.Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\ndestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\nand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\nturn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\nby the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\nLife is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\nonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground."

I\nescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\nwife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\nposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\nher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\nsupposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\nin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\nThe murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the\nbreath had ceased to issue from her lips.While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\npanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\nThe shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\ndescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\nA grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\nfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\nthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\nleaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\nplunged into the lake.The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\nthe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\nboats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we\nreturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\nform conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to\nsearch the country, parties going in different directions among the\nwoods and vines.I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\nhouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\nwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\nI had lost."

  "content": "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\nwhere the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\nhung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\ndistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\ncause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\nof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\nof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\nfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\nfeet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\nup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\nhardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\nto row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\nmental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\nand the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\nexertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\nto every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\nfamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\nbefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\nTears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\nthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\nthen been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\na great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\nbut nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\nsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\nso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\nman.But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\noverwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\n_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\nown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\nmy hideous narration."

  "content": "I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\nunder the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\nman! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\ndelight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\nall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\nfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\nbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\nin wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\naround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\nrise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\nindeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\nwith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\ndungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\nconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\nprison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\nmemory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\ncause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\nsent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\nmaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\nthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\nrevenge on his cursed head.Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\na month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\nand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\ndestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\nauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be\nassured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall\nbe spared to discover the villain.”"

  "content": "“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\ndeposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\nshould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\nwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\nbe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\nmanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\nown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\nquieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\nmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\naccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\nhe became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\nhorror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\non his countenance.When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I\naccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\nwhole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\nyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\nfunctions on this occasion.”This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\nauditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\nto a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\nto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\nreturned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\nevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\nhave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\nanimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\nno man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\nthe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\nhas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\nhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\nand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\ncredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\npunishment which is his desert.”"

But I fear, from what you have\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\nmake up your mind to disappointment.”“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\nis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\nloose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\nbut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\nhis destruction.”I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\nmadness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of\nwisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on\nsome other mode of action.Chapter 24My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\nswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\nwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\nhateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\nwhich had belonged to my mother, and departed."

  "content": "And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\nwhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I\nhave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\nthe sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared\nnot die and leave my adversary in being.When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\nwhat path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\nreposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\ngraves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\nobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\ncast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\nmourner.The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\nrage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\nand to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\nand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\nsacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\ndeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\nspirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\nuntil he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\npreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\neyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\nministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\nand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\ntorments me.”I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\nthat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but\nthe furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance."

It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\nit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\nSurely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\ndestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\nwas reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\naudible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have\ndetermined to live, and I am satisfied.”I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil\neluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone\nfull upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than\nmortal speed.I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The\nblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\nenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I\ntook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\nhave ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by\nthis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\nwho feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\nleft some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw\nthe print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering\non life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\nwhat I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the\nleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\nfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\nextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,\nwhen nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\nwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\nfare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\nI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\ninvoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\nI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\nfew drops that revived me, and vanish."

In other places human beings were seldom\nseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\npath. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\nby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\nwhich, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\nprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\nsleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\nspirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\nhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\nthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\nsustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\nfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\ncountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\nvoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\na toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\ncome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\nfriends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\ntheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\npersuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\nburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\ndestruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\nmechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\nardent desire of my soul.What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\nleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\nme and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet\nover”—these words were legible in one of these\ninscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I\nseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\ncold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if\nyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.

The peasants were\nshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\nseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\nseek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\nprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\ninscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils\nonly begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter\nupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\nhatred.”My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\nresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\nuntil the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\nof the horizon.

I know not whether the\nfiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\nwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\nhamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\nfiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\nputting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\nhis terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter\nfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\nnumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\nnight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\njourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\nconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\nice or frozen by the eternal frosts.On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\nHe had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\nof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\nreturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\nAfter a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\nround and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\nthe Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\ndeparted from land.I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\nmisery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support.

Once, after\nthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\nsummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to\ndiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\ndistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\nform within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\nWarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\nnot intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was\ndimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\noppressed me, I wept aloud.But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\nhour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\nirksome to me, I continued my route.

A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\nthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\nand terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\nand, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\ntremendous and overwhelming sound.

Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\ndifficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes\nwere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\nand quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his\ncountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\nof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor."

  "content": "His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\nyet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\nand the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\ngreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\nhowever earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!\nI cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\ncreature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your\nsenseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the\nworld a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek\nto increase your own.”Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\nto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\nbut principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\nwith his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said\nhe, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\nposterity.”Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\ntale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my\nsoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\nand his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe\nhim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\nevery hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can\nnow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\ndeath. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\ndelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\nfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\nremote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\nthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth."

On every point of general literature he displays\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\na pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\nwithout tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\nof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems\nto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for\nsome great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\nof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\nthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\nfor I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\nmight be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had\ncompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\nanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But\nthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes\nare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\nchained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\nanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\nconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot\nrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod\nheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\nof their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\nambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once\nwas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\nnever, never again to rise.”Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\nvalue and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea."

Can any\nman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even\nwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\nthe companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\nminds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our\ninfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\nare never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a\nbrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\nsuspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\nhowever strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\ncontemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\nthrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\nI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\nClerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one\nfeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\ngave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”My beloved Sister,September 2d.I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\ndoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\nit. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\nthreaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I\nhave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\nnone to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our\nsituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is\nterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\nthrough me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and\nyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My\nbeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\nin prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband\nand lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He\nendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\nwhich he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have\nhappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel\nthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\nrouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\nvast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\nresolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\ncaused by this despair.September 5th.A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is\nhighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\nforbear recording it."

The cold is excessive, and many of\nmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\ndesolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\nstill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\nlifelessness.I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\nThis morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his\neyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half\na dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They\nentered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\nto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\nWe were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\nfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\npassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\nthis. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\ncourse southwards.This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\nthe idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in\npossibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when\nFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.

Not because the way was\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\nterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\nand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\nthese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this\nwas it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the\nbenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\nwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,\nbehold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\nmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\nto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\nperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\nfiresides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\nthus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\nyourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your\npurposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\nhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\nshall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\nmarked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\nwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\nin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\nyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were\nunable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\nbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\ndesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\nwould return.They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\nalmost deprived of life.How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than\nreturn shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my\nfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\nwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.September 7th.The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.\nThus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\nignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess\nto bear this injustice with patience.September 12th.It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility\nand glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\ntowards England and towards you, I will not despond."

We were\nin the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\nattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\nsuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked\nbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\nthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\nfree. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\ncountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\nloud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\ncause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they\nwill soon return to England.”“Do you, then, really return?”“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.”“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\nsufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\nbed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\nentirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\ndifficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing\ndraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he\ntold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live."

I sat\nby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\nsaid, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\nsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\nnot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\nhatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\njustified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\nhave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\nIn a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\nbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\nwell-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\nthat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\nmy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\nmisery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\ncreate a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\nand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\nbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\nknow where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\nmine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\nwhen I am only induced by reason and virtue.“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\nthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\nlittle chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\napproach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\nmay still be misled by passion.“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\nother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\nonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of\nthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\nWalton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\nscience and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\neffort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he\nattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\nhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\naway from his lips.Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\nglorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the\ndepth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\nfeeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\ndisappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\nconsolation.I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.\nGood night, my sister."
