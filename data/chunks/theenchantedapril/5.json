  "content": "Rose had spent the day by herself, sitting with her hands clasping her\nknees, staring straight in front of her. What she was staring at were\nthe grey swords of the agaves, and, on their tall stalks, the pale\nirises that grew in the remote place she had found, while beyond them,\nbetween the grey leaves and the blue flowers, she saw the sea. The\nplace she had found was a hidden corner where the sun-baked stones were\npadded with thyme, and nobody was likely to come. It was out of sight\nand sound of the house; it was off any path; it was near the end of the\npromontory. She sat so quiet that presently lizards darted over her\nfeet, and some tiny birds like finches, frightened away at first, came\nback again and flitted among the bushes round her just as if she hadn’t\nbeen there. How beautiful it was. And what was the good of it with no\none there, no one who loved being with one, who belonged to one, to\nwhom one could say, “Look.” And wouldn’t one say, “Look—_dearest?_”\nYes, one would say _dearest_ and the sweet word, just to say it to\nsomebody who loved one, would make one happy.She sat quite still, staring straight in front of her. Strange that in\nthis place she did not want to pray. She who had prayed so constantly\nat home didn’t seem able to do it here at all. The first morning she\nhad merely thrown up a brief thank you to heaven on getting out of bed,\nand had gone straight to the window to see what everything looked\nlike—thrown up the thank you as carelessly as a ball, and thought no\nmore about it. That morning, remembering this and ashamed, she had\nknelt down with determination; but perhaps determination was bad for\nprayers, for she had been unable to think of a thing to say. And as for\nher bedtime prayers, on neither of the nights had she said a single\none. She had forgotten them. She had been so much absorbed in other\nthoughts that she had forgotten them; and, once in bed, she was asleep\nand whirling along among bright, thin swift dreams before she had so\nmuch time as to stretch herself out.What had come over her? Why had she let go the anchor of prayer? And\nshe had difficulty, too, in remembering her poor, in remembering even\nthat there were such things as poor. Holidays, of course, were good,\nand were recognised by everybody as good, but ought they so completely\nto blot out, to make such havoc of, the realities? Perhaps it was\nhealthy to forget her poor; with all the greater gusto would she go\nback to them. But it couldn’t be healthy to forget her prayers, and\nstill less could it be healthy not to mind.Rose did not mind. She knew she did not mind. And, even worse, she knew\nshe did not mind not minding. In this place she was indifferent to both\nthe things that had filled her life and made it seem as if it were\nhappy for years. Well, if only she could rejoice in her wonderful new\nsurroundings, have that much at least to set against the indifference,\nthe letting go—but she could not. She had no work; she did not pray;\nshe was left empty."

  "content": "Lotty had spoilt her day that day, as she had spoilt her day the day\nbefore—Lotty, with her invitation to her husband, with her suggestion\nthat she too should invite hers. Having flung Frederick into her mind\nagain the day before, Lotty had left her; for the whole afternoon she\nhad left her alone with her thoughts. Since then they had been all of\nFrederick. Where at Hampstead he came to her only in her dreams, here\nhe left her dreams free and was with her during the day instead. And\nagain that morning, as she was struggling not to think of him, Lotty\nhad asked her, just before disappearing singing down the path, if she\nhad written yet and invited him, and again he was flung into her mind\nand she wasn’t able to get him out.How could she invite him? It had gone on so long, their estrangement,\nsuch years; she would hardly know what words to use; and besides, he\nwould not come. Why should he come? He didn’t care about being with\nher. What could they talk about? Between them was the barrier of his\nwork and her religion. She could not—how could she, believing as she\ndid in purity, in responsibility for the effect of one’s actions on\nothers—bear his work, bear living by it; and he, she knew, had at first\nresented and then been merely bored by her religion. He had let her\nslip away; he had given her up; he no longer minded; he accepted her\nreligion indifferently, as a settled fact. Both it and she—Rose’s mind,\nbecoming more luminous in the clear light of April at San Salvatore,\nsuddenly saw the truth—bored him.Naturally when she saw this, when that morning it flashed upon her for\nthe first time, she did not like it; she liked it so little that for a\nspace the whole beauty of Italy was blotted out. What was to be done\nabout it? She could not give up believing in good and not liking evil,\nand it must be evil to live entirely on the proceeds of adulteries,\nhowever dead and distinguished they were. Besides, if she did, if she\nsacrificed her whole past, her bringing up, her work for the last ten\nyears, would she bore him less? Rose felt right down at her very roots\nthat if you have once thoroughly bored somebody it is next to\nimpossible to unbore him. Once a bore always a bore—certainly, she\nthought, to the person originally bored."

  "content": "Then, thought she, looking out to sea through eyes grown misty, better\ncling to her religion. It was better—she hardly noticed the\nreprehensibleness of her thought—than nothing. But oh, she wanted to\ncling to something tangible, to love something living, something that\none could hold against one’s heart, that one could see and touch and do\nthings for. If her poor baby hadn’t died . . . babies didn’t get bored\nwith one, it took them a long while to grow up and find one out. And\nperhaps one’s baby never did find one out; perhaps one would always be\nto it, however old and bearded it grew, somebody special, somebody\ndifferent from every one else, and if for no other reason, precious in\nthat one could never be repeated.Sitting with dim eyes looking out to sea she felt an extraordinary\nyearning to hold something of her very own tight to her bosom. Rose was\nslender, and as reserved in figure as in character, yet she felt a\nqueer sensation of—how could she describe it?—bosom. There was\nsomething about San Salvatore that made her feel all bosom. She wanted\nto gather to her bosom, to comfort and protect, soothing the dear head\nthat should lie on it with softest strokings and murmurs of love.\nFrederick, Frederick’s child—come to her, pillowed on her, because they\nwere unhappy, because they had been hurt. . . They would need her then,\nif they had been hurt; they would let themselves be loved then, if they\nwere unhappy.Well, the child was gone, would never come now; but perhaps\nFrederick—some day—when he was old and tired . . .Such were Mrs. Arbuthnot’s reflections and emotions that first day at\nSan Salvatore by herself. She went back to tea dejected as she had not\nbeen for years. San Salvatore had taken her carefully built-up\nsemblance of happiness away from her, and given her nothing in\nexchange. Yes—it had given her yearnings in exchange, this ache and\nlonging, this queer feeling of bosom; but that was worse than nothing.\nAnd she who had learned balance, who never at home was irritated but\nalways able to be kind, could not, even in her dejection, that\nafternoon endure Mrs. Fisher’s assumption of the position as hostess at\ntea."

  "content": "One would have supposed that such a little thing would not have touched\nher, but it did. Was her nature changing? Was she to be not only thrown\nback on long-stifled yearnings after Frederick, but also turned into\nsomebody who wanted to fight over little things? After tea, when both\nMrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline had disappeared again—it was quite\nevident that nobody wanted her—she was more dejected than ever,\noverwhelmed by the discrepancy between the splendour outside her, the\nwarm, teeming beauty and self-sufficiency of nature, and the blank\nemptiness of her heart.Then came Lotty, back to dinner, incredibly more freckled, exuding the\nsunshine she had been collecting all day, talking, laughing, being\ntactless, being unwise, being without reticence; and Lady Caroline, so\nquiet at tea, woke up to animation, and Mrs. Fisher was not so\nnoticeable, and Rose was beginning to revive a little, for Lotty’s\nspirits were contagious as she described the delights of her day, a day\nwhich might easily to any one else have had nothing in it but a very\nlong and very hot walk and sandwiches, when she suddenly said catching\nRose’s eye, “Letter gone?”Rose flushed. This tactlessness . . .“What letter?” asked Scrap, interested. Both her elbows were on the\ntable and her chin was supported in her hands, for the nut-stage had\nbeen reached, and there was nothing for it but to wait in as\ncomfortable as position as possible till Mrs. Fisher had finished\ncracking.“Asking her husband here,” said Lotty.Mrs. Fisher looked up. Another husband? Was there to be no end to them?\nNor was this one, then, a widow either; but her husband was no doubt a\ndecent, respectable man, following a decent, respectable calling. She\nhad little hope of Mr. Wilkins; so little, that she had refrained from\ninquiring what he did.“Has it?” persisted Lotty, as Rose said nothing.“No,” said Rose.“Oh, well—to-morrow then,” said Lotty.Rose wanted to say No again to this. Lotty would have in her place, and\nwould, besides, have expounded all her reasons. But she could not turn\nherself inside out like that and invite any and everybody to come and\nlook. How was it that Lotty, who saw so many things, didn’t see stuck\non her heart, and seeing keep quiet about it, the sore place that was\nFrederick?“Who is your husband?” asked Mrs. Fisher, carefully adjusting another\nnut between the crackers.“Who should he be,” said Rose quickly, roused at once by Mrs. Fisher to\nirritation, “except _Mr._ Arbuthnot?”“I mean, of course, what is Mr. Arbuthnot?”"

  "content": "And Rose, gone painfully red at this, said after a tiny pause, “My\nhusband.”Naturally, Mrs. Fisher was incensed. She couldn’t have believed it of\nthis one, with her decent hair and gentle voice, that she too should be\nimpertinent.Chapter 14That first week the wistaria began to fade, and the flowers of the\nJudas-tree and peach-trees fell off and carpeted the ground with\nrose-colour. Then all the freesias disappeared, and the irises grew\nscarce. And then, while these were clearing themselves away, the double\nbanksia roses came out, and the big summer roses suddenly flaunted\ngorgeously on the walls and trellises. Fortune’s Yellow was one of\nthem; a very beautiful rose. Presently the tamarisk and the daphnes\nwere at their best, and the lilies at their tallest. By the end of the\nweek the fig-trees were giving shade, the plum-blossom was out among\nthe olives, the modest weigelias appeared in their fresh pink clothes,\nand on the rocks sprawled masses of thick-leaved, star-shaped flowers,\nsome vivid purple and some a clear, pale lemon.By the end of the week, too, Mr. Wilkins arrived; even as his wife had\nforeseen he would, so he did. And there were signs almost of eagerness\nabout his acceptance of her suggestion, for he had not waited to write\na letter in answer to hers, but had telegraphed.That, surely, was eager. It showed, Scrap thought, a definite wish for\nreunion; and watching his wife’s happy face, and aware of her desire\nthat Mellersh should enjoy his holiday, she told herself that he would\nbe a very unusual fool should he waste his time bothering about anybody\nelse. “If he isn’t nice to her,” Scrap thought, “he shall be taken to\nthe battlements and tipped over.” For, by the end of the week, she and\nMrs. Wilkins had become Caroline and Lotty to each other, and were\nfriends."

  "content": "Mrs. Wilkins had always been friends, but Scrap had struggled not to\nbe. She had tried hard to be cautious, but how difficult was caution\nwith Mrs. Wilkins! Free herself from every vestige of it, she was so\nentirely unreserved, so completely expansive, that soon Scrap, almost\nbefore she knew what she was doing, was being unreserved too. And\nnobody could be more unreserved than Scrap, once she let herself go.The only difficulty about Lotty was that she was nearly always\nsomewhere else. You couldn’t catch her; you couldn’t pin her down to\ncome and talk. Scrap’s fears that she would grab seemed grotesque in\nretrospect. Why, there was no grab in her. At dinner and after dinner\nwere the only times one really saw her. All day long she was invisible,\nand would come back in the late afternoon looking a perfect sight, her\nhair full of bits of moss, and her freckles worse than ever. Perhaps\nshe was making the most of her time before Mellersh arrived to do all\nthe things she wanted to do, and meant to devote herself afterwards to\ngoing about with him, tidy and in her best clothes.Scrap watched her, interested in spite of herself, because it seemed so\nextraordinary to be as happy as all that on so little. San Salvatore\nwas beautiful, and the weather was divine; but scenery and weather had\nnever been enough for Scrap, and how could they be enough for somebody\nwho would have to leave them quite soon and go back to life in\nHampstead? Also, there was the imminence of Mellersh, of that Mellersh\nfrom whom Lotty had so lately run. It was all very well to feel one\nought to share, and to make a _beau geste_ and do it, but the _beaux\ngestes_ Scrap had known hadn’t made anybody happy. Nobody really liked\nbeing the object of one, and it always meant an effort on the part of\nthe maker. Still, she had to admit there was no effort about Lotty; it\nwas quite plain that everything she did and said was effortless, and\nthat she was just simply, completely happy."

  "content": "And so Mrs. Wilkins was; for her doubts as to whether she had had time\nto become steady enough in serenity to go on being serene in Mellersh’s\ncompany when she had it uninterruptedly right round the clock, had gone\nby the middle of the week, and she felt that nothing now could shake\nher. She was ready for anything. She was firmly grafted, rooted, built\ninto heaven. Whatever Mellersh said or did, she would not budge an inch\nout of heaven, would not rouse herself a single instant to come outside\nit and be cross. On the contrary, she was going to pull him up into it\nbeside her, and they would sit comfortably together, suffused in light,\nand laugh at how much afraid of him she used to be in Hampstead, and at\nhow deceitful her afraidness had made her. But he wouldn’t need much\npulling. He would come in quite naturally after a day or two,\nirresistibly wafted on the scented breezes of that divine air; and\nthere he would sit arrayed in stars, thought Mrs. Wilkins, in whose\nmind, among much other _débris_, floated occasional bright shreds of\npoetry. She laughed to herself a little at the picture of Mellersh,\nthat top-hatted, black-coated, respectable family solicitor, arrayed in\nstars, but she laughed affectionately, almost with a maternal pride in\nhow splendid he would look in such fine clothes. “Poor lamb,” she\nmurmured to herself affectionately. And added, “What he wants is a\nthorough airing.”This was during the first half of the week. By the beginning of the\nlast half, at the end of which Mr. Wilkins arrived, she left off even\nassuring herself that she was unshakeable, that she was permeated\nbeyond altering by the atmosphere, she no longer thought of it or\nnoticed it; she took it for granted. If one may say so, and she\ncertainly said so, not only to herself but also to Lady Caroline, she\nhad found her celestial legs.Contrary to Mrs. Fisher’s idea of the seemly—but of course contrary;\nwhat else would one expect of Mrs. Wilkins?—she did not go to meet her\nhusband at Mezzago, but merely walked down to the point where Beppo’s\nfly would leave him and his luggage in the street of Castagneto. Mrs.\nFisher disliked the arrival of Mr. Wilkins, and was sure that anybody\nwho could have married Mrs. Wilkins must be at least of an injudicious\ndisposition, but a husband, whatever his disposition, should be\nproperly met. Mr. Fisher had always been properly met. Never once in\nhis married life had he gone unmet at a station, nor had he ever not\nbeen seen off. These observances, these courtesies, strengthened the\nbonds of marriage, and made the husband feel he could rely on his\nwife’s being always there. Always being there was the essential secret\nfor a wife. What would have become of Mr. Fisher if she had neglected\nto act on this principle she preferred not to think. Enough things\nbecame of him as it was; for whatever one’s care in stopping up,\nmarried life yet seemed to contain chinks."

  "content": "But Mrs. Wilkins took no pains. She just walked down the hill\nsinging—Mrs. Fisher could hear her—and picked up her husband in the\nstreet as casually as if he were a pin. The three others, still in bed,\nfor it was not nearly time to get up, heard her as she passed beneath\ntheir windows down the zigzag path to meet Mr. Wilkins, who was coming\nby the morning train, and Scrap smiled, and Rose sighed, and Mrs.\nFisher rang her bell and desired Francesca to bring her her breakfast\nin her room. All three had breakfast that day in their rooms, moved by\na common instinct to take cover.Scrap always breakfasted in bed, but she had the same instinct for\ncover, and during breakfast she made plans for spending the whole day\nwhere she was. Perhaps, though, it wouldn’t be as necessary that day as\nthe next. That day, Scrap calculated, Mellersh would be provided for.\nHe would want to have a bath, and having a bath at San Salvatore was an\nelaborate business, a real adventure if one had a hot one in the\nbathroom, and it took a lot of time. It involved the attendance of the\nentire staff—Domenico and the boy Giuseppe coaxing the patent stove to\nburn, restraining it when it burnt too fiercely, using the bellows to\nit when it threatened to go out, relighting it when it did go out;\nFrancesca anxiously hovering over the tap regulating its trickle,\nbecause if it were turned on too full the water instantly ran cold, and\nif not full enough the stove blew up inside and mysteriously flooded\nthe house; and Costanza and Angela running up and down bringing pails\nof hot water from the kitchen to eke out what the tap did.This bath had been put in lately, and was at once the pride and the\nterror of the servants. It was very patent. Nobody quite understood it.\nThere were long printed instructions as to its right treatment hanging\non the wall, in which the word _pericoloso_ recurred. When Mrs. Fisher,\nproceeding on her arrival to the bathroom, saw this word, she went back\nto her room again and ordered a sponge-bath instead; and when the\nothers found what using the bathroom meant, and how reluctant the\nservants were to leave them alone with the stove, and how Francesca\npositively refused to, and stayed with her back turned watching the\ntap, and how the remaining servants waited anxiously outside the door\ntill the bather came safely out again, they too had sponge-baths\nbrought into their rooms instead."

  "content": "Mr. Wilkins, however, was a man, and would be sure to want a big bath.\nHaving it, Scrap calculated, would keep him busy for a long while. Then\nhe would unpack, and then, after his night in the train, he would\nprobably sleep till the evening. So would he be provided for the whole\nof that day, and not be let loose on them till dinner.Therefore Scrap came to the conclusion she would be quite safe in the\ngarden that day, and got up as usual after breakfast, and dawdled as\nusual through her dressing, listening with a slightly cocked ear to\nthe sounds of Mr. Wilkins’s arrival, of his luggage being carried into\nLotty’s room on the other side of the landing, of his educated voice\nas he inquired of Lotty, first, “Do I give this fellow anything?” and\nimmediately afterwards, “Can I have a hot bath?”—of Lotty’s voice\ncheerfully assuring him that he needn’t give the fellow anything\nbecause he was the gardener, and that yes, he could have a hot bath;\nand soon after this the landing was filled with the familiar noises of\nwood being brought, of water being brought, of feet running, of tongues\nvociferating—in fact, with the preparation of the bath.Scrap finished dressing, and then loitered at her window, waiting till\nshe should hear Mr. Wilkins go into the bathroom. When he was safely\nthere she would slip out and settle herself in her garden and resume\nher inquiries into the probable meaning of her life. She was getting on\nwith her inquiries. She dozed much less frequently, and was beginning\nto be inclined to agree that tawdry was the word to apply to her past.\nAlso she was afraid that her future looked black.There—she could hear Mr. Wilkins’s educated voice again. Lotty’s door\nhad opened, and he was coming out of it asking his way to the bathroom.“It’s where you see the crowd,” Lotty’s voice answered—still a cheerful\nvoice, Scrap was glad to notice.His steps went along the landing, and Lotty’s steps seemed to go\ndownstairs, and then there seemed to be a brief altercation at the\nbathroom door—hardly so much an altercation as a chorus of\nvociferations on one side and a wordless determination, Scrap judged, to\nhave a bath by oneself on the other."

He\nfirmly closed the door on the servants, resisting Domenico, who tried\nto the last to press through, and locked himself in as a man should for\nhis bath, judicially considering, as he made his simple preparations\nfor getting in, the singular standard of behaviour of these foreigners\nwho, both male and female, apparently wished to stay with him while\nhe bathed. In Finland, he had heard, the female natives not only\nwere present on such occasions but actually washed the bath-taking\ntraveller. He had not heard, however, that this was true too of Italy,\nwhich somehow seemed much nearer civilisation—perhaps because one went\nthere, and did not go to Finland.Impartially examining this reflection, and carefully balancing the\nclaims to civilisation of Italy and Finland, Mr. Wilkins got into the\nbath and turned off the tap. Naturally he turned off the tap. It was\nwhat one did. But on the instructions, printed in red letters, was a\nparagraph saying that the tap should not be turned off as long as there\nwas still fire in the stove. It should be left on—not much on, but\non—until the fire was quite out; otherwise, and here again was the word\n_pericoloso_, the stove would blow up.Mr. Wilkins got into the bath, turned off the tap, and the stove blew\nup, exactly as the printed instructions said it would. It blew up,\nfortunately, only in its inside, but it blew up with a terrific noise,\nand Mr. Wilkins leapt out of the bath and rushed to the door, and only\nthe instinct born of years of training made him snatch up a towel as he\nrushed.Scrap, half-way across the landing on her way out of doors, heard the\nexplosion.“Good heavens,” she thought, remembering the instructions, “there goes\nMr. Wilkins!”And she ran toward the head of the stairs to call the servants, and as\nshe ran, out ran Mr. Wilkins clutching his towel, and they ran into\neach other.“That damned bath!” cried Mr. Wilkins, perhaps for the only time in his\nlife forgetting himself; but he was upset.Here was an introduction. Mr Wilkins, imperfectly concealed in his\ntowel, his shoulders exposed at one end and his legs at the other, and\nLady Caroline Dester, to meet whom he had swallowed all his anger with\nhis wife and come out to Italy."

Lotty had merely said,\n“There are two other women here, Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline Dester,”\nbut that was enough. He knew all about the Droitwiches, their wealth,\ntheir connections, their place in history, and the power they had,\nshould they choose to exert it, of making yet another solicitor happy\nby adding him to those they already employed. Some people employed one\nsolicitor for one branch of their affairs, and another for another. The\naffairs of the Droitwiches must have many branches. He had also\nheard—for it was, he considered, part of his business to hear, and\nhaving heard to remember—of the beauty of their only daughter. Even if\nthe Droitwiches themselves did not need his services, their daughter\nmight. Beauty led one into strange situations; advice could never come\namiss. And should none of them, neither parents nor daughter nor any of\ntheir brilliant sons, need him in his professional capacity, it yet was\nobviously a most valuable acquaintance to make. It opened up vistas. It\nswelled with possibilities. He might go on living in Hampstead for\nyears, and not again come across such another chance.Directly his wife’s letter reached him he telegraphed and packed. This\nwas business. He was not a man to lose time when it came to business;\nnor was he a man to jeopardise a chance by neglecting to be amiable. He\nmet his wife perfectly amiably, aware that amiability under such\ncircumstances was wisdom. Besides, he actually felt amiable—very. For\nonce, Lotty was really helping him. He kissed her affectionately on\ngetting out of Beppo’s fly, and was afraid she must have got up\nextremely early; he made no complaints of the steepness of the walk up;\nhe told her pleasantly of his journey, and when called upon, obediently\nadmired the views. It was all neatly mapped out in his mind, what he\nwas going to do that first day—have a shave, have a bath, put on clean\nclothes, sleep a while, and then would come lunch and the introduction\nto Lady Caroline.In the train he had selected the words of his greeting, going over them\nwith care—some slight expression of his gratification in meeting one of\nwhom he, in common with the whole world, had heard—but of course put\ndelicately, very delicately; some slight reference to her distinguished\nparents and the part her family had played in the history of\nEngland—made, of course, with proper tact; a sentence or two about her\neldest brother Lord Winchcombe, who had won his V.C. in the late war\nunder circumstances which could only cause—he might or might not add\nthis—every Englishman’s heart to beat higher than ever with pride, and\nthe first steps towards what might well be the turning-point in his\ncareer would have been taken."

While as for\nthe towel—why had he come? Why had he not stayed in Hampstead? It would\nbe impossible to live this down.But Mr. Wilkins was reckoning without Scrap. She, indeed, screwed up\nher face at the first flash of him on her astonished sight in an\nenormous effort not to laugh, and having choked the laughter down and\ngot her face serious again, she said as composedly as if he had had all\nhis clothes on, “How do you do.”What perfect tact. Mr. Wilkins could have worshipped her. This\nexquisite ignoring. Blue blood, of course, coming out.Overwhelmed with gratitude he took her offered hand and said “How do\nyou do,” in his turn, and merely to repeat the ordinary words seemed\nmagically to restore the situation to the normal. Indeed, he was so\nmuch relieved, and it was so natural to be shaking hands, to be\nconventionally greeting, that he forgot he had only a towel on and his\nprofessional manner came back to him. He forgot what he was looking\nlike, but he did not forget that this was Lady Caroline Dester, the\nlady he had come all the way to Italy to see, and he did not forget\nthat it was in her face, her lovely and important face, that he had\nflung his terrible exclamation. He must at once entreat her\nforgiveness. To say such a word to a lady—to any lady, but of all\nladies to just this one . . .“I’m afraid I used unpardonable language,” began Mr. Wilkins very\nearnestly, as earnestly and ceremoniously as if he had had his clothes\non.“I thought it most appropriate,” said Scrap, who was used to damns.Mr. Wilkins was incredibly relieved and soothed by this answer. No\noffence, then, taken. Blue blood again. Only blue blood could afford\nsuch a liberal, such an understanding attitude.“It is Lady Caroline Dester, is it not, to whom I am speaking?” he\nasked, his voice sounding even more carefully cultivated than usual,\nfor he had to restrain too much pleasure, too much relief, too much of\nthe joy of the pardoned and the shriven from getting into it."

She hadn’t meant to smile at Mr. Wilkins, not\never; but really he looked—and then his voice on the top of the rest\nof him, oblivious of the towel and his legs, and talking just like a\nchurch.“Allow me to introduce myself,” said Mr. Wilkins, with the ceremony of\nthe drawing-room. “My name is Mellersh-Wilkins.”And he instinctively held out his hand a second time at the words.“I thought perhaps it was,” said Scrap, a second time having hers\nshaken and a second time unable not to smile.He was about to proceed to the first of the graceful tributes he had\nprepared in the train, oblivious, as he could not see himself, that he\nwas without his clothes, when the servants came running up the stairs\nand, simultaneously, Mrs. Fisher appeared in the doorway of her\nsitting-room. For all this had happened very quickly, and the servants\naway in the kitchen, and Mrs. Fisher pacing her battlements, had not\nhad time on hearing the noise to appear before the second handshake.The servants when they heard the dreaded noise knew at once what had\nhappened, and rushed straight into the bathroom to try and staunch the\nflood, taking no notice of the figure on the landing in the towel, but\nMrs. Fisher did not know what the noise could be, and coming out of her\nroom to inquire stood rooted on the door-sill.It was enough to root anybody. Lady Caroline shaking hands with what\nevidently, if he had had clothes on, would have been Mrs. Wilkins’s\nhusband, and both of them conversing just as if—Then Scrap became aware of Mrs. Fisher. She turned to her at once. “Do\nlet me,” she said gracefully, “introduce Mr. Mellersh-Wilkins. He has\njust come. This,” she added, turning to Mr. Wilkins, “is Mrs. Fisher.”And Mr. Wilkins, nothing if not courteous, reacted at once to the\nconventional formula. First he bowed to the elderly lady in the\ndoorway, then he crossed over to her, his wet feet leaving footprints\nas he went, and having got to her he politely held out his hand.“It is a pleasure,” said Mr. Wilkins in his carefully modulated voice,\n“to meet a friend of my wife’s.”Scrap melted away down into the garden.Chapter 15"

  "content": "The strange effect of this incident was that when they met that evening\nat dinner both Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline had a singular feeling of\nsecret understanding with Mr. Wilkins. He could not be to them as other\nmen. He could not be to them as he would have been if they had met him\nin his clothes. There was a sense of broken ice; they felt at once\nintimate and indulgent; almost they felt to him as nurses do—as those\nfeel who have assisted either patients or young children at their\nbaths. They were acquainted with Mr. Wilkins’s legs.What Mrs. Fisher said to him that morning in her first shock will never\nbe known, but what Mr. Wilkins said to her in reply, when reminded by\nwhat she was saying of his condition, was so handsome in its apology,\nso proper in its confusion, that she had ended by being quite sorry for\nhim and completely placated. After all, it was an accident, and nobody\ncould help accidents. And when she saw him next at dinner, dressed,\npolished, spotless as to linen and sleek as to hair, she felt this\nsingular sensation of a secret understanding with him and, added to it,\nof a kind of almost personal pride in his appearance, now that he was\ndressed, which presently extended in some subtle way to an almost\npersonal pride in everything he said.There was no doubt whatever in Mrs. Fisher’s mind that a man was\ninfinitely preferable as a companion to a woman. Mr. Wilkins’s presence\nand conversation at once raised the standard of the dinner-table from\nthat of a bear garden—yes, a bear garden—to that of a civilised social\ngathering. He talked as men talk, about interesting subjects, and,\nthough most courteous to Lady Caroline, showed no traces of dissolving\ninto simpers and idiocy whenever he addressed her. He was, indeed,\nprecisely as courteous to Mrs. Fisher herself; and when for the first\ntime at that table politics were introduced, he listened to her with\nthe proper seriousness on her exhibiting a desire to speak, and treated\nher opinions with the attention they deserved. He appeared to think\nmuch as she did about Lloyd George, and in regard to literature he was\nequally sound. In fact there was real conversation, and he liked nuts.\nHow he could have married Mrs. Wilkins was a mystery."

It was not only that he was\npleasant at dinner, for she had always seen him pleasant at dinners\nwith other people, but he had been pleasant all day privately—so\npleasant that he had complimented her on her looks while she was\nbrushing out her hair, and kissed her. Kissed her! And it was neither\ngood-morning nor good-night.Well, this being so, she would put off telling him the truth about her\nnest-egg, and about Rose not being his hostess after all, till next\nday. Pity to spoil things. She had been going to blurt it out as soon\nas he had had a rest, but it did seem a pity to disturb such a very\nbeautiful frame of mind as that of Mellersh this first day. Let him too\nget more firmly fixed in heaven. Once fixed he wouldn’t mind anything.Her face sparkled with delight at the instantaneous effect of San\nSalvatore. Even the catastrophe of the bath, of which she had been told\nwhen she came in from the garden, had not shaken him. Of course all\nthat he had needed was a holiday. What a brute she had been to him when\nhe wanted to take her himself to Italy. But this arrangement, as it\nhappened, was ever so much better, though not through any merit of\nhers. She talked and laughed gaily, not a shred of fear of him left in\nher, and even when she said, struck by his spotlessness, that he looked\nso clean that one could eat one’s dinner off him, and Scrap laughed,\nMellersh laughed too. He would have minded that at home, supposing that\nat home she had had the spirit to say it."

  "content": "It was a successful evening. Scrap, whenever she looked at Mr. Wilkins,\nsaw him in his towel, dripping water, and felt indulgent. Mrs. Fisher\nwas delighted with him. Rose was a dignified hostess in Mr. Wilkins’s\neyes, quiet and dignified, and he admired the way she waived her right\nto preside at the head of the table—as a graceful compliment, of\ncourse, to Mrs. Fisher’s age. Mrs. Arbuthnot was, opined Mr. Wilkins,\nnaturally retiring. She was the most retiring of the three ladies. He\nhad met her before dinner alone for a moment in the drawing-room, and\nhad expressed in appropriate language his sense of her kindness in\nwishing him to join her party, and she had been retiring. Was she shy?\nProbably. She had blushed, and murmured as if in deprecation, and then\nthe others had come in. At dinner she talked least. He would, of\ncourse, become better acquainted with her during the next few days, and\nit would be a pleasure, he was sure.Meanwhile Lady Caroline was all and more than all Mr. Wilkins had\nimagined, and had received his speeches, worked in skilfully between\nthe courses, graciously; Mrs. Fisher was the exact old lady he had been\nhoping to come across all his professional life; and Lotty had not only\nimmensely improved, but was obviously _au mieux_—Mr. Wilkins knew what\nwas necessary in French—with Lady Caroline. He had been much tormented\nduring the day by the thought of how he had stood conversing with Lady\nCaroline forgetful of his not being dressed, and had at last written\nher a note most deeply apologising, and beseeching her to overlook his\namazing, his incomprehensible obliviousness, to which she had replied\nin pencil on the back of the envelope, “Don’t worry.” And he had obeyed\nher commands, and had put it from him. The result was he was now in\ngreat contentment. Before going to sleep that night he pinched his\nwife’s ear. She was amazed. These endearments . . .What is more, the morning brought no relapse in Mr. Wilkins, and he\nkept up to this high level throughout the day, in spite of its being\nthe first day of the second week, and therefore pay day."

  "content": "Its being pay day precipitated Lotty’s confession, which she had, when\nit came to the point, been inclined to put off a little longer. She was\nnot afraid, she dared anything, but Mellersh was in such an admirable\nhumour—why risk clouding it just yet? When, however, soon after\nbreakfast Costanza appeared with a pile of very dirty little bits of\npaper covered with sums in pencil, and having knocked at Mrs. Fisher’s\ndoor and been sent away, and at Lady Caroline’s door and been sent\naway, and at Rose’s door and had no answer because Rose had gone out,\nshe waylaid Lotty, who was showing Mellersh over the house, and pointed\nto the bits of paper and talked very rapidly and loud, and shrugged her\nshoulders a great deal, and kept on pointing at the bits of paper,\nLotty remembered that a week had passed without anybody paying anything\nto anyone, and that the moment had come to settle up.“Does this good lady want something?” inquired Mr. Wilkins\nmellifluously.“Money,” said Lotty.“Money?”“It’s the housekeeping bills.”“Well, you have nothing to do with those,” said Mr. Wilkins serenely.“Oh yes, I have—”And the confession was precipitated.It was wonderful how Mellersh took it. One would have imagined that his\nsole idea about the nest-egg had always been that it should be lavished\non just this. He did not, as he would have done at home, cross-examine\nher; he accepted everything as it came pouring out, about her fibs and\nall, and when she had finished and said, “You have every right to be\nangry, I think, but I hope you won’t be and will forgive me instead,”\nhe merely asked, “What can be more beneficial than such a holiday?”Whereupon she put her arm through his and held it tight and said, “Oh,\nMellersh, you really are too sweet!”—her face red with pride in him.That he should so quickly assimilate the atmosphere, that he should at\nonce become nothing but kindness, showed surely what a real affinity he\nhad with good and beautiful things. He belonged quite naturally in this\nplace of heavenly calm. He was—extraordinary how she had misjudged\nhim—by nature a child of light. Fancy not minding the dreadful fibs she\nhad gone in for before leaving home; fancy passing even those over\nwithout comment. Wonderful. Yet not wonderful, for wasn’t he in heaven?\nIn heaven nobody minded any of those done-with things, one didn’t even\ntrouble to forgive and forget, one was much too happy. She pressed his\narm tight in her gratitude and appreciation; and though he did not\nwithdraw his, neither did he respond to her pressure. Mr. Wilkins was\nof a cool habit, and rarely had any real wish to press."

  "content": "Meanwhile, Costanza, perceiving that she had lost the Wilkinses’ ear\nhad gone back to Mrs. Fisher, who at least understood Italian, besides\nbeing clearly in the servants’ eyes the one of the party marked down by\nage and appearance to pay the bills; and to her, while Mrs. Fisher put\nthe final touches to her toilette, for she was preparing, by means of\nputting on a hat and veil and feather boa and gloves, to go for her\nfirst stroll in the lower garden—positively her first since her\narrival—she explained that unless she was given money to pay the last\nweek’s bills the shops of Castagneto would refuse credit for the\ncurrent week’s food. Not even credit would they give, affirmed\nCostanza, who had been spending a great deal and was anxious to pay all\nher relations what was owed them and also to find out how her\nmistresses took it, for that day’s meals. Soon it would be the hour of\n_colazione_, and how could there be _colazione_ without meat, without\nfish, without eggs, without—Mrs. Fisher took the bills out of her hand and looked at the total; and\nshe was so much astonished by its size, so much horrified by the\nextravagance to which it testified, that she sat down at her\nwriting-table to go into the thing thoroughly.Costanza had a very bad half-hour. She had not supposed it was in the\nEnglish to be so mercenary. And then _la Vecchia_, as she was called in\nthe kitchen, knew so much Italian, and with a doggedness that filled\nCostanza with shame on her behalf, for such conduct was the last one\nexpected from the noble English, she went through item after item,\nrequiring and persisting till she got them, explanations.There were no explanations, except that Costanza had had one glorious\nweek of doing exactly as she chose, of splendid unbridled licence, and\nthat this was the result.Costanza, having no explanations, wept. It was miserable to think she\nwould have to cook from now on under watchfulness, under suspicion; and\nwhat would her relations say when they found the orders they received\nwere whittled down? They would say she had no influence; they would\ndespise her.Costanza wept, but Mrs. Fisher was unmoved. In slow and splendid\nItalian, with the roll of the cantos of the _Inferno_, she informed her\nthat she would pay no bills till the following week, and that meanwhile\nthe food was to be precisely as good as ever, and at a quarter the\ncost.Costanza threw up her hands.Next week, proceeded Mrs. Fisher unmoved, if she found this had been so\nshe would pay the whole. Otherwise—she paused; for what she would do\notherwise she did not know herself. But she paused and looked\nimpenetrable, majestic and menacing, and Costanza was cowed."

She had been under the impression that\nLady Caroline ordered the meals and therefore was responsible for the\nprices, but now it appeared that the cook had been left to do exactly\nas she pleased ever since they got there, which of course was simply\ndisgraceful.Scrap was not in her bedroom, but the room, on Mrs. Fisher’s opening\nthe door, for she suspected her of being in it and only pretending not\nto hear the knock, was still flowerlike from her presence.“Scent,” sniffed Mrs. Fisher, shutting it again; and she wished Carlyle\ncould have had five minutes’ straight talk with this young woman. And\nyet—perhaps even he—She went downstairs to go into the garden in search of her, and in the\nhall encountered Mr. Wilkins. He had his hat on, and was lighting a\ncigar.Indulgent as Mrs. Fisher felt towards Mr. Wilkins, and peculiarly and\neven mystically related after the previous morning’s encounter, she yet\ncould not like a cigar in the house. Out of doors she endured it, but\nit was not necessary, when out of doors was such a big place, to\nindulge the habit indoors. Even Mr. Fisher, who had been, she should\nsay, a man originally tenacious of habits, had quite soon after\nmarriage got out of this one.However, Mr. Wilkins, snatching off his hat on seeing her, instantly\nthrew the cigar away. He threw it into the water a great jar of arum\nlilies presumably contained, and Mrs. Fisher, aware of the value men\nattach to their newly-lit cigars, could not but be impressed by this\nimmediate and magnificent _amende honorable_.But the cigar did not reach the water. It got caught in the lilies, and\nsmoked on by itself among them, a strange and depraved-looking object.“Where are you going to, my prett—” began Mr. Wilkins, advancing\ntowards Mrs. Fisher; but he broke off just in time."

What could have put it, at such a moment, into his\nself-possessed head? He felt great respect for Mrs. Fisher, and would\nnot for the world have insulted her by addressing her as a maid, pretty\nor otherwise. He wished to stand well with her. She was a woman of\nparts, and also, he suspected, of property. At breakfast they had been\nmost pleasant together, and he had been struck by her apparent intimacy\nwith well-known persons. Victorians, of course; but it was restful to\ntalk about them after the strain of his brother-in-law’s Georgian\nparties on Hampstead Heath. He and she were getting on famously, he\nfelt. She already showed all the symptoms of presently wishing to\nbecome a client. Not for the world would he offend her. He turned a\nlittle cold at the narrowness of his escape.She had not, however, noticed.“You are going out,” he said very politely, all readiness should she\nconfirm his assumption to accompany her.“I want to find Lady Caroline,” said Mrs. Fisher, going towards the\nglass door leading into the top garden.“An agreeable quest,” remarked Mr. Wilkins. “May I assist in the\nsearch? Allow me—” he added, opening the door for her.“She usually sits over in that corner behind the bushes,” said Mrs.\nFisher. “And I don’t know about it being an agreeable quest. She has\nbeen letting the bills run up in the most terrible fashion, and needs a\ngood scolding.”“Lady Caroline?” said Mr. Wilkins, unable to follow such an attitude.\n“What has Lady Caroline, if I may inquire, to do with the bills here?”“The housekeeping was left to her, and as we all share alike it ought\nto have been a matter of honour with her—”“But—Lady Caroline housekeeping for the party here? A party which\nincludes my wife? My dear lady, you render me speechless. Do you not\nknow she is the daughter of the Droitwiches?”“Oh, is that who she is,” said Mrs. Fisher, scrunching heavily over the\npebbles towards the hidden corner. “Well, that accounts for it. The\nmuddle that man Droitwich made in his department in the war was a\nnational scandal. It amounted to misappropriation of the public funds.”“But it is impossible, I assure you, to expect the daughter of the\nDroitwiches—” began Mr. Wilkins earnestly.“The Droitwiches,” interrupted Mrs. Fisher, “are neither here nor\nthere. Duties undertaken should be performed. I don’t intend my money\nto be squandered for the sake of any Droitwiches.”"

Only the consciousness of great wealth would\nmake her snap her fingers in this manner at the Droitwiches. Lotty, on\nbeing questioned, had been vague about her circumstances, and had\ndescribed her house as a mausoleum with gold-fish swimming about in it;\nbut now he was sure she was more than very well off. Still, he wished\nhe had not joined her at this moment, for he had no sort of desire to\nbe present at such a spectacle as the scolding of Lady Caroline Dester.Again, however, he was reckoning without Scrap. Whatever she felt when\nshe looked up and beheld Mr. Wilkins discovering her corner on the very\nfirst morning, nothing but angelicness appeared on her face. She took\nher feet off the parapet on Mrs. Fisher’s sitting down on it, and\nlistening gravely to her opening remarks as to her not having any money\nto fling about in reckless and uncontrolled household expenditure,\ninterrupted her flow by pulling one of the cushions from behind her\nhead and offering it to her.“Sit on this,” said Scrap, holding it out. “You’ll be more\ncomfortable.”Mr. Wilkins leapt to relieve her of it.“Oh, thanks,” said Mrs. Fisher, interrupted.It was difficult to get into the swing again. Mr. Wilkins inserted the\ncushion solicitously between the slightly raised Mrs. Fisher and the\nstone of the parapet, and again she had to say “Thanks.” It was\ninterrupted. Besides, Lady Caroline said nothing in her defence; she\nonly looked at her, and listened with the face of an attentive angel.It seemed to Mr. Wilkins that it must be difficult to scold a Dester\nwho looked like that and so exquisitely said nothing. Mrs. Fisher, he\nwas glad to see, gradually found it difficult herself, for her severity\nslackened, and she ended by saying lamely, “You ought to have told me\nyou were not doing it.”“I didn’t know you thought I was,” said the lovely voice.“I would now like to know,” said Mrs. Fisher, “what you propose to do\nfor the rest of the time here.”“Nothing,” said Scrap, smiling.“Nothing? Do you mean to say—”“If I may be allowed, ladies,” interposed Mr. Wilkins in his suavest\nprofessional manner, “to make a suggestion”—they both looked at him,\nand remembering him as they first saw him felt indulgent—“I would\nadvise you not to spoil a delightful holiday with worries over\nhousekeeping.”“Exactly,” said Mrs. Fisher. “It is what I intend to avoid.”"
