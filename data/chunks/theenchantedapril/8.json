Tired\nof staying in her bedroom she thought she would go on to Mrs. Fisher’s\nbattlements, which would be empty at this hour, and watch the moon rise\nout of the sea.She went into the deserted upper hall with this intention, but was\nattracted on her way along it by the firelight shining through the open\ndoor of the drawing-room.How gay it looked. The fire transformed the room. A dark, ugly room in\nthe daytime, it was transformed just as she had been transformed by the\nwarmth of—no, she wouldn’t be silly; she would think of the poor; the\nthought of them always brought her down to sobriety at once.She peeped in. Firelight and flowers; and outside the deep slits of\nwindows hung the blue curtain of the night. How pretty. What a sweet\nplace San Salvatore was. And that gorgeous lilac on the table—she must\ngo and put her face in it . . .But she never got to the lilac. She went one step towards it, and then\nstood still, for she had seen the figure looking out of the window in\nthe farthest corner, and it was Frederick.All the blood in Rose’s body rushed to her heart and seemed to stop its\nbeating.Frederick. Come.She stood quite still. He had not heard her. He did not turn round. She\nstood looking at him. The miracle had happened, and he had come.She stood holding her breath. So he needed her, for he had come\ninstantly. So he too must have been thinking, longing . . .Her heart, which had seemed to stop beating, was suffocating her now,\nthe way it raced along. Frederick did love her then—he must love her,\nor why had he come? Something, perhaps her absence, had made him turn\nto her, want her . . . and now the understanding she had made up her\nmind to have with him would be quite—would be quite—easy—Her thoughts wouldn’t go on. Her mind stammered. She couldn’t think.\nShe could only see and feel. She didn’t know how it had happened. It\nwas a miracle. God could do miracles. God had done this one. God\ncould—God could—could—Her mind stammered again, and broke off.“Frederick—” she tried to say; but no sound came, or if it did the\ncrackling of the fire covered it up.She must go nearer. She began to creep towards him—softly, softly."

Suppose\nhe—suppose he—oh, but he had come, he had come.She went on again, close up to him, and her heart beat so loud that she\nthought he must hear it. And couldn’t he feel—didn’t he know—“Frederick,” she whispered, hardly able even to whisper, choked by the\nbeating of her heart.He spun round on his heels.“Rose!” he exclaimed, staring blankly.But she did not see his stare, for her arms were round his neck, and\nher cheek was against his, and she was murmuring, her lips on his ear,\n“I knew you would come—in my very heart I always, always knew you would\ncome—”Chapter 21Now Frederick was not the man to hurt anything if he could help it;\nbesides, he was completely bewildered. Not only was his wife here—here,\nof all places in the world—but she was clinging to him as she had not\nclung for years, and murmuring love, and welcoming him. If she welcomed\nhim she must have been expecting him. Strange as this was, it was the\nonly thing in the situation which was evident—that, and the softness of\nher cheek against his, and the long-forgotten sweet smell of her.Frederick was bewildered. But not being the man to hurt anything if he\ncould help it he too put his arms round her, and having put them round\nher he also kissed her; and presently he was kissing her almost as\ntenderly as she was kissing him; and presently he was kissing her quite\nas tenderly; and again presently he was kissing her more tenderly, and\njust as if he had never left off."

  "content": "He was bewildered, but he still could kiss. It seemed curiously natural\nto be doing it. It made him feel as if he were thirty again instead of\nforty, and Rose were his Rose of twenty, the Rose he had so much adored\nbefore she began to weigh what he did with her idea of right, and the\nbalance went against him, and she had turned strange, and stony, and\nmore and more shocked, and oh, so lamentable. He couldn’t get at her in\nthose days at all; she wouldn’t, she couldn’t understand. She kept on\nreferring everything to what she called God’s eyes—in God’s eyes it\ncouldn’t be right, it wasn’t right. Her miserable face—whatever her\nprinciples did for her they didn’t make her happy—her little miserable\nface, twisted with effort to be patient, had been at last more than he\ncould bear to see, and he had kept away as much as he could. She never\nought to have been the daughter of a low-church rector—narrow devil;\nshe was quite unfitted to stand up against such an upbringing.What had happened, why she was here, why she was his Rose again, passed\nhis comprehension; and meanwhile, and until such time as he understood,\nhe still could kiss. In fact he could not stop kissing; and it was he\nnow who began to murmur, to say love things in her ear under the hair\nthat smelt so sweet and tickled him just as he remembered it used to\ntickle him.And as he held her close to his heart and her arms were soft round his\nneck, he felt stealing over him a delicious sense of—at first he didn’t\nknow what it was, this delicate, pervading warmth, and then he\nrecognised it as security. Yes; security. No need now to be ashamed of\nhis figure, and to make jokes about it so as to forestall other\npeople’s and show he didn’t mind it; no need now to be ashamed of\ngetting hot going up hills, or to torment himself with pictures of how\nhe probably appeared to beautiful young women—how middle-aged, how\nabsurd in his inability to keep away from them. Rose cared nothing for\nsuch things. With her he was safe. To her he was her lover, as he used\nto be; and she would never notice or mind any of the ignoble changes\nthat getting older had made in him and would go on making more and\nmore."

  "content": "Frederick continued, therefore, with greater and greater warmth and\ngrowing delight to kiss his wife, and the mere holding of her in\nhis arms caused him to forget everything else. How could he, for\ninstance, remember or think of Lady Caroline, to mention only one of\nthe complications with which his situation bristled, when here was his\nsweet wife, miraculously restored to him, whispering with her cheek\nagainst his in the dearest, most romantic words how much she loved him,\nhow terribly she had missed him? He did for one brief instant, for even\nin moments of love there are brief instants of lucid thought, recognise\nthe immense power of the woman present and being actually held compared\nto that of the woman, however beautiful, who is somewhere else, but\nthat is as far as he got towards remembering Scrap; no farther. She was\nlike a dream, fleeing before the morning light.“When did you start?” murmured Rose, her mouth on his ear. She couldn’t\nlet him go; not even to talk she couldn’t let him go.“Yesterday morning,” murmured Frederick, holding her close. He couldn’t\nlet her go either.“Oh—the very instant then,” murmured Rose.This was cryptic, but Frederick said, “Yes, the very instant,” and\nkissed her neck.“How quickly my letter got to you,” murmured Rose, whose eyes were shut\nin the excess of her happiness.“Didn’t it,” said Frederick, who felt like shutting his eyes himself.So there had been a letter. Soon, no doubt, light would be vouchsafed\nhim, and meanwhile this was so strangely, touchingly sweet, this\nholding his Rose to his heart again after all the years, that he\ncouldn’t bother to try to guess anything. Oh, he had been happy during\nthese years, because it was not in him to be unhappy; besides, how many\ninterests life had had to offer him, how many friends, how much\nsuccess, how many women only too willing to help him to blot out the\nthought of the altered, petrified, pitiful little wife at home who\nwouldn’t spend his money, who was appalled by his books, who drifted\naway and away from him, and always if he tried to have it out with her\nasked him with patient obstinacy what he thought the things he wrote\nand lived by looked in the eyes of God. “No one,” she said once,\n“should ever write a book God wouldn’t like to read. That is the test,\nFrederick.” And he had laughed hysterically, burst into a great shriek\nof laughter, and rushed out of the house, away from her solemn little\nface—away from her pathetic, solemn little face. . ."

  "content": "But this Rose was his youth again, the best part of his life, the part\nof it that had had all the visions in it and all the hopes. How they\nhad dreamed together, he and she, before he struck that vein of\nmemoirs; how they had planned, and laughed, and loved. They had lived\nfor a while in the very heart of poetry. After the happy days came the\nhappy nights, the happy, happy nights, with her asleep close against\nhis heart, with her when he woke in the morning still close against his\nheart, for they hardly moved in their deep, happy sleep. It was\nwonderful to have it all come back to him at the touch of her, at the\nfeel of her face against his—wonderful that she should be able to give\nhim back his youth.“Sweetheart—sweetheart,” he murmured, overcome by remembrance, clinging\nto her now in his turn.“Beloved husband,” she breathed—the bliss of it—the sheer bliss . . .Briggs, coming in a few minutes before the gong went on the chance that\nLady Caroline might be there, was much astonished. He had supposed Rose\nArbuthnot was a widow, and he still supposed it; so that he was much\nastonished.“Well I’m damned,” thought Briggs, quite clearly and distinctly, for\nthe shock of what he saw in the window startled him so much that for a\nmoment he was shaken free of his own confused absorption.Aloud he said, very red, “Oh I say—I beg your pardon”—and then stood\nhesitating, and wondering whether he oughtn’t to go back to his bedroom\nagain.If he had said nothing they would not have noticed he was there, but\nwhen he begged their pardon Rose turned and looked at him as one looks\nwho is trying to remember, and Frederick looked at him too without at\nfirst quite seeing him.They didn’t seem, thought Briggs, to mind or to be at all embarrassed.\nHe couldn’t be her brother; no brother ever brought that look into a\nwoman’s face. It was very awkward. If they didn’t mind, he did. It\nupset him to come across his Madonna forgetting herself.“Is this one of your friends?” Frederick was able after an instant to\nask Rose, who made no attempt to introduce the young man standing\nawkwardly in front of them but continued to gaze at him with a kind of\nabstracted, radiant goodwill.“It’s Mr. Briggs,” said Rose, recognizing him. “This is my husband,”\nshe added.And Briggs, shaking hands, just had time to think how surprising it was\nto have a husband when you were a widow before the gong sounded, and\nLady Caroline would be there in a minute, and he ceased to be able to\nthink at all, and merely became a thing with its eyes fixed on the\ndoor."

Where was she? Had she heard the gong? Oughtn’t\nit to be beaten again? Suppose she didn’t come to dinner after all. . .Briggs went cold.“Introduce me,” said Frederick on Mrs. Fisher’s entrance, touching\nRose’s elbow.“My husband,” said Rose, holding him by the hand, her face exquisite.“This,” thought Mrs. Fisher, “must now be the last of the husbands,\nunless Lady Caroline produces one from up her sleeve.”But she received him graciously, for he certainly looked exactly like a\nhusband, not at all like one of those people who go about abroad\npretending they are husbands when they are not, and said she supposed\nhe had come to accompany his wife home at the end of the month, and\nremarked that now the house would be completely full. “So that,” she\nadded, smiling at Briggs, “we shall at last really be getting our\nmoney’s worth.”Briggs grinned automatically, because he was just able to realise that\nsomebody was being playful with him, but he had not heard her and he\ndid not look at her. Not only were his eyes fixed on the door but his\nwhole body was concentrated on it.Introduced in his turn, Mr. Wilkins was most hospitable and called\nFrederick “sir.”“Well, sir,” said Mr. Wilkins heartily, “here we are, here we are”—and\nhaving gripped his hand with an understanding that only wasn’t mutual\nbecause Arbuthnot did not yet know what he was in for in the way of\ntrouble, he looked at him as a man should, squarely in the eyes, and\nallowed his look to convey as plainly as a look can that in him would\nbe found staunchness, integrity, reliability—in fact a friend in need.\nMrs. Arbuthnot was very much flushed, Mr. Wilkins noticed. He had not\nseen her flushed like that before. “Well, I’m their man,” he thought.Lotty’s greeting was effusive. It was done with both hands. “Didn’t I\ntell you?” she laughed to Rose over her shoulder while Frederick was\nshaking her hands in both his."

  "content": "“What did you tell her?” asked Frederick, in order to say something.\nThe way they were all welcoming him was confusing. They had evidently\nall expected him, not only Rose.The sandy but agreeable young woman didn’t answer his question, but\nlooked extraordinarily pleased to see him. Why should she be\nextraordinarily pleased to see him?“What a delightful place this is,” said Frederick, confused, and making\nthe first remark that occurred to him.“It’s a tub of love,” said the sandy young woman earnestly; which\nconfused him more than ever.And his confusion became excessive at the next words he heard—spoken,\nthese, by the old lady, who said: “We won’t wait. Lady Caroline is\nalways late”—for he only then, on hearing her name, really and properly\nremembered Lady Caroline, and the thought of her confused him to\nexcess.He went into the dining-room like a man in a dream. He had come out to\nthis place to see Lady Caroline, and had told her so. He had even told\nher in his fatuousness—it was true, but how fatuous—that he hadn’t been\nable to help coming. She didn’t know he was married. She thought his\nname was Arundel. Everybody in London thought his name was Arundel. He\nhad used it and written under it so long that he almost thought it was\nhimself. In the short time since she had left him on the seat in the\ngarden, where he told her he had come because he couldn’t help it, he\nhad found Rose again, had passionately embraced and been embraced, and\nhad forgotten Lady Caroline. It would be an extraordinary piece of good\nfortune if Lady Caroline’s being late meant she was tired or bored and\nwould not come to dinner at all. Then he could—no, he couldn’t. He\nturned a deeper red even than usual, he being a man of full habit and\nred anyhow, at the thought of such cowardice. No, he couldn’t go away\nafter dinner and catch his train and disappear to Rome; not unless,\nthat is, Rose came with him. But even so, what a running away. No, he\ncouldn’t."

He didn’t know;\nhe didn’t know anything—and Rose, who in her earlier days of defying\nMrs. Fisher had taken the other end as her place, for after all no one\ncould say by looking at a table which was its top and which its bottom,\nled Frederick to the seat next to her. If only, he thought, he could\nhave been alone with Rose; just five minutes more alone with Rose, so\nthat he could have asked her—But probably he wouldn’t have asked her anything, and only gone on\nkissing her.He looked round. The sandy young woman was telling the man they called\nBriggs to go and sit beside Mrs. Fisher—was the house, then, the sandy\nyoung woman’s and not Mrs. Fisher’s? He didn’t know; he didn’t know\nanything—and she herself sat down on Rose’s other side, so that she was\nopposite him, Frederick, and next to the genial man who had said “Here\nwe are,” when it was only too evident that there they were indeed.Next to Frederick, and between him and Briggs, was an empty chair: Lady\nCaroline’s. No more than Lady Caroline knew of the presence in\nFrederick’s life of Rose was Rose aware of the presence in Frederick’s\nlife of Lady Caroline. What would each think? He didn’t know; he didn’t\nknow anything. Yes, he did know something, and that was that his wife\nhad made it up with him—suddenly, miraculously, unaccountably, and\ndivinely. Beyond that he knew nothing. The situation was one with which\nhe felt he could not cope. It must lead him whither it would. He could\nonly drift.In silence Frederick ate his soup, and the eyes, the large expressive\neyes of the young woman opposite, were on him, he could feel, with a\ngrowing look in them of inquiry. They were, he could see, very\nintelligent and attractive eyes, and full, apart from the inquiry of\ngoodwill. Probably she thought he ought to talk—but if she knew\neverything she wouldn’t think so. Briggs didn’t talk either. Briggs\nseemed uneasy. What was the matter with Briggs? And Rose too didn’t\ntalk, but then that was natural. She never had been a talker. She had\nthe loveliest expression on her face. How long would it be on it after\nLady Caroline’s entrance? He didn’t know; he didn’t know anything."

I like sitting next to him. I didn’t before I came\nhere.”Frederick could think of nothing to say to this, so he only smiled\ngenerally.“It’s this place,” she said, nodding at him. “It makes one understand.\nYou’ve no idea what a lot you’ll understand before you’ve done here.”“I’m sure I hope so,” said Frederick with real fervour.The soup was taken away, and the fish was brought. Briggs, on the other\nside of the empty chair, seemed more uneasy than ever. What was the\nmatter with Briggs? Didn’t he like fish?Frederick wondered what Briggs would do in the way of fidgets if he\nwere in his own situation. Frederick kept on wiping his moustache, and\nwas not able to look up from his plate, but that was as much as he\nshowed of what he was feeling.Though he didn’t look up he felt the eyes of the young woman opposite\nraking him like searchlights, and Rose’s eyes were on him too, he knew,\nbut they rested on him unquestioningly, beautifully, like a\nbenediction. How long would they go on doing that once Lady Caroline\nwas there? He didn’t know; he didn’t know anything.He wiped his moustache for the twentieth unnecessary time, and could\nnot quite keep his hand steady, and the young woman opposite saw his\nhand not being quite steady, and her eyes raked him persistently.

The lilies, the\ndaphnes, the orange-blossom, the white stocks, the white pinks, the\nwhite roses—you could see these as plainly as in the day-time; but the\ncoloured flowers existed only as fragrance.The three younger women sat on the low wall at the end of the top\ngarden after dinner, Rose a little apart from the others, and watched\nthe enormous moon moving slowly over the place where Shelley had lived\nhis last months just on a hundred years before. The sea quivered along\nthe path of the moon. The stars winked and trembled. The mountains were\nmisty blue outlines, with little clusters of lights shining through\nfrom little clusters of homes. In the garden the plants stood quite\nstill, straight and unstirred by the smallest ruffle of air. Through\nthe glass doors the dining-room, with its candle-lit table and\nbrilliant flowers—nasturtiums and marigolds that night—glowed like some\nmagic cave of colour, and the three men smoking round it looked\nstrangely animated figures seen from the silence, the huge cool calm of\noutside."

Her face too was upturned. She was looking at the\numbrella pine, which had been smitten into something glorious,\nsilhouetted against stars. Every now and then Scrap’s eyes lingered on\nRose; so did Lotty’s. For Rose was lovely. Anywhere at that moment,\namong all the well-known beauties, she would have been lovely. Nobody\ncould have put her in the shade, blown out her light that evening; she\nwas too evidently shining.Lotty bent close to Scrap’s ear, and whispered. “Love,” she whispered.Scrap nodded. “Yes,” she said, under her breath.She was obliged to admit it. You only had to look at Rose to know that\nhere was Love.“There’s nothing like it,” whispered Lotty.Scrap was silent.“It’s a great thing,” whispered Lotty after a pause, during which they\nboth watched Rose’s upturned face, “to get on with one’s loving.\nPerhaps you can tell me of anything else in the world that works such\nwonders.”But Scrap couldn’t tell her; and if she could have, what a night to\nbegin arguing in. This was a night for—She pulled herself up. Love again. It was everywhere. There was no\ngetting away from it. She had come to this place to get away from it,\nand here was everybody in its different stages. Even Mrs. Fisher seemed\nto have been brushed by one of the many feathers of Love’s wing, and at\ndinner was different—full of concern because Mr. Briggs wouldn’t eat,\nand her face when she turned to him all soft with motherliness.Scrap looked up at the pine-tree motionless among stars. Beauty made\nyou love, and love made you beautiful. . .She pulled her wrap closer round her with a gesture of defence, of\nkeeping out and off. She didn’t want to grow sentimental. Difficult not\nto, here; the marvellous night stole in through all one’s chinks, and\nbrought in with it, whether one wanted them or not, enormous\nfeelings—feelings one couldn’t manage, great things about death and\ntime and waste; glorious and devastating things, magnificent and bleak,\nat once rapture and terror and immense, heart-cleaving longing. She\nfelt small and dreadfully alone. She felt uncovered and defenceless.\nInstinctively she pulled her wrap closer. With this thing of chiffon\nshe tried to protect herself from the eternities.“I suppose,” whispered Lotty, “Rose’s husband seems to you just an\nordinary, good-natured, middle-aged man.”Scrap brought her gaze down from the stars and looked at Lotty a moment\nwhile she focussed her mind again."

Grievously indeed did it sometimes do the\nopposite. She had had it in her life applied to her to excess. If it\nhad let her alone, if it had at least been moderate and infrequent, she\nmight, she thought, have turned out a quite decent, generous-minded,\nkindly, human being. And what was she, thanks to this love Lotty talked\nso much about? Scrap searched for a just description. She was a spoilt,\na sour, a suspicious, and a selfish spinster.The glass doors of the dining-room opened, and the three men came out\ninto the garden, Mr. Wilkins’s voice flowing along in front of them.

At\ndinner his hand shook when he drank, and he couldn’t speak to her\nwithout flushing scarlet and then going pale, and Mrs. Fisher’s eyes\nhad sought hers with the entreaty of one who asks that her only son may\nnot be hurt.How could a human being, thought Scrap, frowning as she issued forth\nfrom her corner, how could a man made in God’s image behave so; and he\nfitted for better things she was sure, with his youth, his\nattractiveness, and his brains. He had brains. She had examined him\ncautiously whenever at dinner Mrs. Fisher forced him to turn away to\nanswer her, and she was sure he had brains. Also he had character;\nthere was something noble about his head, about the shape of his\nforehead—noble and kind. All the more deplorable that he should allow\nhimself to be infatuated by a mere outside, and waste any of his\nstrength, any of his peace of mind, hanging round just a woman-thing.\nIf only he could see right through her, see through all her skin and\nstuff, he would be cured, and she might go on sitting undisturbed on\nthis wonderful night by herself.Just beyond the daphne bushes she met Frederick, hurrying.“I was determined to find you first,” he said, “before I go to Rose.”\nAnd he added quickly, “I want to kiss your shoes.”“Do you?” said Scrap, smiling. “Then I must go and put on my new ones.\nThese aren’t nearly good enough.”She felt immensely well-disposed towards Frederick. He, at least, would\ngrab no more. His grabbing days, so sudden and so brief, were done.\nNice man; agreeable man. She now definitely liked him. Clearly he had\nbeen getting into some sort of a tangle, and she was grateful to Lotty\nfor stopping her in time at dinner from saying something hopelessly\ncomplicating. But whatever he had been getting into he was out of it\nnow; his face and Rose’s face had the same light in them.“I shall adore you for ever now,” said Frederick.Scrap smiled. “Shall you?” she said.“I adored you before because of your beauty. Now I adore you because\nyou’re not only as beautiful as a dream but as decent as a man.”Scrap laughed. “Am I?” she said, amused."

  "content": "“When the impetuous young woman,” Frederick went on, “the blessedly\nimpetuous young woman, blurted out in the nick of time that I am Rose’s\nhusband, you behaved exactly as a man would have behaved to his\nfriend.”“Did I?” said Scrap, her enchanting dimple very evident.“It’s the rarest, most precious of combinations,” said Frederick, “to\nbe a woman and have the loyalty of a man.”“Is it?” smiled Scrap, a little wistfully. These were indeed handsome\ncompliments. If only she were really like that . . .“And I want to kiss your shoes.”“Won’t this save trouble?” she asked, holding out her hand.He took it and swiftly kissed it, and was hurrying away again. “Bless\nyou,” he said as he went.“Where is your luggage?” Scrap called after him.“Oh, Lord, yes—” said Frederick, pausing. “It’s at the station.”“I’ll send for it.”He disappeared through the bushes. She went indoors to give the order;\nand this is how it happened that Domenico, for the second time that\nevening, found himself journeying into Mezzago and wondering as he\nwent.Then, having made the necessary arrangements for the perfect happiness\nof these two people, she came slowly out into the garden again, very\nmuch absorbed in thought. Love seemed to bring happiness to everybody\nbut herself. It had certainly got hold of everybody there, in its\ndifferent varieties, except herself. Poor Mr. Briggs had been got hold\nof by its least dignified variety. Poor Mr. Briggs. He was a disturbing\nproblem, and his going away next day wouldn’t she was afraid solve him.When she reached the others Mr. Arundel—she kept on forgetting that he\nwasn’t Mr. Arundel—was already, his arm through Rose’s, going off with\nher, probably to the greater seclusion of the lower garden. No doubt\nthey had a great deal to say to each other; something had gone wrong\nbetween them, and had suddenly been put right. San Salvatore, Lotty\nwould say, San Salvatore working its spell of happiness. She could\nquite believe in its spell. Even she was happier there than she had\nbeen for ages and ages. The only person who would go empty away would\nbe Mr. Briggs."

  "content": "Poor Mr. Briggs. When she came in sight of the group he looked much too\nnice and boyish not to be happy. It seemed out of the picture that the\nowner of the place, the person to whom they owed all this, should be\nthe only one to go away from it unblessed.Compunction seized Scrap. What very pleasant days she had spent in his\nhouse, lying in his garden, enjoying his flowers, loving his views,\nusing his things, being comfortable, being rested—recovering, in fact.\nShe had had the most leisured, peaceful, and thoughtful time of her\nlife; and all really thanks to him. Oh, she knew she paid him some\nridiculous small sum a week, out of all proportion to the benefits she\ngot in exchange, but what was that in the balance? And wasn’t it\nentirely thanks to him that she had come across Lotty? Never else would\nshe and Lotty have met; never else would she have known her.Compunction laid its quick, warm hand on Scrap. Impulsive gratitude\nflooded her. She went straight up to Briggs.“I owe you so _much_,” she said, overcome by the sudden realisation of\nall she did owe him, and ashamed of her churlishness in the afternoon\nand at dinner. Of course he hadn’t known she was being churlish. Of\ncourse her disagreeable inside was camouflaged as usual by the chance\narrangement of her outside; but she knew it. She was churlish. She had\nbeen churlish to everybody for years. Any penetrating eye, thought\nScrap, any really penetrating eye, would see her for what she was—a\nspoilt, a sour, a suspicious and a selfish spinster.“I owe you so _much_,” therefore said Scrap earnestly, walking straight\nup to Briggs, humbled by these thoughts.He looked at her in wonder. “_You_ owe _me?_” he said. “But it’s I\nwho—I who—” he stammered. To see her there in his garden . . . nothing\nin it, no white flower, was whiter, more exquisite.“Please,” said Scrap, still more earnestly, “won’t you clear your mind\nof everything except just truth? You don’t owe me anything. How should\nyou?”“I don’t owe you anything?” echoed Briggs. “Why, I owe you my first\nsight of—of—”“Oh, for goodness sake—for _goodness_ sake,” said Scrap entreatingly,\n“do, please, be ordinary. Don’t be humble. Why should you be humble?\nIt’s ridiculous of you to be humble. You’re worth fifty of me.”"

  "content": "“Unwise,” thought Mr. Wilkins, who was standing there too, while Lotty\nsat on the wall. He was surprised, he was concerned, he was shocked\nthat Lady Caroline should thus encourage Briggs. “Unwise—very,”\nthought Mr. Wilkins, shaking his head.Briggs’s condition was so bad already that the only course to take with\nhim was to repel him utterly, Mr. Wilkins considered. No half measures\nwere the least use with Briggs, and kindliness and familiar talk would\nonly be misunderstood by the unhappy youth. The daughter of the\nDroitwiches could not really, it was impossible to suppose it, desire\nto encourage him. Briggs was all very well, but Briggs was Briggs; his\nname alone proved that. Probably Lady Caroline did not quite appreciate\nthe effect of her voice and face, and how between them they made\notherwise ordinary words seem—well, encouraging. But these words were\nnot quite ordinary; she had not, he feared, sufficiently pondered them.\nIndeed and indeed she needed an adviser—some sagacious, objective\ncounsellor like himself. There she was, standing before Briggs almost\nholding out her hands to him. Briggs of course ought to be thanked, for\nthey were having a most delightful holiday in his house, but not\nthanked to excess and not by Lady Caroline alone. That very evening he\nhad been considering the presentation to him next day of a round robin\nof collective gratitude on his departure; but he should not be thanked\nlike this, in the moonlight, in the garden, by the lady he was so\nmanifestly infatuated with.Mr. Wilkins therefore, desiring to assist Lady Caroline out of this\nsituation by swiftly applied tact, said with much heartiness: “It is\nmost proper, Briggs, that you should be thanked. You will please allow\nme to add my expressions of indebtedness, and those of my wife, to Lady\nCaroline’s. We ought to have proposed a vote of thanks to you at\ndinner. You should have been toasted. There certainly ought to have\nbeen some—”"

  "content": "But Briggs took no notice of him whatever; he simply continued to look\nat Lady Caroline as though she were the first woman he had ever seen.\nNeither, Mr. Wilkins observed, did Lady Caroline take any notice of\nhim; she too continued to look at Briggs, and with that odd air of\nalmost appeal. Most unwise. Most.Lotty, on the other hand, took too much notice of him, choosing this\nmoment when Lady Caroline needed special support and protection to get\nup off the wall and put her arm through his and draw him away.“I want to tell you something, Mellersh,” said Lotty at this juncture,\ngetting up.“Presently,” said Mr. Wilkins, waving her aside.“No—now,” said Lotty; and she drew him away.He went with extreme reluctance. Briggs should be given no rope at\nall—not an inch.“Well—what is it?” he asked impatiently, as she led him towards the\nhouse. Lady Caroline ought not to be left like that, exposed to\nannoyance.“Oh, but she isn’t,” Lotty assured him, just as if he had said this\naloud, which he certainly had not. “Caroline is perfectly all right.”“Not at all all right. That young Briggs is—”“Of course he is. What did you expect? Let’s go indoors to the fire and\nMrs. Fisher. She’s all by herself.”“I cannot,” said Mr. Wilkins, trying to draw back, “leave Lady Caroline\nalone in the garden.”“Don’t be silly, Mellersh—she isn’t alone. Besides, I want to tell you\nsomething.”“Well tell me, then.”“Indoors.”With a reluctance that increased at every step Mr. Wilkins was taken\nfarther and farther away from Lady Caroline. He believed in his wife\nnow and trusted her, but on this occasion he thought she was making a\nterrible mistake. In the drawing-room sat Mrs. Fisher by the fire, and\nit certainly was to Mr. Wilkins, who preferred rooms and fires after\ndark to gardens and moonlight, more agreeable to be in there than\nout-of-doors if he could have brought Lady Caroline safely in with him.\nAs it was, he went in with extreme reluctance."

  "content": "Mrs. Fisher, her hands folded on her lap, was doing nothing, merely\ngazing fixedly into the fire. The lamp was arranged conveniently for\nreading, but she was not reading. Her great dead friends did not seem\nworth reading that night. They always said the same things now—over and\nover again they said the same things, and nothing new was to be got out\nof them any more for ever. No doubt they were greater than any one was\nnow, but they had this immense disadvantage, that they were dead.\nNothing further was to be expected of them; while of the living, what\nmight one not still expect? She craved for the living, the\ndeveloping—the crystallised and finished wearied her. She was thinking\nthat if only she had had a son—a son like Mr. Briggs, a dear boy like\nthat, going on, unfolding, alive, affectionate, taking care of her and\nloving her. . .The look on her face gave Mrs. Wilkins’s heart a little twist when she\nsaw it. “Poor old dear,” she thought, all the loneliness of age\nflashing upon her, the loneliness of having outstayed one’s welcome in\nthe world, of being in it only on sufferance, the complete loneliness\nof the old childless woman who has failed to make friends. It did seem\nthat people could only be really happy in pairs—any sorts of pairs, not\nin the least necessarily lovers, but pairs of friends, pairs of mothers\nand children, of brothers and sisters—and where was the other half of\nMrs. Fisher’s pair going to be found?Mrs. Wilkins thought she had perhaps better kiss her again. The kissing\nthis afternoon had been a great success; she knew it, she had instantly\nfelt Mrs. Fisher’s reaction to it. So she crossed over and bent down\nand kissed her and said cheerfully, “We’ve come in—” which indeed was\nevident.This time Mrs. Fisher actually put up her hand and held Mrs. Wilkins’s\ncheek against her own—this living thing, full of affection, of warm,\nracing blood; and as she did this she felt safe with the strange\ncreature, sure that she who herself did unusual things so naturally\nwould take the action quite as a matter of course, and not embarrass\nher by being surprised.Mrs. Wilkins was not at all surprised; she was delighted. “I believe\n_I’m_ the other half of her pair,” flashed into her mind. “I believe\nit’s me, positively me, going to be fast friends with Mrs. Fisher!”Her face when she lifted her head was full of laughter. Too\nextraordinary, the developments produced by San Salvatore. She and Mrs.\nFisher . . . but she _saw_ them being fast friends.“Where are the others?” asked Mrs. Fisher. “Thank you—dear,” she added,\nas Mrs. Wilkins put a footstool under her feet, a footstool obviously\nneeded, Mrs. Fisher’s legs being short.“I see myself throughout the years,” thought Mrs. Wilkins, her eyes\ndancing, “bringing footstools to Mrs. Fisher. . .”"

And the Carolines—”Both Mr. Wilkins and Mrs. Fisher started. Mr. Wilkins, usually in such\ncomplete control of himself, started even more than Mrs. Fisher, and\nfor the first time since his arrival felt angry with his wife.“Really—” he began indignantly.“Very well, Mellersh—the Briggses, then.”“The Briggses!” cried Mr. Wilkins, now very angry indeed; for the\nimplication was to him a most outrageous insult to the entire race of\nDesters—dead Desters, living Desters, and Desters still harmless\nbecause they were yet unborn. “Really—”“I’m sorry, Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins, pretending meekness, “if you\ndon’t like it.”“Like it! You’ve taken leave of your senses. Why, they’ve never set\neyes on each other before to-day.”“That’s true. But that’s why they’re able now to go ahead.”“Go ahead!” Mr. Wilkins could only echo the outrageous words.“I’m sorry, Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins again, “if you don’t like it,\nbut—”Her grey eyes shone, and her face rippled with the light and conviction\nthat had so much surprised Rose the first time they met.“It’s useless minding,” she said. “I shouldn’t struggle if I were you.\nBecause—”She stopped, and looked first at one alarmed solemn face and then at\nthe other, and laughter as well as light flickered and danced over her.“I see them being the Briggses,” finished Mrs. Wilkins."

There were the lilies, as vigorous as ever,\nand the white stocks and white pinks and white banksia roses, and the\nsyringa and the jessamine, and at last the crowning fragrance of the\nacacias.
