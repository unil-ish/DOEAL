  "content": "Scrap smiled, and held out her cigarette case. Mrs. Fisher could not\nhelp being mollified. A way out of waste was going to be found, thanks\nto Mr. Wilkins, and she hated waste quite as much as having to pay for\nit; also a way was found out of housekeeping. For a moment she had\nthought that if everybody tried to force her into housekeeping on her\nbrief holiday by their own indifference (Lady Caroline), or inability\nto speak Italian (the other two), she would have to send for Kate\nLumley after all. Kate could do it. Kate and she had learnt Italian\ntogether. Kate would only be allowed to come on condition that she did\ndo it.But this was much better, this way of Mr. Wilkins’s. Really a most\nsuperior man. There was nothing like an intelligent, not too young man\nfor profitable and pleasurable companionship. And when she got up, the\nbusiness for which she had come being settled, and said she now\nintended to take a little stroll before lunch, Mr. Wilkins did not stay\nwith Lady Caroline, as most of the men she had known would, she was\nafraid, have wanted to—he asked to be permitted to go and stroll with\nher; so that he evidently definitely preferred conversation to faces. A\nsensible, companionable man. A clever, well-read man. A man of the\nworld. A man. She was very glad indeed she had not written to Kate the\nother day. What did she want with Kate? She had found a better\ncompanion.But Mr. Wilkins did not go with Mrs. Fisher because of her\nconversation, but because, when she got up and he got up because she\ngot up, intending merely to bow her out of the recess, Lady Caroline\nhad put her feet up on the parapet again, and arranging her head\nsideways in the cushions had shut her eyes.The daughter of the Droitwiches desired to go to sleep.It was not for him, by remaining, to prevent her.Chapter 16"

  "content": "And so the second week began, and all was harmony. The arrival of Mr.\nWilkins, instead of, as three of the party had feared and the fourth\nhad only been protected from fearing by her burning faith in the effect\non him of San Salvatore, disturbing such harmony as there was,\nincreased it. He fitted in. He was determined to please, and he did\nplease. He was most amiable to his wife—not only in public, which she\nwas used to, but in private, when he certainly wouldn’t have been if he\nhadn’t wanted to. He did want to. He was so much obliged to her, so\nmuch pleased with her, for making him acquainted with Lady Caroline,\nthat he felt really fond of her. Also proud; for there must be, he\nreflected, a good deal more in her than he had supposed, for Lady\nCaroline to have become so intimate with her and so affectionate. And\nthe more he treated her as though she were really very nice, the more\nLotty expanded and became really very nice, and the more he, affected\nin his turn, became really very nice himself; so that they went round\nand round, not in a vicious but in a highly virtuous circle.Positively, for him, Mellersh petted her. There was at no time much pet\nin Mellersh, because he was by nature a cool man; yet such was the\ninfluence on him of, as Lotty supposed, San Salvatore, that in this\nsecond week he sometimes pinched both her ears, one after the other,\ninstead of only one; and Lotty, marvelling at such rapidly developing\naffectionateness, wondered what he would do, should he continue at this\nrate, in the third week, when her supply of ears would have come to an\nend.He was particularly nice about the washstand, and genuinely desirous of\nnot taking up too much of the space in the small bedroom. Quick to\nrespond, Lotty was even more desirous not to be in his way; and the\nroom became the scene of many an affectionate _combat de générosité_,\neach of which left them more pleased with each other than ever. He did\nnot again have a bath in the bathroom, though it was mended and ready\nfor him, but got up and went down every morning to the sea, and in\nspite of the cool nights making the water cold early had his dip as a\nman should, and came up to breakfast rubbing his hands and feeling, as\nhe told Mrs. Fisher, prepared for anything.Lotty’s belief in the irresistible influence of the heavenly atmosphere\nof San Salvatore being thus obviously justified, and Mr. Wilkins, whom\nRose knew as alarming and Scrap had pictured as icily unkind, being so\nevidently a changed man, both Rose and Scrap began to think there might\nafter all be something in what Lotty insisted on, and that San\nSalvatore did work purgingly on the character."

  "content": "They were the more inclined to think so in that they too felt a working\ngoing on inside themselves: they felt more cleared, both of them, that\nsecond week—Scrap in her thoughts, many of which were now quite nice\nthoughts, real amiable ones about her parents and relations, with a\nglimmer in them of recognition of the extraordinary benefits she had\nreceived at the hands of—what? Fate? Providence?—anyhow of something,\nand of how, having received them, she had misused them by failing to be\nhappy; and Rose in her bosom, which though it still yearned, yearned to\nsome purpose, for she was reaching the conclusion that merely\ninactively to yearn was no use at all, and that she must either by some\nmeans stop her yearning or give it at least a chance—remote, but still\na chance—of being quieted by writing to Frederick and asking him to\ncome out.If Mr. Wilkins could be changed, thought Rose, why not Frederick? How\nwonderful it would be, how too wonderful, if the place worked on him\ntoo and were able to make them even a little understand each other,\neven a little be friends. Rose, so far had loosening and disintegration\ngone on in her character, now was beginning to think her obstinate\nstrait-lacedness about his books and her austere absorption in good\nworks had been foolish and perhaps even wrong. He was her husband, and\nshe had frightened him away. She had frightened love away, precious\nlove, and that couldn’t be good. Was not Lotty right when she said the\nother day that nothing at all except love mattered? Nothing certainly\nseemed much use unless it was built up on love. But once frightened\naway, could it ever come back? Yes, it might in that beauty, it might\nin the atmosphere of happiness Lotty and San Salvatore seemed between\nthem to spread round like some divine infection.She had, however, to get him there first, and he certainly couldn’t be\ngot there if she didn’t write and tell him where she was.She would write. She must write; for if she did there was at least a\nchance of his coming, and if she didn’t there was manifestly none. And\nthen, once here in this loveliness, with everything so soft and kind\nand sweet all round, it would be easier to tell him, to try and\nexplain, to ask for something different, for at least an attempt at\nsomething different in their lives in the future, instead of the\nblankness of separation, the cold—oh, the cold—of nothing at all but\nthe great windiness of faith, the great bleakness of works. Why, one\nperson in the world, one single person belonging to one, of one’s very\nown, to talk to, to take care of, to love, to be interested in, was\nworth more than all the speeches on platforms and the compliments of\nchairmen in the world. It was also worth more—Rose couldn’t help it,\nthe thought would come—than all the prayers."

  "content": "These thoughts were not head thoughts, like Scrap’s, who was altogether\nfree from yearnings, but bosom thoughts. They lodged in the bosom; it\nwas in the bosom that Rose ached, and felt so dreadfully lonely. And\nwhen her courage failed her, as it did on most days, and it seemed\nimpossible to write to Frederick, she would look at Mr. Wilkins and\nrevive.There he was, a changed man. There he was, going into that small,\nuncomfortable room every night, that room whose proximities had been\nLotty’s only misgiving, and coming out of it in the morning, and Lotty\ncoming out of it too, both of them as unclouded and as nice to each\nother as when they went in. And hadn’t he, so critical at home, Lotty\nhad told her, of the least thing going wrong, emerged from the bath\ncatastrophe as untouched in spirit as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego\nwere untouched in body when they emerged from the fire? Miracles were\nhappening in this place. If they could happen to Mr. Wilkins, why not\nto Frederick?She got up quickly. Yes, she would write. She would go and write to him\nat once.But suppose—She paused. Suppose he didn’t answer. Suppose he didn’t even answer.And she sat down again to think a little longer.In these hesitations did Rose spend most of the second week.Then there was Mrs. Fisher. Her restlessness increased that second\nweek. It increased to such an extent that she might just as well not\nhave had her private sitting-room at all, for she could no longer sit.\nNot for ten minutes together could Mrs. Fisher sit. And added to the\nrestlessness, as the days of the second week proceeded on their way,\nshe had a curious sensation, which worried her, of rising sap. She knew\nthe feeling, because she had sometimes had it in childhood in specially\nswift springs, when the lilacs and the syringas seemed to rush out into\nblossom in a single night, but it was strange to have it again after\nover fifty years. She would have liked to remark on the sensation to\nsome one, but she was ashamed. It was such an absurd sensation at her\nage. Yet oftener and oftener, and every day more and more, did Mrs.\nFisher have a ridiculous feeling as if she were presently going to\nburgeon."

  "content": "Sternly she tried to frown the unseemly sensation down. Burgeon,\nindeed. She had heard of dried staffs, pieces of mere dead wood,\nsuddenly putting forth fresh leaves, but only in legend. She was not in\nlegend. She knew perfectly what was due to herself. Dignity demanded\nthat she should have nothing to do with fresh leaves at her age; and\nyet there it was—the feeling that presently, that at any moment now,\nshe might crop out all green.Mrs. Fisher was upset. There were many things she disliked more than\nanything else, and one was when the elderly imagined they felt young\nand behaved accordingly. Of course they only imagined it, they were\nonly deceiving themselves; but how deplorable were the results. She\nherself had grown old as people should grow old—steadily and firmly. No\ninterruptions, no belated after-glows and spasmodic returns. If, after\nall these years, she were now going to be deluded into some sort of\nunsuitable breaking-out, how humiliating.Indeed she was thankful, that second week, that Kate Lumley was not\nthere. It would be most unpleasant, should anything different occur in\nher behaviour, to have Kate looking on. Kate had known her all her\nlife. She felt she could let herself go—here Mrs. Fisher frowned at the\nbook she was vainly trying to concentrate on, for where did that\nexpression come from?—much less painfully before strangers than before\nan old friend. Old friends, reflected Mrs. Fisher, who hoped she was\nreading, compare one constantly with what one used to be. They are\nalways doing it if one develops. They are surprised at development.\nThey hark back; they expect motionlessness after, say, fifty, to the\nend of one’s days.That, thought Mrs. Fisher, her eyes going steadily line by line down\nthe page and not a word of it getting through into her consciousness,\nis foolish of friends. It is condemning one to a premature death. One\nshould continue (of course with dignity) to develop, however old one\nmay be. She had nothing against developing, against further ripeness,\nbecause as long as one was alive one was not dead—obviously, decided\nMrs. Fisher, and development, change, ripening, were life. What she\nwould dislike would be unripening, going back to something green. She\nwould dislike it intensely; and this is what she felt she was on the\nbrink of doing."

  "content": "Naturally it made her very uneasy, and only in constant movement could\nshe find distraction. Increasingly restless and no longer able to\nconfine herself to her battlements, she wandered more and more\nfrequently, and also aimlessly, in and out of the top garden, to the\ngrowing surprise of Scrap, especially when she found that all Mrs.\nFisher did was to stare for a few minutes at the view, pick a few dead\nleaves off the rose-bushes, and go away again.In Mr. Wilkins’s conversation she found temporary relief, but though he\njoined her whenever he could he was not always there, for he spread his\nattentions judiciously among the three ladies, and when he was\nsomewhere else she had to face and manage her thoughts as best she\ncould by herself. Perhaps it was the excess of light and colour at San\nSalvatore which made every other place seem dark and black; and Prince\nof Wales Terrace did seem a very dark black spot to have to go back\nto—a dark, narrow street, and her house dark and narrow as the street,\nwith nothing really living or young in it. The goldfish could hardly be\ncalled living, or at most not more than half living, and were certainly\nnot young, and except for them there were only the maids, and they were\ndusty old things.Dusty old things. Mrs. Fisher paused in her thoughts, arrested by the\nstrange expression. Where had it come from? How was it possible for it\nto come at all? It might have been one of Mrs. Wilkins’s, in its\nlevity, its almost slang. Perhaps it was one of hers, and she had heard\nher say it and unconsciously caught it from her."

  "content": "If so, this was both serious and disgusting. That the foolish creature\nshould penetrate into Mrs. Fisher’s very mind and establish her\npersonality there, the personality which was still, in spite of the\nharmony apparently existing between her and her intelligent husband, so\nalien to Mrs. Fisher’s own, so far removed from what she understood and\nliked, and infect her with her undesirable phrases, was most\ndisturbing. Never in her life before had such a sentence come into Mrs.\nFisher’s head. Never in her life before had she thought of her maids,\nor of anybody else, as dusty old things. Her maids were not dusty old\nthings; they were most respectable, neat women, who were allowed the\nuse of the bathroom every Saturday night. Elderly, certainly, but then\nso was she, so was her house, so was her furniture, so were her\ngoldfish. They were all elderly, as they should be, together. But there\nwas a great difference between being elderly and being a dusty old\nthing.How true it was what Ruskin said, that evil communications corrupt good\nmanners. But did Ruskin say it? On second thoughts she was not sure,\nbut it was just the sort of thing he would have said if he had said it,\nand in any case it was true. Merely hearing Mrs. Wilkins’s evil\ncommunications at meals—she did not listen, she avoided listening, yet\nit was evident she had heard—those communications which, in that they\nso often were at once vulgar, indelicate and profane, and always, she\nwas sorry to say, laughed at by Lady Caroline, must be classed as evil,\nwas spoiling her own mental manners. Soon she might not only think but\nsay. How terrible that would be. If that were the form her breaking-out\nwas going to take, the form of unseemly speech, Mrs. Fisher was afraid\nshe would hardly with any degree of composure be able to bear it.At this stage Mrs. Fisher wished more than ever that she were able to\ntalk over her strange feelings with some one who would understand.\nThere was, however, no one who would understand except Mrs. Wilkins\nherself. She would. She would know at once, Mrs. Fisher was sure, what\nshe felt like. But this was impossible. It would be as abject as\nbegging the very microbe that was infecting one for protection against\nits disease.She continued, accordingly, to bear her sensations in silence, and was\ndriven by them into that frequent aimless appearing in the top garden\nwhich presently roused even Scrap’s attention.Scrap had noticed it, and vaguely wondered at it, for some time before\nMr. Wilkins inquired of her one morning as he arranged her cushions for\nher—he had established the daily assisting of Lady Caroline into her\nchair as his special privilege—whether there was anything the matter\nwith Mrs. Fisher.At that moment Mrs. Fisher was standing by the eastern parapet, shading\nher eyes and carefully scrutinising the distant white houses of\nMezzago. They could see her through the branches of the daphnes.“I don’t know,” said Scrap."

I\nam. And a lawyer on the spot,” said Mr. Wilkins, who endeavoured to\nmake his conversation when he talked to Lady Caroline light, aware that\none must be light with young ladies, “is worth two in—we won’t be\nordinary and complete the proverb, but say London.”“You should ask her.”“Ask her if she needs assistance? Would you advise it? Would it not be\na little—a little delicate to touch on such a question, the question\nwhether or no a lady has something on her mind?”“Perhaps she will tell you if you go and talk to her. I think it must\nbe lonely to be Mrs. Fisher.”“You are all thoughtfulness and consideration,” declared Mr. Wilkins,\nwishing, for the first time in his life, that he were a foreigner so\nthat he might respectfully kiss her hand on withdrawing to go\nobediently and relieve Mrs. Fisher’s loneliness."

  "content": "It was wonderful what a variety of exits from her corner Scrap\ncontrived for Mr. Wilkins. Each morning she found a different one,\nwhich sent him off pleased after he had arranged her cushions for her.\nShe allowed him to arrange the cushions because she instantly had\ndiscovered, the very first five minutes of the very first evening, that\nher fears lest he should cling to her and stare in dreadful admiration\nwere baseless. Mr. Wilkins did not admire like that. It was not only,\nshe instinctively felt, not in him, but if it had been he would not\nhave dared to in her case. He was all respectfulness. She could direct\nhis movements in regard to herself with the raising of an eyelash. His\none concern was to obey. She had been prepared to like him if he would\nonly be so obliging as not to admire her, and she did like him. She did\nnot forget his moving defencelessness the first morning in his towel,\nand he amused her, and he was kind to Lotty. It is true she liked him\nmost when he wasn’t there, but then she usually liked everybody most\nwhen they weren’t there. Certainly he did seem to be one of those men,\nrare in her experience, who never looked at a woman from the predatory\nangle. The comfort of this, the simplification it brought into the\nrelations of the party, was immense. From this point of view Mr.\nWilkins was simply ideal; he was unique and precious. Whenever she\nthought of him, and was perhaps inclined to dwell on the aspects of him\nthat were a little boring, she remembered this and murmured, “But what\na treasure.”Indeed it was Mr. Wilkins’s one aim during his stay at San Salvatore to\nbe a treasure. At all costs the three ladies who were not his wife must\nlike him and trust him. Then presently when trouble arose in their\nlives—and in what lives did not trouble sooner or later arise?—they\nwould recollect how reliable he was and how sympathetic, and turn to\nhim for advice. Ladies with something on their minds were exactly what\nhe wanted. Lady Caroline, he judged, had nothing on hers at the moment,\nbut so much beauty—for he could not but see what was evident—must have\nhad its difficulties in the past and would have more of them before it\nhad done. In the past he had not been at hand; in the future he hoped\nto be. And meanwhile the behaviour of Mrs. Fisher, the next in\nimportance of the ladies from the professional point of view, showed\ndefinite promise. It was almost certain that Mrs. Fisher had something\non her mind. He had been observing her attentively, and it was almost\ncertain.With the third, with Mrs. Arbuthnot, he had up to this made least\nheadway, for she was so very retiring and quiet. But might not this\nvery retiringness, this tendency to avoid the others and spend her time\nalone, indicate that she too was troubled? If so, he was her man. He\nwould cultivate her. He would follow her and sit with her, and\nencourage her to tell him about herself. Arbuthnot, he understood from\nLotty, was a British Museum official—nothing specially important at\npresent, but Mr. Wilkins regarded it as his business to know all sorts\nand kinds. Besides, there was promotion. Arbuthnot, promoted, might\nbecome very much worth while."

  "content": "As for Lotty, she was charming. She really had all the qualities he had\ncredited her with during his courtship, and they had been, it appeared,\nmerely in abeyance since. His early impressions of her were now being\nendorsed by the affection and even admiration Lady Caroline showed for\nher. Lady Caroline Dester was the last person, he was sure, to be\nmistaken on such a subject. Her knowledge of the world, her constant\nassociation with only the best, must make her quite unerring. Lotty was\nevidently, then, that which before marriage he had believed her to\nbe—she was valuable. She certainly had been most valuable in\nintroducing him to Lady Caroline and Mrs. Fisher. A man in his\nprofession could be immensely helped by a clever and attractive wife.\nWhy had she not been attractive sooner? Why this sudden flowering?Mr. Wilkins began too to believe there was something peculiar, as Lotty\nhad almost at once informed him, in the atmosphere of San Salvatore. It\npromoted expansion. It brought out dormant qualities. And feeling more\nand more pleased, and even charmed, by his wife, and very content with\nthe progress he was making with the two others, and hopeful of progress\nto be made with the retiring third, Mr. Wilkins could not remember ever\nhaving had such an agreeable holiday. The only thing that might perhaps\nbe bettered was the way they would call him Mr. Wilkins. Nobody said\nMr. Mellersh-Wilkins. Yet he had introduced himself to Lady Caroline—he\nflinched a little on remembering the circumstances—as Mellersh-Wilkins.Still, this was a small matter, not enough to worry about. He would be\nfoolish if in such a place and such society he worried about anything.\nHe was not even worrying about what the holiday was costing, and had\nmade up his mind to pay not only his own expenses but his wife’s as\nwell, and surprise her at the end by presenting her with her nest-egg\nas intact as when she started; and just the knowledge that he was\npreparing a happy surprise for her made him feel warmer than ever\ntowards her.In fact Mr. Wilkins, who had begun by being consciously and according\nto plan on his best behaviour, remained on it unconsciously, and with\nno effort at all."

In the garden that\nsecond week the poet’s eyed narcissus disappeared out the long grass at\nthe edge of the zigzag path, and wild gladiolus, slender and\nrose-coloured, came in their stead, white pinks bloomed in the borders,\nfilling the whole place with their smoky-sweet smell, and a bush nobody\nhad noticed burst into glory and fragrance, and it was a purple lilac\nbush. Such a jumble of spring and summer was not to be believed in,\nexcept by those who dwelt in those gardens. Everything seemed to be out\ntogether—all the things crowded into one month which in England are\nspread penuriously over six. Even primroses were found one day by Mrs.\nWilkins in a cold corner up in the hills; and when she brought them\ndown to the geraniums and heliotrope of San Salvatore they looked quite\nshy.Chapter 17On the first day of the third week Rose wrote to Frederick.In case she should again hesitate and not post the letter, she gave it\nto Domenico to post; for if she did not write now there would be no\ntime left at all. Half the month at San Salvatore was over. Even if\nFrederick started directly he got the letter, which of course he\nwouldn’t be able to do, what with packing and passport, besides not\nbeing in a hurry to come, he couldn’t arrive for five days.Having done it, Rose wished she hadn’t. He wouldn’t come. He wouldn’t\nbother to answer. And if he did answer, it would just be giving some\nreason which was not true, and about being too busy to get away; and\nall that had been got by writing to him would be that she would be more\nunhappy than before."

She wished she had never come away on a\nholiday. What did she want with holidays? Work was her salvation; work\nwas the only thing that protected one, that kept one steady and one’s\nvalues true. At home in Hampstead, absorbed and busy, she had managed\nto get over Frederick, thinking of him latterly only with the gentle\nmelancholy with which one thinks of some one once loved but long since\ndead; and now this place, idleness in this soft place, had thrown her\nback to the wretched state she had climbed so carefully out of years\nago. Why, if Frederick did come she would only bore him. Hadn’t she\nseen in a flash quite soon after getting to San Salvatore that that was\nreally what kept him away from her? And why should she suppose that\nnow, after such a long estrangement, she would be able not to bore him,\nbe able to do anything but stand before him like a tongue-tied idiot,\nwith all the fingers of her spirit turned into thumbs? Besides, what a\nhopeless position, to have as it were to beseech: Please wait a\nlittle—please don’t be impatient—I think perhaps I shan’t be a bore\npresently.A thousand times a day Rose wished she had let Frederick alone. Lotty,\nwho asked her every evening whether she had sent her letter yet,\nexclaimed with delight when the answer at last was yes, and threw her\narms round her. “Now we shall be _completely_ happy!” cried the\nenthusiastic Lotty.But nothing seemed less certain to Rose, and her expression became more\nand more the expression of one who has something on her mind.Mr. Wilkins, wanting to find out what it was, strolled in the sun in\nhis Panama hat, and began to meet her accidentally.“I did not know,” said Mr. Wilkins the first time, courteously raising\nhis hat, “that you too liked this particular spot.” And he sat down\nbeside her.In the afternoon she chose another spot; and she had not been in it\nhalf an hour before Mr. Wilkins, lightly swinging his cane, came round\nthe corner.“We are destined to meet in our rambles,” said Mr. Wilkins pleasantly.\nAnd he sat down beside her.Mr. Wilkins was very kind, and she had, she saw, misjudged him in\nHampstead, and this was the real man, ripened like fruit by the\nbeneficent sun of San Salvatore, but Rose did want to be alone. Still,\nshe was grateful to him for proving to her that though she might bore\nFrederick she did not bore everybody; if she had, he would not have sat\ntalking to her on each occasion till it was time to go in. True he\nbored her, but that wasn’t anything like so dreadful as if she bored\nhim. Then indeed her vanity would have been sadly ruffled. For now that\nRose was not able to say her prayers she was being assailed by every\nsort of weakness: vanity, sensitiveness, irritability,\npugnacity—strange, unfamiliar devils to have coming crowding on one and\ntaking possession of one’s swept and empty heart. She had never been\nvain or irritable or pugnacious in her life before. Could it be that\nSan Salvatore was capable of opposite effects, and the same sun that\nripened Mr. Wilkins made her go acid?"

She was certainly secretive, for though he had been\nskilful and sympathetic for a whole week, she had as yet given him no\ninkling of what was so evidently worrying her.“Poor old thing,” said Lotty, on his asking her if she perhaps could\nthrow light on Mrs. Fisher’s troubles. “She hasn’t got love.”“Love?” Mr. Wilkins could only echo, genuinely scandalised. “But\nsurely, my dear—at her age—”“_Any_ love,” said Lotty.That very morning he had asked his wife, for he now sought and\nrespected her opinion, if she could tell him what was the matter with\nMrs. Arbuthnot, for she too, though he had done his best to thaw her\ninto confidences, had remained persistently retiring.“She wants her husband,” said Lotty.“Ah,” said Mr. Wilkins, a new light shed on Mrs. Arbuthnot’s shy and\nmodest melancholy. And he added, “Very proper.”And Lotty said, smiling at him, “One does.”And Mr. Wilkins said, smiling at her, “Does one?”And Lotty said, smiling at him, “Of course.”And Mr. Wilkins, much pleased with her, though it was still quite early\nin the day, a time when caresses are sluggish, pinched her ear."

Pink, white, red, striped—she fingered and smelt them one\nafter the other, so as not to get to her disappointment too quickly. As\nlong as she hadn’t seen for herself, seen the table in the hall quite\nempty except for its bowl of flowers, she still could hope, she still\ncould have the joy of imagining the telegram lying on it waiting for\nher. But there is no smell in a camellia, as Mr. Wilkins, who was\nstanding in the doorway on the look-out for her and knew what was\nnecessary in horticulture, reminded her.She started at his voice and looked up.“A telegram has come for you,” said Mr. Wilkins.She stared at him, her mouth open.“I searched for you everywhere, but failed—”Of course. She knew it. She had been sure of it all the time. Bright\nand burning, Youth in that instant flashed down again on Rose. She flew\nup the steps, red as the camellia she had just been fingering, and was\nin the hall and tearing open the telegram before Mr. Wilkins had\nfinished his sentence. Why, but if things could happen like this—why,\nbut there was no end to—why, she and Frederick—they were going to\nbe—again—at last—“No bad news, I trust?” said Mr. Wilkins who had followed her, for when\nshe had read the telegram she stood staring at it and her face went\nslowly white. Curious to watch how her face went slowly white.She turned and looked at Mr. Wilkins as if trying to remember him.“Oh no. On the contrary—”She managed to smile. “I’m going to have a visitor,” she said, holding\nout the telegram; and when he had taken it she walked away towards the\ndining-room, murmuring something about lunch being ready.Mr. Wilkins read the telegram. It had been sent that morning from\nMezzago, and was:Am passing through on way to Rome. May I pay my respects this\nafternoon?Thomas Briggs.Why should such a telegram make the interesting lady turn pale? For her\npallor on reading it had been so striking as to convince Mr. Wilkins\nshe was receiving a blow.“Who is Thomas Briggs?” he asked, following her into the dining-room.She looked at him vaguely. “Who is—?” she repeated, getting her\nthoughts together again.“Thomas Briggs.”“Oh. Yes. He is the owner. This is his house. He is very nice. He is\ncoming this afternoon.”"

  "content": "Thomas Briggs was at that very moment coming. He was jogging along the\nroad between Mezzago and Castagneto in a fly, sincerely hoping that the\ndark-eyed lady would grasp that all he wanted was to see her, and not\nat all to see if his house were still there. He felt that an owner of\ndelicacy did not intrude on a tenant. But—he had been thinking so much\nof her since that day. Rose Arbuthnot. Such a pretty name. And such a\npretty creature—mild, milky, mothery in the best sense; the best sense\nbeing that she wasn’t his mother and couldn’t have been if she had\ntried, for parents were the only things impossible to have younger than\noneself. Also, he was passing so near. It seemed absurd not just to\nlook in and see if she were comfortable. He longed to see her in his\nhouse. He longed to see it as her background, to see her sitting in his\nchairs, drinking out of his cups, using all his things. Did she put the\nbig crimson brocade cushion in the drawing-room behind her little dark\nhead? Her hair and the whiteness of her skin would look lovely against\nit. Had she seen the portrait of herself on the stairs? He wondered if\nshe liked it. He would explain it to her. If she didn’t paint, and she\nhad said nothing to suggest it, she wouldn’t perhaps notice how exactly\nthe moulding of the eyebrows and the slight hollow of the cheek—He told the fly to wait in Castagneto, and crossed the piazza, hailed\nby children and dogs, who all knew him and sprang up suddenly from\nnowhere, and walking quickly up the zigzag path, for he was an active\nyoung man not much more than thirty, he pulled the ancient chain that\nrang the bell, and waited decorously on the proper side of the open\ndoor to be allowed to come in.At the sight of him Francesca flung up every bit of her that would\nfling up—eyebrows, eyelids, and hands, and volubly assured him that all\nwas in perfect order and that she was doing her duty.“Of course, of course,” said Briggs, cutting her short. “No one doubts\nit.”And he asked her to take in his card to her mistress.“Which mistress?” asked Francesca.“Which mistress?”“There are four,” said Francesca, scenting an irregularity on the part\nof the tenants, for her master looked surprised; and she felt pleased,\nfor life was dull and irregularities helped it along at least a little.“Four?” he repeated surprised. “Well, take it to the lot then,” he\nsaid, recovering himself, for he noticed her expression.Coffee was being drunk in the top garden in the shade of the umbrella\npine. Only Mrs. Fisher and Mr. Wilkins were drinking it, for Mrs.\nArbuthnot, after eating nothing and being completely silent during\nlunch, had disappeared immediately afterwards.While Francesca went away into the garden with his card, her master\nstood examining the picture on the staircase of that Madonna by an\nearly Italian painter, name unknown, picked up by him at Orvieto, who\nwas so much like his tenant. It really was remarkable, the likeness. Of\ncourse his tenant that day in London had had her hat on, but he was\npretty sure her hair grew just like that off her forehead. The\nexpression of the eyes, grave and sweet, was exactly the same. He\nrejoiced to think that he would always have her portrait."

She had supposed he would come\nabout tea-time, and till then she had meant to sit somewhere out of\ndoors where she could be by herself.He watched her coming down the stairs with the utmost eager interest.\nIn a moment she would be level with her portrait.“It really is extraordinary,” said Briggs.“How do you do,” said Rose, intent only on a decent show of welcome.She did not welcome him. He was here, she felt, the telegram bitter in\nher heart, instead of Frederick, doing what she had longed Frederick\nwould do, taking his place.“Just stand still a moment—”She obeyed automatically.“Yes—quite astonishing. Do you mind taking off your hat?”Rose, surprised, took it off obediently.“Yes—I thought so—I just wanted to make sure. And look—have you\nnoticed—”He began to make odd swift passes with his hand over the face in the\npicture, measuring it, looking from it to her.Rose’s surprise became amusement, and she could not help smiling. “Have\nyou come to compare me with my original?” she asked.“You do see how extraordinarily alike—”“I didn’t know I looked so solemn.”“You don’t. Not now. You did a minute ago, quite as solemn. Oh yes—how\ndo you do,” he finished suddenly, noticing her outstretched hand. And\nhe laughed and shook it, flushing—a trick of his—to the roots of his\nfair hair.Francesca came back. “The Signora Fisher,” she said, “will be pleased\nto see him.”“Who is the Signora Fisher?” he asked Rose.“One of the four who are sharing your house.”“Then there are four of you?”“Yes. My friend and I found we couldn’t afford it by ourselves.”“Oh, I say—” began Briggs in confusion, for he would best have liked\nRose Arbuthnot—pretty name—not to have to afford anything, but to stay\nat San Salvatore as long as she liked as his guest.“Mrs. Fisher is having coffee in the top garden,” said Rose. “I’ll take\nyou to her and introduce you.”"

I’d immensely like being shown round by you.”“But Mrs. Fisher is waiting for you.”“Won’t she keep?”“Yes,” said Rose, with the smile that had so much attracted him the\nfirst day. “I think she will keep quite well till tea.”“Do you speak Italian?”“No,” said Rose. “Why?”On that he turned to Francesca, and told her at a great rate, for in\nItalian he was glib, to go back to the Signora in the top garden and\ntell her he had encountered his old friend the Signora Arbuthnot, and\nwas going for a walk with her and would present himself to her later.“Do you invite me to tea?” he asked Rose, when Francesca had gone.“Of course. It’s your house.”“It isn’t. It’s yours.”“Till Monday week,” she smiled.“Come and show me all the views,” he said eagerly; and it was plain,\neven to the self-depreciatory Rose, that she did not bore Mr. Briggs.Chapter 18They had a very pleasant walk, with a great deal of sitting down in\nwarm, thyme-fragrant corners, and if anything could have helped Rose to\nrecover from the bitter disappointment of the morning it would have\nbeen the company and conversation of Mr. Briggs. He did help her to\nrecover, and the same process took place as that which Lotty had\nundergone with her husband, and the more Mr. Briggs thought Rose\ncharming the more charming she became.Briggs was a man incapable of concealments, who never lost time if he\ncould help it. They had not got to the end of the headland where the\nlighthouse is—Briggs asked her to show him the lighthouse, because the\npath to it, he knew, was wide enough for two to walk abreast and fairly\nlevel—before he had told her of the impression she had made on him in\nLondon."

  "content": "Since even the most religious, sober women like to know they have made\nan impression, particularly the kind that has nothing to do with\ncharacter or merits, Rose was pleased. Being pleased, she smiled.\nSmiling, she was more attractive than ever. Colour came into her\ncheeks, and brightness into her eyes. She heard herself saying things\nthat really sounded quite interesting and even amusing. If Frederick\nwere listening now, she thought, perhaps he would see that she couldn’t\nafter all be such a hopeless bore; for here was a man, nice-looking,\nyoung, and surely clever—he seemed clever, and she hoped he was, for\nthen the compliment would be still greater—who was evidently quite\nhappy to spend the afternoon just talking to her.And indeed Mr. Briggs seemed very much interested. He wanted to hear\nall about everything she had been doing from the moment she got there.\nHe asked her if she had seen this, that, and the other in the house,\nwhat she liked best, which room she had, if she were comfortable, if\nFrancesca was behaving, if Domenico took care of her, and whether she\ndidn’t enjoy using the yellow sitting-room—the one that got all the sun\nand looked out towards Genoa.Rose was ashamed how little she had noticed in the house, and how few\nof the things he spoke of as curious or beautiful in it she had even\nseen. Swamped in thoughts of Frederick, she appeared to have lived in\nSan Salvatore blindly, and more than half the time had gone, and what\nhad been the good of it? She might just as well have been sitting\nhankering on Hampstead Heath. No, she mightn’t; through all her\nhankerings she had been conscious that she was at least in the very\nheart of beauty; and indeed it was this beauty, this longing to share\nit, that had first started her off hankering.Mr. Briggs, however, was too much alive for her to be able to spare any\nattention at this moment for Frederick, and she praised the servants in\nanswer to his questions, and praised the yellow sitting-room without\ntelling him she had only been in it once and then was ignominiously\nejected, and she told him she knew hardly anything about art and\ncuriosities, but thought perhaps if somebody would tell her about them\nshe would know more, and she said she had spent every day since her\narrival out-of-doors, because out-of-doors there was so very wonderful\nand different from anything she had ever seen."

  "content": "Briggs walked by her side along his paths that were yet so happily for\nthe moment her paths, and felt all the innocent glows of family life.\nHe was an orphan and an only child, and had a warm, domestic\ndisposition. He would have adored a sister and spoilt a mother, and was\nbeginning at this time to think of marrying; for though he had been\nvery happy with his various loves, each of whom, contrary to the usual\nexperience, turned ultimately into his devoted friend, he was fond of\nchildren and thought he had perhaps now got to the age of settling if\nhe did not wish to be too old by the time his eldest son was twenty.\nSan Salvatore had latterly seemed a little forlorn. He fancied it\nechoed when he walked about it. He had felt lonely there; so lonely\nthat he had preferred this year to miss out a spring and let it. It\nwanted a wife in it. It wanted that final touch of warmth and beauty,\nfor he never thought of his wife except in terms of warmth and\nbeauty—she would of course be beautiful and kind. It amused him how\nmuch in love with this vague wife he was already.At such a rate was he making friends with the lady with the sweet name\nas he walked along the path towards the lighthouse, that he was sure\npresently he would be telling her everything about himself and his past\ndoings and his future hopes; and the thought of such a swiftly\ndeveloping confidence made him laugh.“Why are you laughing?” she asked, looking at him and smiling.“It’s so like coming home,” he said.“But it is coming home for you to come here.”“I mean _really_ like coming home. To one’s—one’s family. I never had a\nfamily. I’m an orphan.”“Oh, are you?” said Rose with the proper sympathy. “I hope you’ve not\nbeen one very long. No—I mean I hope you have been one very long. No—I\ndon’t know what I mean, except that I’m sorry.”He laughed again. “Oh I’m used to it. I haven’t anybody. No sisters or\nbrothers.”“Then you’re an only child,” she observed intelligently.“Yes. And there’s something about you that’s exactly my idea of a—of a\nfamily.”She was amused.“So—cosy,” he said, looking at her and searching for a word.“You wouldn’t think so if you saw my house in Hampstead,” she said, a\nvision of that austere and hard-seated dwelling presenting itself to\nher mind, with nothing soft in it except the shunned and neglected Du\nBarri sofa. No wonder, she thought, for a moment clear-brained, that\nFrederick avoided it. There was nothing cosy about _his_ family.“I don’t believe any place you lived in could be anything but exactly\nlike you,” he said.“You’re not going to pretend San Salvatore is like me?”“Indeed I do pretend it. Surely you admit that it is beautiful?”He said several things like that. She enjoyed her walk. She could not\nrecollect any walk so pleasant since her courting days."

Trouble here,\ntrouble here, thought Mr. Wilkins, mentally rubbing his professional\nhands. He could see himself being called in presently to advise. On the\none hand there was Arbuthnot, on the other hand here was Briggs.\nTrouble brewing, trouble sooner or later. But why had Briggs’s telegram\nacted on the lady like a blow? If she had turned pale from excess of\njoy, then trouble was nearer than he had supposed. She was not pale\nnow; she was more like her name than he had yet seen her. Well, he was\nthe man for trouble. He regretted, of course, that people should get\ninto it, but being in he was their man.And Mr. Wilkins, invigorated by these thoughts, his career being very\nprecious to him, proceeded to assist in doing the honours to Mr.\nBriggs, both in his quality of sharer in the temporary ownership of San\nSalvatore and of probable helper out of difficulties, with great\nhospitality, and pointed out the various features of the place to him,\nand led him to the parapet and showed him Mezzago across the bay.Mrs. Fisher too was gracious. This was this young man’s house. He was a\nman of property. She liked property, and she liked men of property.\nAlso there seemed a peculiar merit in being a man of property so young.\nInheritance, of course; and inheritance was more respectable than\nacquisition. It did indicate fathers; and in an age where most people\nappeared neither to have them nor to want them she liked this too.Accordingly it was a pleasant meal, with everybody amiable and pleased.\nBriggs thought Mrs. Fisher a dear old lady, and showed he thought so;\nand again the magic worked, and she became a dear old lady. She\ndeveloped benignity with him, and a kind of benignity which was almost\nplayful—actually before tea was over including in some observation she\nmade him the words “My dear boy.”"
