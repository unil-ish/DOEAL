  "content": "It was very curious, and no one in the world could have been more\nsurprised than she herself, but she wanted to think. She had never\nwanted to do that before. Everything else that it is possible to do\nwithout too much inconvenience she had either wanted to do or had done\nat one period or another of her life, but not before had she wanted to\nthink. She had come to San Salvatore with the single intention of lying\ncomatose for four weeks in the sun, somewhere where her parents and\nfriends were not, lapped in forgetfulness, stirring herself only to be\nfed, and she had not been there more than a few hours when this strange\nnew desire took hold of her.There had been wonderful stars the evening before, and she had gone out\ninto the top garden after dinner, leaving Mrs. Fisher alone over her\nnuts and wine, and, sitting on the wall at the place where the lilies\ncrowded their ghost heads, she had looked out into the gulf of the\nnight, and it had suddenly seemed as if her life had been a noise all\nabout nothing.She had been intensely surprised. She knew stars and darkness did\nproduce unusual emotions because, in others, she had seen them being\nproduced, but they had not before done it in herself. A noise all about\nnothing. Could she be quite well? She had wondered. For a long while\npast she had been aware that her life was a noise, but it had seemed to\nbe very much about something; a noise, indeed, about so much that she\nfelt she must get out of earshot for a little or she would be\ncompletely, and perhaps permanently, deafened. But suppose it was only\na noise about nothing?She had not had a question like that in her mind before. It had made\nher feel lonely. She wanted to be alone, but not lonely. That was very\ndifferent; that was something that ached and hurt dreadfully right\ninside one. It was what one dreaded most. It was what made one go to so\nmany parties; and lately even the parties had seemed once or twice not\nto be a perfectly certain protection. Was it possible that loneliness\nhad nothing to do with circumstances, but only with the way one met\nthem? Perhaps, she had thought, she had better go to bed. She couldn’t\nbe very well."

  "content": "She went to bed; and in the morning, after she had escaped the fly and\nhad her breakfast and got out again into the garden, there was this\nsame feeling again, and in broad daylight. Once more she had that\nreally rather disgusting suspicion that her life till now had not only\nbeen loud but empty. Well, if that were so, and if her first\ntwenty-eight years—the best ones—had gone just in meaningless noise,\nshe had better stop a moment and look round her; pause, as they said in\ntiresome novels, and consider. She hadn’t got many sets of twenty-eight\nyears. One more would see her growing very like Mrs. Fisher. Two more—\nShe averted her eyes.Her mother would have been concerned if she had known. Her mother\ndoted. Her father would have been concerned too, for he also doted.\nEverybody doted. And when, melodiously obstinate, she had insisted on\ngoing off to entomb herself in Italy for a whole month with queer\npeople she had got out of an advertisement, refusing even to take her\nmaid, the only explanation her friends could imagine was that poor\nScrap—such was her name among them—had overdone it and was feeling a\nlittle nervy.Her mother had been distressed at her departure. It was such an odd\nthing to do, such a sign of disappointment. She encouraged the general\nidea of the verge of a nervous breakdown. If she could have seen her\nadored Scrap, more delightful to look upon than any other mother’s\ndaughter had ever yet been, the object of her utmost pride, the source\nof all her fondest hopes, sitting staring at the empty noonday\nMediterranean considering her three possible sets of twenty-eight\nyears, she would have been miserable. To go away alone was bad; to\nthink was worse. No good could come out of the thinking of a beautiful\nyoung woman. Complications could come out of it in profusion, but no\ngood. The thinking of the beautiful was bound to result in hesitations,\nin reluctances, in unhappiness all round. And here, if she could have\nseen her, sat her Scrap thinking quite hard. And such things. Such old\nthings. Things nobody ever began to think till they were at least\nforty.Chapter 9"

  "content": "That one of the two sitting-rooms which Mrs. Fisher had taken for her\nown was a room of charm and character. She surveyed it with\nsatisfaction on going into it after breakfast, and was glad it was\nhers. It had a tiled floor, and walls the colour of pale honey, and\ninlaid furniture the colour of amber, and mellow books, many in ivory\nor lemon-coloured covers. There was a big window overlooking the sea\ntowards Genoa, and a glass door through which she could proceed out on\nto the battlements and walk along past the quaint and attractive\nwatch-tower, in itself a room with chairs and a writing table, to where\non the other side of the tower the battlements ended in a marble seat,\nand one could see the western bay and the point round which began the\nGulf of Spezia. Her south view, between these two stretches of sea, was\nanother hill, higher than San Salvatore, the last of the little\npeninsula, with the bland turrets of a smaller and uninhabited castle\non the top, on which the setting sun still shone when everything else\nwas sunk in shadow. Yes, she was very comfortably established here; and\nreceptacles—Mrs. Fisher did not examine their nature closely, but they\nseemed to be small stone troughs, or perhaps little sarcophagi—ringed\nround the battlements with flowers.These battlements, she thought, considering them, would have been a\nperfect place for her to pace up and down gently in moments when she\nleast felt the need of her stick, or to sit in on the marble seat,\nhaving first put a cushion on it, if there had not unfortunately been a\nsecond glass door opening on to them, destroying their complete\nprivacy, spoiling her feeling that the place was only for her. The\nsecond door belonged to the round drawing-room, which both she and Lady\nCaroline had rejected as too dark. That room would probably be sat in\nby the women from Hampstead, and she was afraid they would not confine\nthemselves to sitting in it, but would come out through the glass door\nand invade her battlements. This would ruin the battlements. It would\nruin them as far as she was concerned if they were to be overrun; or\neven if, not actually overrun, they were liable to be raked by the eyes\nof persons inside the room. No one could be perfectly at ease if they\nwere being watched and knew it. What she wanted, what she surely had a\nright to, was privacy. She had no wish to intrude on the others; why\nthen should they intrude on her? And she could always relax her privacy\nif, when she became better acquainted with her companions, she should\nthink it worth while, but she doubted whether any of the three would so\ndevelop as to make her think it worth while."

  "content": "Hardly anything was really worth while, reflected Mrs. Fisher, except\nthe past. It was astonishing, it was simply amazing, the superiority of\nthe past to the present. Those friends of hers in London, solid persons\nof her own age, knew the same past that she knew, could talk about it\nwith her, could compare it as she did with the tinkling present, and in\nremembering great men forget for a moment the trivial and barren young\npeople who still, in spite of the war, seemed to litter the world in\nsuch numbers. She had not come away from these friends, these\nconversable ripe friends, in order to spend her time in Italy chatting\nwith three persons of another generation and defective experience; she\nhad come away merely to avoid the treacheries of a London April. It was\ntrue what she had told the two who came to Prince of Wales Terrace,\nthat all she wished to do at San Salvatore was to sit by herself in the\nsun and remember. They knew this, for she had told them. It had been\nplainly expressed and clearly understood. Therefore she had a right to\nexpect them to stay inside the round drawing-room and not to emerge\ninterruptingly on to her battlements.But would they? The doubt spoilt her morning. It was only towards\nlunch-time that she saw a way to be quite safe, and ringing for\nFrancesca, bade her, in slow and majestic Italian, shut the shutters of\nthe glass door of the round drawing-room, and then, going with her into\nthe room, which had become darker than ever in consequence, but also,\nMrs. Fisher observed to Francesca, who was being voluble, would because\nof this very darkness remain agreeably cool, and after all there were\nthe numerous slit-windows in the walls to let in light and it was\nnothing to do with her if they did not let it in, she directed the\nplacing of a cabinet of curios across the door on its inside.This would discourage egress.Then she rang for Domenico, and caused him to move one of the\nflower-filled sarcophagi across the door on its outside.This would discourage ingress.“No one,” said Domenico, hesitating, “will be able to use the door.”“No one,” said Mrs. Fisher firmly, “will wish to.”She then retired to her sitting-room, and from a chair placed where she\ncould look straight on to them, gazed at her battlements, secured to\nher now completely, with calm pleasure."

  "content": "Being here, she reflected placidly, was much cheaper than being in an\nhotel and, if she could keep off the others, immeasurably more\nagreeable. She was paying for her rooms—extremely pleasant rooms, now\nthat she was arranged in them—£3 a week, which came to about eight\nshillings a day, battlements, watch-tower and all. Where else abroad\ncould she live as well for so little, and have as many baths as she\nliked, for eight shillings a day? Of course she did not yet know what\nher food would cost, but she would insist on carefulness over that,\nthough she would also insist on its being carefulness combined with\nexcellence. The two were perfectly compatible if the caterer took\npains. The servants’ wages, she had ascertained, were negligible, owing\nto the advantageous exchange, so that there was only the food to cause\nher anxiety. If she saw signs of extravagance she would propose that\nthey each hand over a reasonable sum every week to Lady Caroline which\nshould cover the bills, any of it that was not used to be returned, and\nif it were exceeded the loss to be borne by the caterer.Mrs. Fisher was well off and had the desire for comforts proper to her\nage, but she disliked expenses. So well off was she that, had she so\nchosen, she could have lived in an opulent part of London and driven\nfrom it and to it in a Rolls-Royce. She had no such wish. It needed\nmore vitality than went with true comfort to deal with a house in an\nopulent spot and a Rolls-Royce. Worries attended such possessions,\nworries of every kind, crowned by bills. In the sober gloom of Prince\nof Wales Terrace she could obscurely enjoy inexpensive yet real\ncomfort, without being snatched at by predatory men-servants or\ncollectors for charities, and a taxi stand was at the end of the road.\nHer annual outlay was small. The house was inherited. Death had\nfurnished it for her. She trod in the dining-room on the Turkey carpet\nof her fathers; she regulated her day by the excellent black marble\nclock on the mantelpiece which she remembered from childhood; her walls\nwere entirely covered by the photographs her illustrious deceased\nfriends had given either herself or her father, with their own\nhandwriting across the lower parts of their bodies, and the windows,\nshrouded by the maroon curtains of all her life, were decorated besides\nwith the selfsame aquariums to which she owed her first lessons in\nsealore, and in which still swam slowly the goldfishes of her youth."

Perhaps, on the other hand, behind the deep-sea\nvegetation provided for them at the bottom, they had from time to time\nas the years went by withdrawn and replaced themselves. Were they or\nwere they not, she sometimes wondered, contemplating them between the\ncourses of her solitary meals, the same goldfish that had that day been\nthere when Carlyle—how well she remembered it—angrily strode up to them\nin the middle of some argument with her father that had grown heated,\nand striking the glass smartly with his fist had put them to flight,\nshouting as they fled, “Och, ye deaf deevils! Och, ye lucky deaf\ndeevils! Ye can’t hear anything of the blasted, blethering, doddering,\nglaikit fool-stuff yer maister talks, can ye?” Or words to that effect.Dear, great-souled Carlyle. Such natural gushings forth; such true\nfreshness; such real grandeur. Rugged, if you will—yes, undoubtedly\nsometimes rugged, and startling in a drawing-room, but magnificent. Who\nwas there now to put beside him? Who was there to mention in the same\nbreath? Her father, than whom no one had had more _flair_, said:\n“Thomas is immortal.” And here was this generation, this generation of\npuniness, raising its little voice in doubts, or, still worse, not\ngiving itself the trouble to raise it at all, not—it was incredible,\nbut it had been thus reported to her—even reading him. Mrs. Fisher did\nnot read him either, but that was different. She had read him; she had\ncertainly read him. Of course she had read him. There was\nTeufelsdröck—she quite well remembered a tailor called Teufelsdröck. So\nlike Carlyle to call him that. Yes, she must have read him, though\nnaturally details escaped her.The gong sounded. Lost in reminiscence Mrs. Fisher had forgotten time,\nand hastened to her bedroom to wash her hands and smoothe her hair. She\ndid not wish to be late and set a bad example, and perhaps find her\nseat at the head of the table taken. One could put no trust in the\nmanners of the younger generation; especially not in those of that Mrs.\nWilkins.She was, however, the first to arrive in the dining-room. Francesca in\na white apron stood ready with an enormous dish of smoking hot,\nglistening maccaroni, but nobody was there to eat it.Mrs. Fisher sat down, looking stern. Lax, lax.“Serve me,” she said to Francesca, who showed a disposition to wait for\nthe others."

  "content": "Francesca served her. Of the party she liked Mrs. Fisher least, in fact\nshe did not like her at all. She was the only one of the four ladies\nwho had not yet smiled. True she was old, true she was unbeautiful,\ntrue she therefore had no reason to smile, but kind ladies smiled,\nreason or no. They smiled, not because they were happy but because they\nwished to make happy. This one of the four ladies could not then,\nFrancesca decided, be kind; so she handed her the maccaroni, being\nunable to hide any of her feelings, morosely.It was very well cooked, but Mrs. Fisher had never cared for maccaroni,\nespecially not this long, worm-shaped variety. She found it difficult\nto eat—slippery, wriggling off her fork, making her look, she felt,\nundignified when, having got it as she supposed into her mouth, ends of\nit yet hung out. Always, too, when she ate it she was reminded of Mr.\nFisher. He had during their married life behaved very much like\nmaccaroni. He had slipped, he had wriggled, he had made her feel\nundignified, and when at last she had got him safe, as she thought,\nthere had invariably been little bits of him that still, as it were,\nhung out.Francesca from the sideboard watched Mrs. Fisher’s way with maccaroni\ngloomily, and her gloom deepened when she saw her at last take her\nknife to it and chop it small.Mrs. Fisher really did not know how else to get hold of the stuff. She\nwas aware that knives in this connection were improper, but one did\nfinally lose patience. Maccaroni was never allowed to appear on her\ntable in London. Apart from its tiresomeness she did not even like it,\nand she would tell Lady Caroline not to order it again. Years of\npractice, reflected Mrs. Fisher, chopping it up, years of actual living\nin Italy, would be necessary to learn the exact trick. Browning managed\nmaccaroni wonderfully. She remembered watching him one day when he came\nto lunch with her father, and a dish of it had been ordered as a\ncompliment to his connection with Italy. Fascinating, the way it went\nin. No chasing round the plate, no slidings off the fork, no subsequent\nprotrusions of loose ends—just one dig, one whisk, one thrust, one\ngulp, and lo, yet another poet had been nourished.“Shall I go and seek the young lady?” asked Francesca, unable any\nlonger to look on a good maccaroni being cut with a knife.Mrs. Fisher came out of her reminiscent reflections with difficulty.\n“She knows lunch is at half-past twelve,” she said. “They all know.”"

It was not an hotel, and\nconsiderations were due. She must say she was surprised at Mrs.\nArbuthnot, who had not looked like somebody unpunctual. Lady Caroline,\ntoo—she had seemed amiable and courteous, whatever else she might be.\nFrom the other one, of course, she expected nothing.Francesca fetched the gong, and took it out into the garden and\nadvanced, beating it as she advanced, close up to Lady Caroline, who,\nstill stretched in her low chair, waited till she had done, and then\nturned her head and in the sweetest tones poured forth what appeared to\nbe music but was really invective.Francesca did not recognise the liquid flow as invective; how was she\nto, when it came out sounding like that? And with her face all smiles,\nfor she could not but smile when she looked at this young lady, she\ntold her the maccaroni was getting cold.“When I do not come to meals it is because I do not wish to come to\nmeals,” said the irritated Scrap, “and you will not in future disturb\nme.”“Is she ill?” asked Francesca, sympathetic but unable to stop smiling.\nNever, never had she seen hair so beautiful. Like pure flax; like the\nhair of northern babes. On such a little head only blessing could rest,\non such a little head the nimbus of the holiest saints could fitly be\nplaced.Scrap shut her eyes and refused to answer. In this she was injudicious,\nfor its effect was to convince Francesca, who hurried away full of\nconcern to tell Mrs. Fisher, that she was indisposed. And Mrs. Fisher,\nbeing prevented, she explained, from going out to Lady Caroline herself\nbecause of her stick, sent the two others instead, who had come in at\nthat moment heated and breathless and full of excuses, while she\nherself proceeded to the next course, which was a very well-made\nomelette, bursting most agreeably at both its ends with young green\npeas."

Why should she go in to lunch\nif she didn’t want to? This wasn’t a private house; she was in no way\ntangled up in duties towards a tiresome hostess. For all practical\npurposes San Salvatore was an hotel, and she ought to be let alone to\neat or not to eat exactly as if she really had been in an hotel.But the unfortunate Scrap could not just sit still and close her eyes\nwithout rousing that desire to stroke and pet in her beholders with\nwhich she was only too familiar. Even the cook had patted her. And now\na gentle hand—how well she knew and how much she dreaded gentle\nhands—was placed on her forehead.“I’m afraid you’re not well,” said a voice that was not Mrs. Fisher’s,\nand therefore must belong to one of the originals.“I have a headache,” murmured Scrap. Perhaps it was best to say that;\nperhaps it was the shortest cut to peace.“I’m so sorry,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot softly, for it was her hand being\ngentle.“And I,” said Scrap to herself, “who thought if I came here I would\nescape mothers.”“Don’t you think some tea would do you good?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot\ntenderly.Tea? The idea was abhorrent to Scrap. In this heat to be drinking tea\nin the middle of the day. . .“No,” she murmured.“I expect what would really be best for her,” said another voice, “is\nto be left quiet.”How sensible, thought Scrap; and raised the eye-lashes of one eye just\nenough to peep through and see who was speaking.It was the freckled original. The dark one, then, was the one with the\nhand. The freckled one rose in her esteem.“But I can’t bear to think of you with a headache and nothing being\ndone for it,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Would a cup of strong black\ncoffee—?”"

Do you\nknow what aspirin is in Italian?”“The proper remedy for headaches,” said Mrs. Fisher firmly, “is castor\noil.”“But she hasn’t got a headache,” said Mrs. Wilkins.“Carlyle,” said Mrs. Fisher, who had finished her omelette and had\nleisure, while she waited for the next course, to talk, “suffered at\none period terribly from headaches, and he constantly took castor oil\nas a remedy. He took it, I should say, almost to excess, and called it,\nI remember, in his interesting way the oil of sorrow. My father said it\ncoloured for a time his whole attitude to life, his whole philosophy.\nBut that was because he took too much. What Lady Caroline wants is one\ndose, and one only. It is a mistake to keep on taking castor oil.”“Do you know the Italian for it?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Ah, that I’m afraid I don’t. However, she would know. You can ask\nher.”“But she hasn’t got a headache,” repeated Mrs. Wilkins, who was\nstruggling with the maccaroni. “She only wants to be let alone.”They both looked at her. The word shovel crossed Mrs. Fisher’s mind in\nconnection with Mrs. Wilkins’s actions at that moment.“Then why should she say she has?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Because she is still trying to be polite. Soon she won’t try, when the\nplace has got more into her—she’ll really be it. Without trying.\nNaturally.”"

Instead she sharply\nrapped the little table-gong by her side, though there was Francesca\nstanding at the sideboard, and said, for she would wait no longer for\nher next course, “Serve me.”And Francesca—it must have been wilful—offered her the maccaroni again.Chapter 10There was no way of getting into or out of the top garden at San\nSalvatore except through the two glass doors, unfortunately side by\nside, of the dining-room and the hall. A person in the garden who\nwished to escape unseen could not, for the person to be escaped from\nwould be met on the way. It was a small, oblong garden, and concealment\nwas impossible. What trees there were—the Judas tree, the tamarisk, the\numbrella-pine—grew close to the low parapets. Rose bushes gave no real\ncover; one step to right or left of them, and the person wishing to be\nprivate was discovered. Only the north-west corner was a little place\njutting out from the great wall, a kind of excrescence or loop, no\ndoubt used in the old distrustful days for observation, where it was\npossible to sit really unseen, because between it and the house was a\nthick clump of daphne."

There was another excrescence on\nthe walls just like it at the north-east corner, but this, though the\nview from it was almost more beautiful, for from it you could see the\nbay and the lovely mountains behind Mezzago, was exposed. No bushes\ngrew near it, nor had it any shade. The north-west loop then was where\nshe would sit, and she settled into it, and nestling her head in her\ncushion and putting her feet comfortably on the parapet, from whence\nthey appeared to the villagers on the piazza below as two white doves,\nthought that now indeed she would be safe.Mrs. Fisher found her there, guided by the smell of her cigarette. The\nincautious Scrap had not thought of that. Mrs. Fisher did not smoke\nherself, and all the more distinctly could she smell the smoke of\nothers. The virile smell met her directly she went out into the garden\nfrom the dining-room after lunch in order to have her coffee. She had\nbidden Francesca set the coffee in the shade of the house just outside\nthe glass door, and when Mrs. Wilkins, seeing a table being carried\nthere, reminded her, very officiously and tactlessly Mrs. Fisher\nconsidered, that Lady Caroline wanted to be alone, she retorted—and\nwith what propriety—that the garden was for everybody.Into it accordingly she went, and was immediately aware that Lady\nCaroline was smoking. She said to herself, “These modern young women,”\nand proceeded to find her; her stick, now that lunch was over, being no\nlonger the hindrance to action that it was before her meal had been\nsecurely, as Browning once said—surely it was Browning? Yes, she\nremembered how much diverted she had been—roped in.Nobody diverted her now, reflected Mrs. Fisher, making straight for the\nclump of daphne; the world had grown very dull, and had entirely lost\nits sense of humour. Probably they still had their jokes, these\npeople—in fact she knew they did, for _Punch_ still went on; but how\ndifferently it went on, and what jokes. Thackeray, in his inimitable\nway, would have made mincemeat of this generation. Of how much it\nneeded the tonic properties of that astringent pen it was of course\nunaware. It no longer even held him—at least, so she had been\ninformed—in any particular esteem. Well, she could not give it eyes to\nsee and ears to hear and a heart to understand, but she could and would\ngive it, represented and united in the form of Lady Caroline, a good\ndose of honest medicine."

Mrs. Fisher did not, and coming inside the loop, sat\ndown on a narrow stone seat built out of the wall. For a little she\ncould sit on it; for a little, till the chill began to penetrate.She contemplated the figure before her. Undoubtedly a pretty creature,\nand one that would have had a success at Farringford. Strange how\neasily even the greatest men were moved by exteriors. She had seen with\nher own eyes Tennyson turn away from everybody—turn, positively, his\nback on a crowd of eminent people assembled to do him honour, and\nwithdraw to the window with a young person nobody had ever heard of,\nwho had been brought there by accident and whose one and only merit—if\nit be a merit, that which is conferred by chance—was beauty. Beauty!\nAll over before you can turn round. An affair, one might almost say, of\nminutes. Well, while it lasted it did seem able to do what it liked\nwith men. Even husbands were not immune. There had been passages in the\nlife of Mr. Fisher . . .“I expect the journey has upset you,” she said in her deep voice. “What\nyou want is a good dose of some simple medicine. I shall ask Domenico\nif there is such a thing in the village as castor oil.”Scrap opened her eyes and looked straight at Mrs. Fisher.“Ah,” said Mrs. Fisher, “I knew you were not asleep.

She ought, with\na throat formation like that, to have been a singer, but in every kind\nof music Scrap was dumb except this one music of the speaking voice;\nand what a fascination, what a spell lay in that. Such was the\nloveliness of her face and the beauty of her colouring that there was\nnot a man into whose eyes at the sight of her there did not leap a\nflame of intensest interest; but, when he heard her voice, the flame in\nthat man’s eyes was caught and fixed. It was the same with every man,\neducated and uneducated, old, young, desirable themselves or\nundesirable, men of her own world and bus-conductors, generals and\nTommies—during the war she had had a perplexing time—bishops equally\nwith vergers—round about her confirmation startling occurrences had\ntaken place—wholesome and unwholesome, rich and penniless, brilliant or\nidiotic; and it made no difference at all what they were, or how long\nand securely married: into the eyes of every one of them, when they saw\nher, leapt this flame, and when they heard her it stayed there."

  "content": "Scrap had had enough of this look. It only led to difficulties. At\nfirst it had delighted her. She had been excited, triumphant. To be\napparently incapable of doing or saying the wrong thing, to be\napplauded, listened to, petted, adored wherever she went, and when she\ncame home to find nothing there either but the most indulgent proud\nfondness—why, how extremely pleasant. And so easy, too. No preparation\nnecessary for this achievement, no hard work, nothing to learn. She\nneed take no trouble. She had only to appear, and presently say\nsomething.But gradually experiences gathered round her. After all, she had to\ntake trouble, she had to make efforts, because, she discovered with\nastonishment and rage, she had to defend herself. That look, that\nleaping look, meant that she was going to be grabbed at. Some of those\nwho had it were more humble than others, especially if they were young,\nbut they all, according to their several ability, grabbed; and she who\nhad entered the world so jauntily, with her head in the air and the\ncompletest confidence in anybody whose hair was grey, began to\ndistrust, and then to dislike, and soon to shrink away from, and\npresently to be indignant. Sometimes it was just as if she didn’t\nbelong to herself, wasn’t her own at all, but was regarded as a\nuniversal thing, a sort of beauty-of-all-work. Really men . . . And she\nfound herself involved in queer, vague quarrels, being curiously hated.\nReally women . . . And when the war came, and she flung herself into it\nalong with everybody else, it finished her. Really generals . . .The war finished Scrap. It killed the one man she felt safe with, whom\nshe would have married, and it finally disgusted her with love. Since\nthen she had been embittered. She was struggling as angrily in the\nsweet stuff of life as a wasp got caught in honey. Just as desperately\ndid she try to unstick her wings. It gave her no pleasure to outdo\nother women; she didn’t want their tiresome men. What could one do with\nmen when one had got them? None of them would talk to her of anything\nbut the things of love, and how foolish and fatiguing that became after\na bit. It was as though a healthy person with a normal hunger was given\nnothing whatever to eat but sugar. Love, love . . . the very word made\nher want to slap somebody. “_Why_ should I love you? _Why_ should I?”\nshe would ask amazed sometimes when somebody was trying—somebody was\nalways trying—to propose to her. But she never got a real answer, only\nfurther incoherence."

  "content": "A deep cynicism took hold of the unhappy Scrap. Her inside grew\nhoary with disillusionment, while her gracious and charming outside\ncontinued to make the world more beautiful. What had the future in it\nfor her? She would not be able, after such a preparation, to take hold\nof it. She was fit for nothing; she had wasted all this time being\nbeautiful. Presently she wouldn’t be beautiful, and what then? Scrap\ndidn’t know what then, it appalled her to wonder even. Tired as she\nwas of being conspicuous she was at least used to that, she had never\nknown anything else; and to become inconspicuous, to fade, to grow\nshabby and dim, would probably be most painful. And once she began,\nwhat years and years of it there would be! Imagine, thought Scrap,\nhaving most of one’s life at the wrong end. Imagine being old for two\nor three times as long as being young. Stupid, stupid. Everything was\nstupid. There wasn’t a thing she wanted to do. There were thousands\nof things she didn’t want to do. Avoidance, silence, invisibility, if\npossible unconsciousness—these negations were all she asked for at the\nmoment; and here, even here, she was not allowed a minute’s peace, and\nthis absurd woman must come pretending, merely because she wanted to\nexercise power and make her go to bed and make her—hideous—drink castor\noil, that she thought she was ill.“I’m sure,” said Mrs. Fisher, who felt the cold of the stone beginning\nto come through and knew she could not sit much longer, “you’ll do what\nis reasonable. Your mother would wish—have you a mother?”A faint wonder came into Scrap’s eyes. Have you a mother? If ever\nanybody had a mother it was Scrap. It had not occurred to her that\nthere could be people who had never heard of her mother. She was one of\nthe major marchionesses—there being, as no one knew better than Scrap,\nmarchionesses and marchionesses—and had held high positions at Court.\nHer father, too, in his day had been most prominent. His day was a\nlittle over, poor dear, because in the war he had made some important\nmistakes, and besides he was now grown old; still, there he was, an\nexcessively well-known person. How restful, how extraordinarily restful\nto have found some one who had never heard of any of her lot, or at\nleast had not yet connected her with them.She began to like Mrs. Fisher. Perhaps the originals didn’t know\nanything about her either. When she first wrote to them and signed her\nname, that great name of Dester which twisted in and out of English\nhistory like a bloody thread, for its bearers constantly killed, she\nhad taken it for granted that they would know who she was; and at the\ninterview in Shaftesbury Avenue she was sure they did know, because\nthey hadn’t asked, as they otherwise would have, for references.Scrap began to cheer up. If nobody at San Salvatore had ever heard of\nher, if for a whole month she could shed herself, get right away from\neverything connected with herself, be allowed really to forget the\nclinging and the clogging and all the noise, why, perhaps she might\nmake something of herself after all. She might really think; really\nclear up her mind; really come to some conclusion."

That’s all. It isn’t much to want, is it? Just that.”She gazed at Mrs. Fisher, and thought that almost any conclusion would\ndo; the great thing was to get hold of something, catch something\ntight, cease to drift.Mrs. Fisher’s little eyes surveyed her. “I should say,” she said, “that\nwhat a young woman like you wants is a husband and children.”“Well, that’s one of the things I’m going to consider,” said Scrap\namiably. “But I don’t think it would be a conclusion.”“And meanwhile,” said Mrs. Fisher, getting up, for the cold of the\nstone was now through, “I shouldn’t trouble my head if I were you with\nconsiderings and conclusions. Women’s heads weren’t made for thinking,\nI assure you. I should go to bed and get well.”“I am well,” said Scrap.“Then why did you send a message that you were ill?”“I didn’t.”“Then I’ve had all the trouble of coming out here for nothing.”“But wouldn’t you prefer coming out and finding me well than coming out\nand finding me ill?” asked Scrap, smiling.Even Mrs. Fisher was caught by the smile.“Well, you’re a pretty creature,” she said forgivingly. “It’s a pity\nyou weren’t born fifty years ago. My friends would have liked looking\nat you.”“I’m very glad I wasn’t,” said Scrap. “I dislike being looked at.”“Absurd,” said Mrs. Fisher, growing stern again. “That’s what you are\nmade for, young women like you. For what else, pray? And I assure you\nthat if my friends had looked at you, you would have been looked at by\nsome very great people.”“I dislike very great people,” said Scrap, frowning. There had been an\nincident quite recently—really potentates. . .“What _I_ dislike,” said Mrs. Fisher, now as cold as the stone she had\ngot up from, “is the pose of the modern young woman. It seems to me\npitiful, positively pitiful, in its silliness.”And, her stick crunching the pebbles, she walked away.“That’s all right,” Scrap said to herself, dropping back into her\ncomfortable position with her head in the cushion and her feet on the\nparapet; if only people would go away she didn’t in the least mind why\nthey went."

What? Peculiar? Well, let her be peculiar if she likes. A woman\nwith her looks can be any damned thing she pleases,” was the infatuated\nanswer.“I do let her,” said her mother meekly; and indeed if she did not, what\ndifference would it make?Mrs. Fisher was sorry she had bothered about Lady Caroline. She went\nalong the hall towards her private sitting-room, and her stick as she\nwent struck the stone floor with a vigour in harmony with her feelings.\nSheer silliness, these poses. She had no patience with them. Unable to\nbe or do anything of themselves, the young of the present generation\ntried to achieve a reputation for cleverness by decrying all that was\nobviously great and obviously good and by praising everything, however\nobviously bad, that was different. Apes, thought Mrs. Fisher, roused.\nApes. Apes. And in her sitting-room she found more apes, or what seemed\nto her in her present mood more, for there was Mrs. Arbuthnot placidly\ndrinking coffee, while at the writing-table, the writing-table she\nalready looked upon as sacred, using her pen, her own pen brought for\nher hand alone from Prince of Wales Terrace, sat Mrs. Wilkins writing;\nat the table; in her room; with her pen.“Isn’t this a delightful place?” said Mrs. Arbuthnot cordially. “We\nhave just discovered it.”“I’m writing to Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins, turning her head and also\ncordially—as though, Mrs. Fisher thought, she cared a straw who she was\nwriting to and anyhow knew who the person she called Mellersh was.\n“He’ll want to know,” said Mrs. Wilkins, optimism induced by her\nsurroundings, “that I’ve got here safely.”Chapter 11"

  "content": "The sweet smells that were everywhere in San Salvatore were alone\nenough to produce concord. They came into the sitting-room from the\nflowers on the battlements, and met the ones from the flowers inside\nthe room, and almost, thought Mrs. Wilkins, could be seen greeting each\nother with a holy kiss. Who could be angry in the middle of such\ngentlenesses? Who could be acquisitive, selfish, in the old rasped\nLondon way, in the presence of this bounteous beauty?Yet Mrs. Fisher seemed to be all three of these things.There was so much beauty, so much more than enough for every one, that\nit did appear to be a vain activity to try and make a corner in it.Yet Mrs. Fisher was trying to make a corner in it, and had railed off a\nportion for her exclusive use.Well, she would get over that presently; she would get over it\ninevitably, Mrs. Wilkins was sure, after a day or two in the\nextraordinary atmosphere of peace in that place.Meanwhile she obviously hadn’t even begun to get over it. She stood\nlooking at her and Rose with an expression that appeared to be one of\nanger. Anger. Fancy. Silly old nerve-racked London feelings, thought\nMrs. Wilkins, whose eyes saw the room full of kisses, and everybody in\nit being kissed, Mrs. Fisher as copiously as she herself and Rose.“You don’t like us being in here,” said Mrs. Wilkins, getting up and at\nonce, after her manner, fixing on the truth. “Why?”“I should have thought,” said Mrs. Fisher leaning on her stick, “you\ncould have seen that it is my room.”“You mean because of the photographs,” said Mrs. Wilkins.Mrs. Arbuthnot, who was a little red and surprised, got up too.“And the notepaper,” said Mrs. Fisher. “Notepaper with my London\naddress on it. That pen—”She pointed. It was still in Mrs. Wilkins’s hand.“Is yours. I’m very sorry,” said Mrs. Wilkins, laying it on the table.\nAnd she added smiling, that it had just been writing some very amiable\nthings.“But why,” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, who found herself unable to acquiesce\nin Mrs. Fisher’s arrangements without at least a gentle struggle,\n“ought we not to be here? It’s a sitting-room.”“There is another one,” said Mrs. Fisher. “You and your friend cannot\nsit in two rooms at once, and if I have no wish to disturb you in yours\nI am unable to see why you should wish to disturb me in mine.”“But why—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot again."

  "content": "“It’s quite natural,” Mrs. Wilkins interrupted, for Rose was looking\nstubborn; and turning to Mrs. Fisher she said that although sharing\nthings with friends was pleasant she could understand that Mrs. Fisher,\nstill steeped in the Prince of Wales Terrace attitude to life, did not\nyet want to, but that she would get rid of that after a bit and feel\nquite different. “Soon you’ll want us to share,” said Mrs. Wilkins\nreassuringly. “Why, you may even get so far as _asking_ me to use your\npen if you knew I hadn’t got one.”Mrs. Fisher was moved almost beyond control by this speech. To have a\nramshackle young woman from Hampstead patting her on the back as it\nwere, in breezy certitude that quite soon she would improve, stirred\nher more deeply than anything had stirred her since her first discovery\nthat Mr. Fisher was not what he seemed. Mrs. Wilkins must certainly be\ncurbed. But how? There was a curious imperviousness about her. At that\nmoment, for instance, she was smiling as pleasantly and with as\nunclouded a face as if she were saying nothing in the least\nimpertinent. Would she know she was being curbed? If she didn’t know,\nif she were too tough to feel it, then what? Nothing, except avoidance;\nexcept, precisely, one’s own private sitting-room.“I’m an old woman,” said Mrs. Fisher, “and I need a room to myself. I\ncannot get about, because of my stick. As I cannot get about I have to\nsit. Why should I not sit quietly and undisturbed, as I told you in\nLondon I intended to? If people are to come in and out all day long,\nchattering and leaving doors open, you will have broken the agreement,\nwhich was that I was to be quiet.”“But we haven’t the least wish—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot, who was again\ncut short by Mrs. Wilkins.“We’re only too glad,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “for you to have this room if\nit makes you happy. We didn’t know about it, that’s all. We wouldn’t\nhave come in if we had—not till you invited us, anyhow. I expect,” she\nfinished looking down cheerfully at Mrs. Fisher, “you soon will.” And\npicking up her letter she took Mrs. Arbuthnot’s hand and drew her\ntowards the door."

  "content": "Mrs. Arbuthnot did not want to go. She, the mildest of women, was\nfilled with a curious and surely unchristian desire to stay and fight.\nNot, of course, really, nor even with any definitely aggressive words.\nNo; she only wanted to reason with Mrs. Fisher, and to reason\npatiently. But she did feel that something ought to be said, and that\nshe ought not to allow herself to be rated and turned out as if she\nwere a schoolgirl caught in ill behaviour by Authority.Mrs. Wilkins, however, drew her firmly to and through the door, and\nonce again Rose wondered at Lotty, at her balance, her sweet and\nequable temper—she who in England had been such a thing of gusts. From\nthe moment they got into Italy it was Lotty who seemed the elder. She\ncertainly was very happy; blissful, in fact. Did happiness so\ncompletely protect one? Did it make one so untouchable, so wise? Rose\nwas happy herself, but not anything like _so_ happy. Evidently not, for\nnot only did she want to fight Mrs. Fisher but she wanted something\nelse, something more than this lovely place, something to complete it;\nshe wanted Frederick. For the first time in her life she was surrounded\nby perfect beauty, and her one thought was to show it to him, to share\nit with him. She wanted Frederick. She yearned for Frederick. Ah, if\nonly, only Frederick . . .“Poor old thing,” said Mrs. Wilkins, shutting the door gently on Mrs.\nFisher and her triumph. “Fancy on a day like this.”“She’s a very rude old thing,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“She’ll get over that. I’m sorry we chose just her room to go and sit\nin.”“It’s much the nicest,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. “And it isn’t hers.”“Oh but there are lots of other places, and she’s such a poor old\nthing. Let her have the room. Whatever does it matter?”And Mrs. Wilkins said she was going down to the village to find out\nwhere the post-office was and post her letter to Mellersh, and would\nRose go too.“I’ve been thinking about Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins as they walked,\none behind the other, down the narrow zigzag path up which they had\nclimbed in the rain the night before.She went first. Mrs. Arbuthnot, quite naturally now, followed. In\nEngland it had been the other way about—Lotty, timid, hesitating,\nexcept when she burst out so awkwardly, getting behind the calm and\nreasonable Rose whenever she could.“I’ve been thinking about Mellersh,” repeated Mrs. Wilkins over her\nshoulder, as Rose seemed not to have heard."
