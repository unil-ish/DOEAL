  "content": "“It’s quite natural,” Mrs. Wilkins interrupted, for Rose was looking\nstubborn; and turning to Mrs. Fisher she said that although sharing\nthings with friends was pleasant she could understand that Mrs. Fisher,\nstill steeped in the Prince of Wales Terrace attitude to life, did not\nyet want to, but that she would get rid of that after a bit and feel\nquite different. “Soon you’ll want us to share,” said Mrs. Wilkins\nreassuringly. “Why, you may even get so far as _asking_ me to use your\npen if you knew I hadn’t got one.”Mrs. Fisher was moved almost beyond control by this speech. To have a\nramshackle young woman from Hampstead patting her on the back as it\nwere, in breezy certitude that quite soon she would improve, stirred\nher more deeply than anything had stirred her since her first discovery\nthat Mr. Fisher was not what he seemed. Mrs. Wilkins must certainly be\ncurbed. But how? There was a curious imperviousness about her. At that\nmoment, for instance, she was smiling as pleasantly and with as\nunclouded a face as if she were saying nothing in the least\nimpertinent. Would she know she was being curbed? If she didn’t know,\nif she were too tough to feel it, then what? Nothing, except avoidance;\nexcept, precisely, one’s own private sitting-room.“I’m an old woman,” said Mrs. Fisher, “and I need a room to myself. I\ncannot get about, because of my stick. As I cannot get about I have to\nsit. Why should I not sit quietly and undisturbed, as I told you in\nLondon I intended to? If people are to come in and out all day long,\nchattering and leaving doors open, you will have broken the agreement,\nwhich was that I was to be quiet.”“But we haven’t the least wish—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot, who was again\ncut short by Mrs. Wilkins.“We’re only too glad,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “for you to have this room if\nit makes you happy. We didn’t know about it, that’s all. We wouldn’t\nhave come in if we had—not till you invited us, anyhow. I expect,” she\nfinished looking down cheerfully at Mrs. Fisher, “you soon will.” And\npicking up her letter she took Mrs. Arbuthnot’s hand and drew her\ntowards the door."

  "content": "Mrs. Arbuthnot did not want to go. She, the mildest of women, was\nfilled with a curious and surely unchristian desire to stay and fight.\nNot, of course, really, nor even with any definitely aggressive words.\nNo; she only wanted to reason with Mrs. Fisher, and to reason\npatiently. But she did feel that something ought to be said, and that\nshe ought not to allow herself to be rated and turned out as if she\nwere a schoolgirl caught in ill behaviour by Authority.Mrs. Wilkins, however, drew her firmly to and through the door, and\nonce again Rose wondered at Lotty, at her balance, her sweet and\nequable temper—she who in England had been such a thing of gusts. From\nthe moment they got into Italy it was Lotty who seemed the elder. She\ncertainly was very happy; blissful, in fact. Did happiness so\ncompletely protect one? Did it make one so untouchable, so wise? Rose\nwas happy herself, but not anything like _so_ happy. Evidently not, for\nnot only did she want to fight Mrs. Fisher but she wanted something\nelse, something more than this lovely place, something to complete it;\nshe wanted Frederick. For the first time in her life she was surrounded\nby perfect beauty, and her one thought was to show it to him, to share\nit with him. She wanted Frederick. She yearned for Frederick. Ah, if\nonly, only Frederick . . .“Poor old thing,” said Mrs. Wilkins, shutting the door gently on Mrs.\nFisher and her triumph. “Fancy on a day like this.”“She’s a very rude old thing,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“She’ll get over that. I’m sorry we chose just her room to go and sit\nin.”“It’s much the nicest,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. “And it isn’t hers.”“Oh but there are lots of other places, and she’s such a poor old\nthing. Let her have the room. Whatever does it matter?”And Mrs. Wilkins said she was going down to the village to find out\nwhere the post-office was and post her letter to Mellersh, and would\nRose go too.“I’ve been thinking about Mellersh,” said Mrs. Wilkins as they walked,\none behind the other, down the narrow zigzag path up which they had\nclimbed in the rain the night before.She went first. Mrs. Arbuthnot, quite naturally now, followed. In\nEngland it had been the other way about—Lotty, timid, hesitating,\nexcept when she burst out so awkwardly, getting behind the calm and\nreasonable Rose whenever she could.“I’ve been thinking about Mellersh,” repeated Mrs. Wilkins over her\nshoulder, as Rose seemed not to have heard."

  "content": "“Have you?” said Rose, a faint distaste in her voice, for her\nexperiences with Mellersh had not been of a kind to make her enjoy\nremembering him. She had deceived Mellersh; therefore she didn’t like\nhim. She was unconscious that this was the reason of her dislike, and\nthought it was that there didn’t seem to be much, if any, of the grace\nof God about him. And yet how wrong to feel that, she rebuked herself,\nand how presumptuous. No doubt Lotty’s husband was far, far nearer to\nGod than she herself was ever likely to be. Still, she didn’t like him.“I’ve been a mean dog,” said Mrs. Wilkins.“A what?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, incredulous of her hearing.“All this coming away and leaving him in that dreary place while I\nrollick in heaven. He had planned to take me to Italy for Easter\nhimself. Did I tell you?”“No,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot; and indeed she had discouraged talk about\nhusbands. Whenever Lotty had begun to blurt out things she had swiftly\nchanged the conversation. One husband led to another, in conversation\nas well as in life, she felt, and she could not, she would not, talk of\nFrederick. Beyond the bare fact that he was there, he had not been\nmentioned. Mellersh had had to be mentioned, because of his\nobstructiveness, but she had carefully kept him from overflowing\noutside the limits of necessity.“Well, he did,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “He had never done such a thing in\nhis life before, and I was horrified. Fancy—just as I had planned to\ncome to it myself.”She paused on the path and looked up at Rose.“Yes,” said Rose, trying to think of something else to talk about.“Now you see why I say I’ve been a mean dog. _He_ had planned a holiday\nin Italy with me, and _I_ had planned a holiday in Italy leaving him at\nhome. I think,” she went on, her eyes fixed on Rose’s face, “Mellersh\nhas every reason to be both angry and hurt.”"

  "content": "Mrs. Arbuthnot was astonished. The extraordinary quickness with which,\nhour by hour, under her very eyes, Lotty became more selfless,\ndisconcerted her. She was turning into something surprisingly like a\nsaint. Here she was now being affectionate about Mellersh—Mellersh, who\nonly that morning, while they hung their feet into the sea, had seemed\na mere iridescence, Lotty had told her, a thing of gauze. That was only\nthat morning; and by the time they had had lunch Lotty had developed so\nfar as to have got him solid enough again to write to, and to write to\nat length. And now, a few minutes later, she was announcing that he had\nevery reason to be angry with her and hurt, and that she herself had\nbeen—the language was unusual, but it did express real penitence—a mean\ndog.Rose stared at her astonished. If she went on like this, soon a nimbus\nmight be expected round her head, was there already, if one didn’t know\nit was the sun through the tree-trunks catching her sandy hair.A great desire to love and be friends, to love everybody, to be friends\nwith everybody, seemed to be invading Lotty—a desire for sheer\ngoodness. Rose’s own experience was that goodness, the state of being\ngood, was only reached with difficulty and pain. It took a long time to\nget to it; in fact one never did get to it, or, if for a flashing\ninstant one did, it was only for a flashing instant. Desperate\nperseverance was needed to struggle along its path, and all the way was\ndotted with doubts. Lotty simply flew along. She had certainly, thought\nRose, not got rid of her impetuousness. It had merely taken another\ndirection. She was now impetuously becoming a saint. Could one really\nattain goodness so violently? Wouldn’t there be an equally violent\nreaction?“I shouldn’t,” said Rose with caution, looking down into Lotty’s bright\neyes—the path was steep, so that Lotty was well below her—“I shouldn’t\nbe sure of that too quickly.”“But I am sure of it, and I’ve written and told him so.”Rose stared. “Why, but only this morning—” she began.“It’s all in this,” interrupted Lotty, tapping the envelope and looking\npleased.“What—everything?”“You mean about the advertisement and my savings being spent? Oh no—not\nyet. But I’ll tell him all that when he comes.”“When he comes?” repeated Rose.“I’ve invited him to come and stay with us.”Rose could only go on staring.“It’s the least I could do. Besides—look at this.” Lotty waved her\nhand. “Disgusting not to share it. I was a mean dog to go off and leave\nhim, but no dog I’ve ever heard of was ever as mean as I’d be if I\ndidn’t try and persuade Mellersh to come out and enjoy this too. It’s\nbarest decency that he should have some of the fun out of my nest-egg.\nAfter all, he has housed me and fed me for years. One shouldn’t be\nchurlish.”"

  "content": "“But—do you think he’ll come?”“Oh, I _hope_ so,” said Lotty with the utmost earnestness; and added,\n“Poor lamb.”At that Rose felt she would like to sit down. Mellersh a poor lamb?\nThat same Mellersh who a few hours before was mere shimmer? There was a\nseat at the bend of the path, and Rose went to it and sat down. She\nwished to get her breath, gain time. If she had time she might perhaps\nbe able to catch up the leaping Lotty, and perhaps be able to stop her\nbefore she committed herself to what she probably presently would be\nsorry for. Mellersh at San Salvatore? Mellersh, from whom Lotty had\ntaken such pains so recently to escape?“I _see_ him here,” said Lotty, as if in answer to her thoughts.Rose looked at her with real concern: for every time Lotty said in that\nconvinced voice, “I _see_,” what she saw came true. Then it was to be\nsupposed that Mr. Wilkins too would presently come true.“I wish,” said Rose anxiously, “I understood you.”“Don’t try,” said Lotty, smiling.“But I must, because I love you.”“Dear Rose,” said Lotty, swiftly bending down and kissing her.“You’re so quick,” said Rose. “I can’t follow your developments. I\ncan’t keep touch. It was what happened with Freder—”She broke off and looked frightened.“The whole idea of our coming here,” she went on again, as Lotty didn’t\nseem to have noticed, “was to get away, wasn’t it? Well, we’ve got\naway. And now, after only a single day of it, you want to write to the\nvery people—”She stopped.“The very people we were getting away from,” finished Lotty. “It’s\nquite true. It seems idiotically illogical. But I’m so happy, I’m so\nwell, I feel so fearfully wholesome. This place—why, it makes me feel\n_flooded_ with love.”And she stared down at Rose in a kind of radiant surprise.Rose was silent a moment. Then she said, “And do you think it will have\nthe same effect on Mr. Wilkins?”"

  "content": "Lotty laughed. “I don’t know,” she said. “But even if it doesn’t,\nthere’s enough love about to flood fifty Mr. Wilkinses, as you call\nhim. The great thing is to have lots of love _about_. I don’t see,” she\nwent on, “at least I don’t see here, though I did at home, that it\nmatters who loves as long as somebody does. I was a stingy beast at\nhome, and used to measure and count. I had a queer obsession about\njustice. As though justice mattered. As though justice can really be\ndistinguished from vengeance. It’s only love that’s any good. At home I\nwouldn’t love Mellersh unless he loved me back, exactly as much,\nabsolute fairness. Did you ever. And as he didn’t, neither did I, and\nthe _aridity_ of that house! The _aridity_ . . .”Rose said nothing. She was bewildered by Lotty. One odd effect of San\nSalvatore on her rapidly developing friend was her sudden free use of\nrobust words. She had not used them in Hampstead. Beast and dog were\nmore robust than Hampstead cared about. In words, too, Lotty had come\nunchained.But how she wished, oh how Rose wished, that she too could write to her\nhusband and say “Come.” The Wilkins _ménage_, however pompous Mellersh\nmight be, and he had seemed to Rose pompous, was on a healthier, more\nnatural footing than hers. Lotty could write to Mellersh and would get\nan answer. She couldn’t write to Frederick, for only too well did she\nknow he wouldn’t answer. At least, he might answer—a hurried scribble,\nshowing how much bored he was at doing it, with perfunctory thanks for\nher letter. But that would be worse than no answer at all; for his\nhandwriting, her name on an envelope addressed by him, stabbed her\nheart. Too acutely did it bring back the letters of their beginnings\ntogether, the letters from him so desolate with separation, so aching\nwith love and longing. To see apparently one of these very same letters\narrive, and open it and find:Dear Rose—Thanks for letter. Glad you’re having a good time. Don’t\nhurry back. Say if you want any money. Everything going splendidly\nhere.—Yours,\n                                                         Frederick.—no, it couldn’t be borne.“I don’t think I’ll come down to the village with you to-day,” she\nsaid, looking up at Lotty with eyes suddenly gone dim. “I think I want\nto think.”“All right,” said Lotty, at once starting off briskly down the path.\n“But don’t think too long,” she called back over her shoulder. “Write\nand invite him at once.”“Invite whom?” asked Rose, startled.“Your husband.”Chapter 12At the evening meal, which was the first time the whole four sat round\nthe dining-room table together, Scrap appeared."

It certainly ravished Mrs. Wilkins, who could not take\nher eyes off the enchanting figure opposite. It was a shell-pink\ngarment, and clung to the adorable Scrap as though it, too, loved her.“What a beautiful dress!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins eagerly.“What—this old rag?” said Scrap, glancing down at it as if to see which\none she had got on. “I’ve had it a hundred years.” And she concentrated\non her soup.“You must be very cold in it,” said Mrs. Fisher, thin-lipped; for it\nshowed a great deal of Scrap—the whole of her arms, for instance, and\neven where it covered her up it was so thin that you still saw her.“Who—me?” said Scrap, looking up a moment. “Oh, no.”And she continued her soup.“You mustn’t catch a chill, you know,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, feeling\nthat such loveliness must at all costs be preserved unharmed. “There’s\na great difference here when the sun goes down.”“I’m quite warm,” said Scrap, industriously eating her soup.“You look as if you had nothing at all on underneath,” said Mrs.\nFisher.“I haven’t. At least, hardly anything,” said Scrap, finishing her soup.“How very imprudent,” said Mrs. Fisher, “and how highly improper.”Whereupon Scrap stared at her.Mrs. Fisher had arrived at dinner feeling friendly towards Lady\nCaroline. She at least had not intruded into her room and sat at her\ntable and written with her pen. She did, Mrs. Fisher had supposed, know\nhow to behave. Now it appeared that she did not know, for was this\nbehaving, to come dressed—no, undressed—like that to a meal? Such\nbehaviour was not only exceedingly improper but also most\ninconsiderate, for the indelicate creature would certainly catch a\nchill, and then infect the entire party. Mrs. Fisher had a great\nobjection to other people’s chills. They were always the fruit of\nfolly; and then they were handed on to her, who had done nothing at all\nto deserve them.“Bird-brained,” thought Mrs. Fisher, sternly contemplating Lady\nCaroline. “Not an idea in her head except vanity.”“But there are no men here,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “so how can it be\nimproper? Have you noticed,” she inquired of Mrs. Fisher, who\nendeavoured to pretend she did not hear, “how difficult it is to be\nimproper without men?”"

  "content": "Mrs. Fisher neither answered her nor looked at her; but Scrap looked at\nher, and did that with her mouth which in any other mouth would have\nbeen a faint grin. Seen from without, across the bowl of nasturtiums,\nit was the most beautiful of brief and dimpled smiles.She had a very alive sort of face, that one, thought Scrap, observing\nMrs. Wilkins with a dawn of interest. It was rather like a field of\ncorn swept by lights and shadows. Both she and the dark one, Scrap\nnoticed, had changed their clothes, but only in order to put on silk\njumpers. The same amount of trouble would have been enough to dress\nthem properly, reflected Scrap. Naturally they looked like nothing on\nearth in the jumpers. It didn’t matter what Mrs. Fisher wore; indeed,\nthe only thing for her, short of plumes and ermine, was what she did\nwear. But these others were quite young still, and quite attractive.\nThey really definitely had faces. How different life would be for them\nif they made the most of themselves instead of the least. And yet—Scrap\nwas suddenly bored, and turned away her thoughts and absently ate\ntoast. What did it matter? If you did make the best of yourself, you\nonly collected people round you who ended by wanting to grab.“I’ve had the most wonderful day,” began Mrs. Wilkins, her eyes\nshining.Scrap lowered hers. “Oh,” she thought, “she’s going to gush.”“As though anybody were interested in her day,” thought Mrs. Fisher,\nlowering hers also.In fact, whenever Mrs. Wilkins spoke Mrs. Fisher deliberately cast down\nher eyes. Thus would she mark her disapproval. Besides, it seemed the\nonly safe thing to do with her eyes, for no one could tell what the\nuncurbed creature would say next. That which she had just said, for\ninstance, about men—addressed too, to her—what could she mean? Better\nnot conjecture, thought Mrs. Fisher; and her eyes, though cast down,\nyet saw Lady Caroline stretch out her hand to the Chianti flask and\nfill her glass again."

  "content": "Again. She had done it once already, and the fish was only just going\nout of the room. Mrs. Fisher could see that the other respectable\nmember of the party, Mrs. Arbuthnot, was noticing it too. Mrs.\nArbuthnot was, she hoped and believed, respectable and well-meaning. It\nis true she also had invaded her sitting-room, but no doubt she had\nbeen dragged there by the other one, and Mrs. Fisher had little if\nanything against Mrs. Arbuthnot, and observed with approval that she\nonly drank water. That was as it should be. So, indeed, to give her her\ndues, did the freckled one; and very right at their age. She herself\ndrank wine, but with what moderation: one meal, one glass. And she was\nsixty-five, and might properly, and even beneficially, have had at\nleast two.“That,” she said to Lady Caroline, cutting right across what Mrs.\nWilkins was telling them about her wonderful day and indicating the\nwine-glass, “is very bad for you.”Lady Caroline, however, could not have heard, for she continued to sip,\nher elbow on the table, and listen to what Mrs. Wilkins was saying.And what was it she was saying? She had invited somebody to come and\nstay? A man?Mrs. Fisher could not credit her ears. Yet it evidently was a man, for\nshe spoke of the person as he.Suddenly and for the first time—but then this was most important—Mrs.\nFisher addressed Mrs. Wilkins directly. She was sixty-five, and cared\nvery little what sorts of women she happened to be with for a month,\nbut if the women were to be mixed with men it was a different\nproposition altogether. She was not going to be made a cat’s-paw of.\nShe had not come out there to sanction by her presence what used in her\nday to be called fast behaviour. Nothing had been said at the interview\nin London about men; if there had been she would have declined, of\ncourse, to come.“What is his name?” asked Mrs. Fisher, abruptly interposing.Mrs. Wilkins turned to her with a slight surprise. “Wilkins,” she said.“Wilkins?”“Yes.”“Your name?”“And his.”“A relation?”“Not blood.”“A connection?”“A husband.”"

  "content": "Mrs. Fisher once more cast down her eyes. She could not talk to Mrs.\nWilkins. There was something about the things she said. . . “A\nhusband.” Suggesting one of many. Always that unseemly twist to\neverything. Why could she not say “My husband”? Besides, Mrs. Fisher\nhad, she herself knew not for what reason, taken both the Hampstead\nyoung women for widows. War ones. There had been an absence of mention\nof husbands at the interview which would not, she considered, be\nnatural if such persons did after all exist. And if a husband was not a\nrelation, who was? “Not blood.” What a way to talk. Why, a husband was\nthe first of all relations. How well she remembered Ruskin—no, it was\nnot Ruskin, it was the Bible that said a man should leave his father\nand mother and cleave only to his wife; showing that she became by\nmarriage an even more than blood relation. And if the husband’s father\nand mother were to be nothing to him compared to his wife, how much\nless than nothing ought the wife’s father and mother be to her compared\nto her husband. She herself had been unable to leave her father and\nmother in order to cleave to Mr. Fisher because they were no longer,\nwhen she married, alive, but she certainly would have left them if they\nhad been there to leave. Not blood, indeed. Silly talk.The dinner was very good. Succulence succeeded succulence. Costanza had\ndetermined to do as she chose in the matter of cream and eggs the first\nweek, and see what happened at the end of it when the bills had to be\npaid. Her experience of the English was that they were quiet about\nbills. They were shy of words. They believed readily. Besides, who was\nthe mistress here? In the absence of a definite one, it occurred to\nCostanza that she might as well be the mistress herself. So she did as\nshe chose about the dinner, and it was very good.The four, however, were so much preoccupied by their own conversation\nthat they ate it without noticing how good it was. Even Mrs. Fisher,\nshe who in such matters was manly, did not notice. The entire excellent\ncooking was to her as though it were not; which shows how much she must\nhave been stirred.She was stirred. It was that Mrs. Wilkins. She was enough to stir\nanybody. And she was undoubtedly encouraged by Lady Caroline, who, in\nher turn, was no doubt influenced by the Chianti.Mrs. Fisher was very glad there were no men present, for they certainly\nwould have been foolish about Lady Caroline. She was precisely the sort\nof young woman to unbalance them; especially, Mrs. Fisher recognised,\nat that moment. Perhaps it was the Chianti momentarily intensifying her\npersonality, but she was undeniably most attractive; and there were few\nthings Mrs. Fisher disliked more than having to look on while sensible,\nintelligent men, who the moment before were talking seriously and\ninterestingly about real matters, became merely foolish and\nsimpering—she had seen them actually simpering—just because in walked a\nbit of bird-brained beauty. Even Mr. Gladstone, that great wise\nstatesman, whose hand had once rested for an unforgettable moment\nsolemnly on her head, would have, she felt, on perceiving Lady Caroline\nleft off talking sense and horribly embarked on badinage."

So\nnow I’m doing it.”“I don’t remember that,” said Mrs. Fisher, her eyes on her plate.“Oh yes, we did—didn’t we, Rose?”“Yes—I remember,” said Lady Caroline. “Only it seemed so incredible\nthat one could ever want to. One’s whole idea was to get away from\none’s friends.”“And one’s husbands.”Again that unseemly plural. But how altogether unseemly, thought Mrs.\nFisher. Such implications. Mrs. Arbuthnot clearly thought so too, for\nshe had turned red.“And family affection,” said Lady Caroline—or was it the Chianti\nspeaking? Surely it was the Chianti.“And the want of family affection,” said Mrs. Wilkins—what a light she\nwas throwing on her home life and real character.“That wouldn’t be so bad,” said Lady Caroline. “I’d stay with that. It\nwould give one room.”“Oh no, no—it’s dreadful,” cried Mrs. Wilkins. “It’s as if one had no\nclothes on.”“But I like that,” said Lady Caroline.“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.“It’s a divine feeling, getting rid of things,” said Lady Caroline, who\nwas talking altogether to Mrs. Wilkins and paid no attention to the\nother two.“Oh, but in a bitter wind to have nothing on and know there never will\nbe anything on and you going to get colder and colder till at last you\ndie of it—that’s what it was like, living with somebody who didn’t love\none.”These confidences, thought Mrs. Fisher . . . and no excuse whatever for\nMrs. Wilkins, who was making them entirely on plain water. Mrs.\nArbuthnot, judging from her face, quite shared Mrs. Fisher’s\ndisapproval; she was fidgeting.“But didn’t he?” asked Lady Caroline—every bit as shamelessly\nunreticent as Mrs. Wilkins.“Mellersh? He showed no signs of it.”“Delicious,” murmured Lady Caroline.“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.“I didn’t think it was at all delicious. I was miserable. And now,\nsince I’ve been here, I simply stare at myself being miserable. As\nmiserable as that. And about Mellersh.”“You mean he wasn’t worth it.”“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.“No, I don’t. I mean I’ve suddenly got well.”"

It\nsounds like a bird.”“It is a poem,” said Mrs. Fisher with extraordinary frost.“Oh,” said Scrap.“I’ll lend it to you,” said Mrs. Wilkins, over whose face laughter\nrippled.“No,” said Scrap.“And its author,” said Mrs. Fisher icily, “though not perhaps quite\nwhat one would have wished him to be, was frequently at my father’s\ntable.”“What a bore for you,” said Scrap. “That’s what mother’s always\ndoing—inviting authors. I hate authors. I wouldn’t mind them so much if\nthey didn’t write books. Go on about Mellersh,” she said, turning to\nMrs. Wilkins.“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.“All those empty beds,” said Mrs. Wilkins.“What empty beds?” asked Scrap.“The ones in this house. Why, of course they each ought to have\nsomebody happy inside them. Eight beds, and only four people. It’s\ndreadful, dreadful to be so greedy and keep everything just for\noneself. I want Rose to ask her husband out too. You and Mrs. Fisher\nhaven’t got husbands, but why not give some friend a glorious time?”Rose bit her lip. She turned red, she turned pale. If only Lotty would\nkeep quiet, she thought. It was all very well to have suddenly become a\nsaint and want to love everybody, but need she be so tactless? Rose\nfelt that all her poor sore places were being danced on. If only Lotty\nwould keep quiet . . .And Mrs. Fisher, with even greater frostiness than that with which she\nhad received Lady Caroline’s ignorance of the Blessed Damozel, said,\n“There is only one unoccupied bedroom in this house.”“Only one?” echoed Mrs. Wilkins, astonished. “Then who are in all the\nothers?”“We are,” said Mrs. Fisher."

That\nleaves two over, and the owner told us there were eight beds—didn’t he\nRose?”“There are six bedrooms,” said Mrs. Fisher; for both she and Lady\nCaroline had thoroughly searched the house on arriving, in order to see\nwhich part of it they would be most comfortable in, and they both knew\nthat there were six bedrooms, two of which were very small, and in one\nof these small ones Francesca slept in the company of a chair and a\nchest of drawers, and the other, similarly furnished, was empty.Mrs. Wilkins and Mrs. Arbuthnot had hardly looked at the house, having\nspent most of their time out-of-doors gaping at the scenery, and had,\nin the agitated inattentiveness of their minds when first they began\nnegotiating for San Salvatore, got into their heads that the eight beds\nof which the owner spoke were the same as eight bedrooms; which they\nwere not. There were indeed eight beds, but four of them were in Mrs.\nWilkins’s and Mrs. Arbuthnot’s rooms.“There are six bedrooms,” repeated Mrs. Fisher. “We have four,\nFrancesca has the fifth, and the sixth is empty.”“So that,” said Scrap, “however kind we feel we would be if we could,\nwe can’t. Isn’t it fortunate?”“But then there’s only room for one?” said Mrs. Wilkins, looking round\nat the three faces.“Yes—and you’ve got him,” said Scrap."

When there were plenty of\nrooms and enough servants there was no reason why they should, as they\ndid in their small, two-servanted house at home, share the same one.\nLove, even universal love, the kind of love with which she felt herself\nflooded, should not be tried. Much patience and self-effacement were\nneeded for successful married sleep. Placidity; a steady faith; these\ntoo were needed. She was sure she would be much fonder of Mellersh, and\nhe not mind her nearly so much, if they were not shut up together at\nnight, if in the morning they could meet with the cheery affection of\nfriends between whom lies no shadow of differences about the window or\nthe washing arrangements, or of absurd little choked-down resentments\nat something that had seemed to one of them unfair. Her happiness, she\nfelt, and her ability to be friends with everybody, was the result of\nher sudden new freedom and its peace. Would there be that sense of\nfreedom, that peace, after a night shut up with Mellersh? Would she be\nable in the morning to be full towards him, as she was at that moment\nfull, of nothing at all but loving-kindness? After all, she hadn’t been\nvery long in heaven. Suppose she hadn’t been in it long enough for her\nto have become fixed in blandness? And only that morning what an\nextraordinary joy it had been to find herself alone when she woke, and\nable to pull the bed-clothes any way she liked!Francesca had to nudge her. She was so much absorbed that she did not\nnotice the pudding.“If,” thought Mrs. Wilkins, distractedly helping herself, “I share my\nroom with Mellersh I risk losing all I now feel about him. If on the\nother hand I put him in the one spare-room, I prevent Mrs. Fisher and\nLady Caroline from giving somebody a treat. True they don’t seem to\nwant to at present, but at any moment in this place one or the other of\nthem may be seized with a desire to make somebody happy, and then they\nwouldn’t be able to because of Mellersh.”“What a problem,” she said aloud, her eyebrows puckered.“What is?” asked Scrap.“Where to put Mellersh.”Scrap stared. “Why, isn’t one room enough for him?” she asked.“Oh yes, quite. But then there won’t be any room left at all—any room\nfor somebody you may want to invite.”“I shan’t want to,” said Scrap.“Or _you_,” said Mrs. Wilkins to Mrs. Fisher. “Rose, of course, doesn’t\ncount. I’m sure she would like sharing her room with her husband. It’s\nwritten all over her.”“Really—” said Mrs. Fisher.“Really what?” asked Mrs. Wilkins, turning hopefully to her, for she\nthought the word this time was the preliminary to a helpful suggestion.It was not. It stood by itself. It was, as before, mere frost.Challenged, however, Mrs. Fisher did fasten it on to a sentence.\n“Really am I to understand,” she asked, “that you propose to reserve\nthe one spare-room for the exclusive use of your own family?”“He isn’t my own family,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “He’s my husband. You\nsee—”“I see nothing,” Mrs. Fisher could not this time refrain from\ninterrupting—for what an intolerable trick. “At the most I hear, and\nthat reluctantly.”But Mrs. Wilkins, as impervious to rebuke as Mrs. Fisher had feared,\nimmediately repeated the tiresome formula and launched out into a long\nand excessively indelicate speech about the best place for the person\nshe called Mellersh to sleep in."

She herself, as if foreseeing his arrival, had had a\nsecond bed put in Mrs. Wilkins’s room. There were certain things in\nlife which were never talked about but only done. Most things connected\nwith husbands were not talked about; and to have a whole dinner-table\ntaken up with a discussion as to where one of them should sleep was an\naffront to the decencies. How and where husbands slept should be known\nonly to their wives. Sometimes it was not known to them, and then the\nmarriage had less happy moments; but these moments were not talked\nabout either; the decencies continued to be preserved. At least, it was\nso in her day. To have to hear whether Mr. Wilkins should or should not\nsleep with Mrs. Wilkins, and the reasons why he should and the reasons\nwhy he shouldn’t, was both uninteresting and indelicate.She might have succeeded in imposing propriety and changing the\nconversation if it had not been for Lady Caroline. Lady Caroline\nencouraged Mrs. Wilkins, and threw herself into the discussion with\nevery bit as much unreserve as Mrs. Wilkins herself. No doubt she was\nimpelled on this occasion by Chianti, but whatever the reason there it\nwas. And, characteristically, Lady Caroline was all for Mr. Wilkins\nbeing given the solitary spare-room. She took that for granted. Any\nother arrangement would be impossible, she said; her expression was,\n“Barbarous.” Had she never read her Bible, Mrs. Fisher was tempted to\ninquire—_And they two shall be one flesh?_ Clearly also, then, one\nroom. But Mrs. Fisher did not inquire. She did not care even to allude\nto such texts to some one unmarried.However, there was one way she could force Mr. Wilkins into his proper\nplace and save the situation: she could say she herself intended to\ninvite a friend. It was her right. They had all said so. Apart from\npropriety, it was monstrous that Mrs. Wilkins should want to monopolise\nthe one spare-room, when in her own room was everything necessary for\nher husband. Perhaps she really would invite somebody—not invite, but\nsuggest coming. There was Kate Lumley, for instance. Kate could\nperfectly afford to come and pay her share; and she was of her own\nperiod and knew, and had known, most of the people she herself knew and\nhad known. Kate, of course, had only been on the fringe; she used to be\nasked only to the big parties, not to the small ones, and she still was\nonly on the fringe. There were some people who never got off the\nfringe, and Kate was one. Often, however, such people were more\npermanently agreeable to be with than the others, in that they remained\ngrateful."

The poor soul had never married,\nbut then everybody could not expect to marry, and she was quite\ncomfortably off—not too comfortably, but just comfortably enough to pay\nher own expenses if she came and yet be grateful. Yes; Kate was the\nsolution. If she came, at one stroke, Mrs. Fisher saw, would the\nWilkinses be regularised and Mrs. Wilkins be prevented from having more\nthan her share of the rooms. Also, Mrs. Fisher would save herself from\nisolation; spiritual isolation. She desired physical isolation between\nmeals, but she disliked that isolation which is of the spirit. Such\nisolation would, she feared, certainly be hers with these three\nalien-minded young women. Even Mrs. Arbuthnot was, owing to her\nfriendship with Mrs. Wilkins, necessarily alien-minded. In Kate she\nwould have a support. Kate, without intruding on her sitting-room, for\nKate was tractable, would be there at meals to support her.Mrs. Fisher said nothing at the moment; but presently in the\ndrawing-room, when they were gathered round the wood fire—she had\ndiscovered there was no fireplace in her own sitting-room, and\ntherefore she would after all be forced, so long as the evenings\nremained cool, to spend them in the other room—presently, while\nFrancesca was handing coffee round and Lady Caroline was poisoning the\nair with smoke, Mrs. Wilkins, looking relieved and pleased, said:\n“Well, if nobody really wants that room, and wouldn’t use it anyhow, I\nshall be very glad if Mellersh may have it.”“Of course he must have it,” said Lady Caroline.Then Mrs. Fisher spoke.“I have a friend,” she said in her deep voice; and sudden silence fell\nupon the others.“Kate Lumley,” said Mrs. Fisher.Nobody spoke.“Perhaps,” continued Mrs. Fisher, addressing Lady Caroline, “you know\nher?”No, Lady Caroline did not know Kate Lumley; and Mrs. Fisher, without\nasking the others if they did, for she was sure they knew no one,\nproceeded. “I wish to invite her to join me,” said Mrs. Fisher.Complete silence.Then Scrap said, turning to Mrs. Wilkins, “That settles Mellersh,\nthen.”“It settles the question of Mr. Wilkins,” said Mrs. Fisher, “although I\nam unable to understand that there should ever have been a question, in\nthe only way that is right.”“I’m afraid you’re in for it, then,” said Lady Caroline, again to Mrs.\nWilkins. “Unless,” she added, “he can’t come.”But Mrs. Wilkins, her brow perturbed—for suppose after all she were not\nyet quite stable in heaven?—could only say, a little uneasily, “I _see_\nhim here.”Chapter 13The uneventful days—only outwardly uneventful—slipped by in floods of\nsunshine, and the servants, watching the four ladies, came to the\nconclusion there was very little life in them."

There had been stir and enterprise; the boat had\nbeen used; excursions had been made; Beppo’s fly was ordered; people\nfrom Mezzago came over and spent the day; the house rang with voices;\neven sometimes champagne had been drunk. Life was varied, life was\ninteresting. But this? What was this? The servants were not even\nscolded. They were left completely to themselves. They yawned.Perplexing, too, was the entire absence of gentlemen. How could\ngentlemen keep away from so much beauty? For, added up, and even after\nthe subtraction of the old one, the three younger ladies produced a\nformidable total of that which gentlemen usually sought.Also the evident desire of each lady to spend long hours separated from\nthe other ladies puzzled the servants. The result was a deathly\nstillness in the house, except at meal-times. It might have been as\nempty as it had been all the winter, for any sounds of life there were.\nThe old lady sat in her room, alone; the dark-eyed lady wandered off\nalone, loitering, so Domenico told them, who sometimes came across her\nin the course of his duties, incomprehensibly among the rocks; the very\nbeautiful fair lady lay in her low chair in the top garden, alone; the\nless, but still beautiful fair lady went up the hills and stayed up\nthem for hours, alone; and every day the sun blazed slowly round the\nhouse, and disappeared at evening into the sea, and nothing at all had\nhappened.The servants yawned.Yet the four visitors, while their bodies sat—that was Mrs. Fisher’s—or\nlay—that was Lady Caroline’s—or loitered—that was Mrs. Arbuthnot’s—or\nwent in solitude up into the hills—that was Mrs. Wilkins’s—were\nanything but torpid really. Their minds were unusually busy. Even at\nnight their minds were busy, and the dreams they had were clear, thin,\nquick things, entirely different from the heavy dreams of home. There\nwas that in the atmosphere of San Salvatore which produced\nactive-mindedness in all except the natives. They, as before, whatever\nthe beauty around them, whatever the prodigal seasons did, remained\nimmune from thoughts other than those they were accustomed to. All\ntheir lives they had seen, year by year, the amazing recurrent\nspectacle of April in the gardens, and custom had made it invisible to\nthem. They were as blind to it, as unconscious of it, as Domenico’s dog\nasleep in the sun."

Suddenly to be transported to\nthat place where the air was so still that it held its breath, where\nthe light was so golden that the most ordinary things were\ntransfigured—to be transported into that delicate warmth, that\ncaressing fragrance, and to have the old grey castle as the setting,\nand, in the distance, the serene clear hills of Perugini’s backgrounds,\nwas an astonishing contrast. Even Lady Caroline, used all her life to\nbeauty, who had been everywhere and seen everything, felt the surprise\nof it. It was, that year, a particularly wonderful spring, and of all\nthe months at San Salvatore April, if the weather was fine, was best.\nMay scorched and withered; March was restless, and could be hard and\ncold in its brightness; but April came along softly like a blessing,\nand if it were a fine April it was so beautiful that it was impossible\nnot to feel different, not to feel stirred and touched.Mrs. Wilkins, we have seen, responded to it instantly. She, so to\nspeak, at once flung off all her garments and dived straight into\nglory, unhesitatingly, with a cry of rapture.Mrs. Arbuthnot was stirred and touched, but differently. She had odd\nsensations—presently to be described.Mrs. Fisher, being old, was of a closer, more impermeable texture, and\noffered more resistance; but she too had odd sensations, also in their\nplace to be described.Lady Caroline, already amply acquainted with beautiful houses and\nclimates, to whom they could not come quite with the same surprise, yet\nwas very nearly as quick to react as Mrs. Wilkins. The place had an\nalmost instantaneous influence on her as well, and of one part of this\ninfluence she was aware: it had made her, beginning on the very first\nevening, want to think, and acted on her curiously like a conscience.\nWhat this conscience seemed to press upon her notice with an insistence\nthat startled her—Lady Caroline hesitated to accept the word, but it\nwould keep on coming into her head—was that she was tawdry.Tawdry.

What had made her be, she wondered. Now, of course, Mrs.\nWilkins would want to grab, she would want to be inseparable; and the\nthought of a grabbing and an inseparableness that should last four\nweeks made Scrap’s spirit swoon within her. No doubt the encouraged\nMrs. Wilkins would be lurking in the top garden waiting to waylay her\nwhen she went out, and would hail her with morning cheerfulness. How\nmuch she hated being hailed with morning cheerfulness—or indeed, hailed\nat all. She oughtn’t to have encouraged Mrs. Wilkins the night before.\nFatal to encourage. It was bad enough not to encourage, for just\nsitting there and saying nothing seemed usually to involve her, but\nactively to encourage was suicidal. What on earth had made her? Now she\nwould have to waste all the precious time, the precious, lovely time\nfor thinking in, for getting square with herself, in shaking Mrs.\nWilkins off.With great caution and on the tips of her toes, balancing herself\ncarefully lest the pebbles should scrunch, she stole out when she was\ndressed to her corner; but the garden was empty. No shaking off was\nnecessary. Neither Mrs. Wilkins nor anybody else was to be seen. She\nhad it entirely to herself. Except for Domenico, who presently came and\nhovered, watering his plants, again especially all the plants that were\nnearest her, no one came out at all; and when, after a long while of\nfollowing up thoughts which seemed to escape her just as she had got\nthem, and dropping off exhausted to sleep in the intervals of this\nchase, she felt hungry and looked at her watch and saw that it was past\nthree, she realised that nobody had even bothered to call her in to\nlunch. So that, Scrap could not but remark, if any one was shaken off\nit was she herself.Well, but how delightful, and how very new. Now she would really be\nable to think, uninterruptedly. Delicious to be forgotten.Still, she was hungry; and Mrs. Wilkins, after that excessive\nfriendliness the night before, might at least have told her lunch was\nready. And she had really been excessively friendly—so nice about\nMellersh’s sleeping arrangements, wanting him to have the spare-room\nand all. She wasn’t usually interested in arrangements, in fact she\nwasn’t ever interested in them; so that Scrap considered she might be\nsaid almost to have gone out of her way to be agreeable to Mrs.\nWilkins. And, in return, Mrs. Wilkins didn’t even bother whether or not\nshe had any lunch."

They took up an enormous proportion of one’s\ntime; and Mrs. Fisher was, she was afraid, one of those persons who at\nmeals linger. Twice now had she dined with Mrs. Fisher, and each time\nshe had been difficult at the end to dislodge, lingering on slowly\ncracking innumerable nuts and slowly drinking a glass of wine that\nseemed as if it would never be finished. Probably it would be a good\nthing to make a habit of missing lunch, and as it was quite easy to\nhave tea brought out to her, and as she breakfasted in her room, only\nonce a day would she have to sit at the dining-room table and endure\nthe nuts.Scrap burrowed her head comfortably in the cushions, and with her feet\ncrossed on the low parapet gave herself up to more thought. She said to\nherself, as she had said at intervals throughout the morning: Now I’m\ngoing to think. But, never having thought out anything in her life, it\nwas difficult. Extraordinary how one’s attention wouldn’t stay fixed;\nextraordinary how one’s mind slipped sideways. Settling herself down to\na review of her past as a preliminary to the consideration of her\nfuture, and hunting in it to begin with for any justification of that\ndistressing word tawdry, the next thing she knew was that she wasn’t\nthinking about this at all, but had somehow switched on to Mr. Wilkins.Well, Mr. Wilkins was quite easy to think about, though not pleasant.\nShe viewed his approach with misgivings. For not only was it a profound\nand unexpected bore to have a man added to the party, and a man, too,\nof the kind she was sure Mr. Wilkins must be, but she was afraid—and\nher fear was the result of a drearily unvarying experience—that he\nmight wish to hang about her.This possibility had evidently not yet occurred to Mrs. Wilkins, and it\nwas not one to which she could very well draw her attention; not, that\nis, without being too fatuous to live. She tried to hope that Mr.\nWilkins would be a wonderful exception to the dreadful rule. If only he\nwere, she would be so much obliged to him that she believed she might\nreally quite like him."
