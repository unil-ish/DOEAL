  "content": "It might have been Lotty talking. Mr. Wilkins adjusted the single\neyeglass he carried with him for occasions like this, and examined Mrs.\nFisher carefully. Rose looked on, unable not to smile too since Mrs.\nFisher seemed so much amused, though Rose did not quite know why, and\nher smile was a little uncertain, for Mrs. Fisher amused was a new\nsight, not without its awe-inspiring aspects, and had to be got\naccustomed to.What Mrs. Fisher was thinking was how much surprised they would be if\nshe told them of her very odd and exciting sensation of going to come\nout all over buds. They would think she was an extremely silly old\nwoman, and so would she have thought as lately as two days ago; but the\nbud idea was becoming familiar to her, she was more _apprivoisée_ now,\nas dear Matthew Arnold used to say, and though it would undoubtedly be\nbest if one’s appearance and sensations matched, yet supposing they did\nnot—and one couldn’t have everything—was it not better to feel young\nsomewhere rather than old everywhere? Time enough to be old everywhere\nagain, inside as well as out, when she got back to her sarcophagus in\nPrince of Wales Terrace.Yet it is probable that without the arrival of Briggs Mrs. Fisher would\nhave gone on secretly fermenting in her shell. The others only knew her\nas severe. It would have been more than her dignity could bear suddenly\nto relax—especially towards the three young women. But now came the\nstranger Briggs, a stranger who at once took to her as no young man had\ntaken to her in her life, and it was the coming of Briggs and his real\nand manifest appreciation—for just such a grandmother, thought Briggs,\nhungry for home life and its concomitants, would he have liked to\nhave—that released Mrs. Fisher from her shell; and here she was at\nlast, as Lotty had predicted, pleased, good-humoured and benevolent.Lotty, coming back half an hour later from her picnic, and following\nthe sound of voices into the top garden in the hope of still finding\ntea, saw at once what had happened, for Mrs. Fisher at that very moment\nwas laughing.“She’s burst her cocoon,” thought Lotty; and swift as she was in all\nher movements, and impulsive, and also without any sense of propriety\nto worry and delay her, she bent over the back of Mrs. Fisher’s chair\nand kissed her."

  "content": "“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Fisher, starting violently, for such a\nthing had not happened to her since Mr. Fisher’s earlier days, and then\nonly gingerly. This kiss was a real kiss, and rested on Mrs. Fisher’s\ncheek a moment with a strange, soft sweetness.When she saw whose it was, a deep flush spread over her face. Mrs.\nWilkins kissing her and the kiss feeling so affectionate. . . Even if\nshe had wanted to she could not in the presence of the appreciative Mr.\nBriggs resume her cast-off severity and begin rebuking again; but she\ndid not want to. Was it possible Mrs. Wilkins liked her—had liked her\nall this time, while she had been so much disliking her herself? A\nqueer little trickle of warmth filtered through the frozen defences of\nMrs. Fisher’s heart. Somebody young kissing her—somebody young\n_wanting_ to kiss her. . . Very much flushed, she watched the strange\ncreature, apparently quite unconscious she had done anything\nextraordinary, shaking hands with Mr. Briggs, on her husband’s\nintroducing him, and immediately embarking on the friendliest\nconversation with him, exactly as if she had known him all her life.\nWhat a strange creature; what a very strange creature. It was natural,\nshe being so strange, that one should have, perhaps, misjudged her. . .“I’m sure you want some tea,” said Briggs with eager hospitality to\nLotty. He thought her delightful,—freckles, picnic-untidiness and all.\nJust such a sister would he—“This is cold,” he said, feeling the teapot. “I’ll tell Francesca to\nmake you some fresh—”He broke off and blushed. “Aren’t I forgetting myself,” he said,\nlaughing and looking round at them.“Very natural, very natural,” Mr. Wilkins reassured him.“I’ll go and tell Francesca,” said Rose, getting up.“No, no,” said Briggs. “Don’t go away.” And he put his hands to his\nmouth and shouted.“Francesca!” shouted Briggs.She came running. No summons in their experience had been answered by\nher with such celerity.“‘Her Master’s voice,’” remarked Mr. Wilkins; aptly, he considered.“Make fresh tea,” ordered Briggs in Italian. “Quick—quick—” And then\nremembering himself he blushed again, and begged everybody’s pardon.“Very natural, very natural,” Mr. Wilkins reassured him."

  "content": "Briggs then explained to Lotty what he had explained twice already,\nonce to Rose and once to the other two, that he was on his way to Rome\nand thought he would get out at Mezzago and just look in to see if they\nwere comfortable and continue his journey the next day, staying the\nnight in an hotel at Mezzago.“But how ridiculous,” said Lotty. “Of course you must stay here. It’s\nyour house. There’s Kate Lumley’s room,” she added, turning to Mrs.\nFisher. “You wouldn’t mind Mr. Briggs having it for one night? Kate\nLumley isn’t in it, you know,” she said turning to Briggs again and\nlaughing.And Mrs. Fisher to her immense surprise laughed too. She knew that\nat any other time this remark would have struck her as excessively\nunseemly, and yet now she only thought it funny.No indeed, she assured Briggs, Kate Lumley was not in that room. Very\nfortunately, for she was an excessively wide person and the room was\nexcessively narrow. Kate Lumley might get into it, but that was about\nall. Once in, she would fit it so tightly that probably she would never\nbe able to get out again. It was entirely at Mr. Briggs’s disposal, and\nshe hoped he would do nothing so absurd as go to an hotel—he, the owner\nof the whole place.Rose listened to this speech wide-eyed with amazement. Mrs. Fisher\nlaughed very much as she made it. Lotty laughed very much too, and at\nthe end of it bent down and kissed her again—kissed her several times.“So you see, my dear boy,” said Mrs. Fisher, “you must stay here and\ngive us all a great deal of pleasure.”“A great deal indeed,” corroborated Mr. Wilkins heartily.“A very great deal,” repeated Mrs. Fisher, looking exactly like a\npleased mother.“Do,” said Rose, on Briggs’s turning inquiringly to her.“How kind of you all,” he said, his face broad with smiles. “I’d love\nto be a guest here. What a new sensation. And with three such—”He broke off and looked round. “I say,” he asked, “oughtn’t I to have a\nfourth hostess? Francesca said she had four mistresses.”“Yes. There’s Lady Caroline,” said Lotty.“Then hadn’t we better find out first if she invites me too?”“Oh, but she’s sure—” began Lotty.“The daughter of the Droitwiches, Briggs,” said Mr. Wilkins, “is not\nlikely to be wanting in the proper hospitable impulses.”"

  "content": "“The daughter of the—” repeated Briggs; but he stopped dead, for there\nin the doorway was the daughter of the Droitwiches herself; or rather,\ncoming towards him out of the dark doorway into the brightness of the\nsunset, was that which he had not in his life yet seen but only dreamed\nof, his ideal of absolute loveliness.Chapter 19And then when she spoke . . . what chance was there for poor Briggs? He\nwas undone. All Scrap said was, “How do you do,” on Mr. Wilkins\npresenting him, but it was enough; it undid Briggs.From a cheerful, chatty, happy young man, overflowing with life and\nfriendliness, he became silent, solemn, and with little beads on his\ntemples. Also he became clumsy, dropping the teaspoon as he handed her\nher cup, mismanaging the macaroons, so that one rolled on the ground.\nHis eyes could not keep off the enchanting face for a moment; and when\nMr. Wilkins, elucidating him, for he failed to elucidate himself,\ninformed Lady Caroline that in Mr. Briggs she beheld the owner of San\nSalvatore, who was on his way to Rome, but had got out at Mezzago, etc.\netc., and that the other three ladies had invited him to spend the\nnight in what was to all intents and purposes his own house rather than\nan hotel, and Mr. Briggs was only waiting for the seal of her approval\nto this invitation, she being the fourth hostess—when Mr. Wilkins,\nbalancing his sentences and being admirably clear and enjoying the\nsound of his own cultured voice, explained the position in this manner\nto Lady Caroline, Briggs sat and said never a word.A deep melancholy invaded Scrap. The symptoms of the incipient grabber\nwere all there and only too familiar, and she knew that if Briggs\nstayed her rest-cure might be regarded as over.Then Kate Lumley occurred to her. She caught at Kate as at a straw.“It would have been delightful,” she said, faintly smiling at\nBriggs—she could not in decency not smile, at least a little, but even\na little betrayed the dimple, and Briggs’s eyes became more fixed than\never—“I’m only wondering if there is room.”“Yes, there is,” said Lotty. “There’s Kate Lumley’s room.”“I thought,” said Scrap to Mrs. Fisher, and it seemed to Briggs that he\nhad never heard music till now, “your friend was expected immediately.”“Oh, no,” said Mrs. Fisher—with an odd placidness, Scrap thought."

  "content": "“Miss Lumley,” said Mr. Wilkins, “—or should I,” he inquired of Mrs.\nFisher, “say Mrs.?”“Nobody has ever married Kate,” said Mrs. Fisher complacently.“Quite so. Miss Lumley does not arrive to-day in any case, Lady\nCaroline, and Mr. Briggs has—unfortunately, if I may say so—to continue\nhis journey to-morrow, so that his staying would in no way interfere\nwith Miss Lumley’s possible movements.”“Then of course I join in the invitation,” said Scrap, with what was to\nBriggs the most divine cordiality.He stammered something, flushing scarlet, and Scrap thought, “Oh,” and\nturned her head away; but that merely made Briggs acquainted with her\nprofile, and if there existed anything more lovely than Scrap’s full\nface it was her profile.Well, it was only for this one afternoon and evening. He would leave,\nno doubt, the first thing in the morning. It took hours to get to Rome.\nAwful if he hung on till the night train. She had a feeling that the\nprincipal express to Rome passed through at night. Why hadn’t that\nwoman Kate Lumley arrived yet? She had forgotten all about her, but now\nshe remembered she was to have been invited a fortnight ago. What had\nbecome of her? This man, once let in, would come and see her in London,\nwould haunt the places she was likely to go to. He had the makings, her\nexperienced eye could see, of a passionately persistent grabber."

  "content": "“If,” thought Mr. Wilkins, observing Briggs’s face and sudden silence,\n“any understanding existed between this young fellow and Mrs.\nArbuthnot, there is now going to be trouble. Trouble of a different\nnature from the kind I feared, in which Arbuthnot would have played a\nleading part, in fact the part of petitioner, but trouble that may need\nhelp and advice none the less for its not being publicly scandalous.\nBriggs, impelled by his passions and her beauty, will aspire to the\ndaughter of the Droitwiches. She, naturally and properly, will repel\nhim. Mrs. Arbuthnot, left in the cold, will be upset and show it.\nArbuthnot on his arrival will find his wife in enigmatic tears.\nInquiring into their cause, he will be met with an icy reserve. More\ntrouble may then be expected, and in me they will seek and find their\nadviser. When Lotty said Mrs. Arbuthnot wanted her husband, she was\nwrong. What Mrs. Arbuthnot wants is Briggs, and it looks uncommonly as\nif she were not going to get him. Well, I’m their man.”“Where are your things, Mr. Briggs?” asked Mrs. Fisher, her voice round\nwith motherliness. “Oughtn’t they to be fetched?” For the sun was\nnearly in the sea now, and the sweet-smelling April dampness that\nfollowed immediately on its disappearance was beginning to steal into\nthe garden.Briggs started. “My things?” he repeated. “Oh yes—I must fetch them.\nThey’re in Mezzago. I’ll send Domenico. My fly is waiting in the\nvillage. He can go back in it. I’ll go and tell him.”He got up. To whom was he talking? To Mrs. Fisher, ostensibly, yet his\neyes were fixed on Scrap, who said nothing and looked at no one.Then, recollecting himself, he stammered, “I’m awfully sorry—I keep on\nforgetting—I’ll go down and fetch them myself.”“We can easily send Domenico,” said Rose; and at her gentle voice he\nturned his head.Why, there was his friend, the sweet-named lady—but how had she not in\nthis short interval changed! Was it the failing light making her so\ncolourless, so vague-featured, so dim, so much like a ghost? A nice\ngood ghost, of course, and still with a pretty name, but only a ghost.He turned from her to Scrap again, and forgot Rose Arbuthnot’s\nexistence. How was it possible for him to bother about anybody or\nanything else in this first moment of being face to face with his dream\ncome true?Briggs had not supposed or hoped that any one as beautiful as his dream\nof beauty existed. He had never till now met even an approximation.\nPretty women, charming women by the score he had met and properly\nappreciated, but never the real, the godlike thing itself. He used to\nthink, “If ever I saw a perfectly beautiful woman I should die”; and\nthough, having now met what to his ideas was a perfectly beautiful\nwoman, he did not die, he became very nearly as incapable of managing\nhis own affairs as if he had."

  "content": "The others were obliged to arrange everything for him. By questions\nthey extracted from him that his luggage was in the station cloakroom\nat Mezzago, and they sent for Domenico, and, urged and prompted by\neverybody except Scrap, who sat in silence and looked at no one, Briggs\nwas induced to give him the necessary instructions for going back in\nthe fly and bringing out his things.It was a sad sight to see the collapse of Briggs. Everybody noticed it,\neven Rose.“Upon my word,” thought Mrs. Fisher, “the way one pretty face can turn\na delightful man into an idiot is past all patience.”And feeling the air getting chilly, and the sight of the enthralled\nBriggs painful, she went in to order his room to be got ready,\nregretting now that she had pressed the poor boy to stay. She had\nforgotten Lady Caroline’s kill-joy face for the moment, and the more\ncompletely owing to the absence of any ill effects produced by it on\nMr. Wilkins. Poor boy. Such a charming boy too, left to himself. It was\ntrue she could not accuse Lady Caroline of not leaving him to himself,\nfor she was taking no notice of him at all, but that did not help.\nExactly like foolish moths did men, in other respects intelligent,\nflutter round the impassive lighted candle of a pretty face. She had\nseen them doing it. She had looked on only too often. Almost she laid a\nmotherly hand on Briggs’s fair head as she passed him. Poor boy.Then Scrap, having finished her cigarette, got up and went indoors too.\nShe saw no reason why she should sit there in order to gratify Mr.\nBriggs’s desire to stare. She would have liked to stay out longer, to\ngo to her corner behind the daphne bushes and look at the sunset sky\nand watch the lights coming out one by one in the village below and\nsmell the sweet moistness of the evening, but if she did Mr. Briggs\nwould certainly follow her.The old familiar tyranny had begun again. Her holiday of peace and\nliberation was interrupted—perhaps over, for who knew if he would go\naway, after all, to-morrow? He might leave the house, driven out of it\nby Kate Lumley, but there was nothing to prevent his taking rooms in\nthe village and coming up every day. This tyranny of one person over\nanother! And she was so miserably constructed that she wouldn’t even be\nable to frown him down without being misunderstood."

  "content": "Scrap, who loved this time of the evening in her corner, felt indignant\nwith Mr. Briggs who was doing her out of it, and she turned her back on\nthe garden and him and went towards the house without a look or a word.\nBut Briggs, when he realised her intention, leapt to his feet, snatched\nchairs which were not in her way out of it, kicked a footstool which\nwas not in her path on one side, hurried to the door, which stood wide\nopen, in order to hold it open, and followed her through it, walking by\nher side along the hall.What was to be done with Mr. Briggs? Well, it was his hall; she\ncouldn’t prevent his walking along it.“I hope,” he said, not able while walking to take his eyes off her, so\nthat he knocked against several things he would otherwise have\navoided—the corner of a bookcase, an ancient carved cupboard, the table\nwith the flowers on it, shaking the water over—“that you are quite\ncomfortable here? If you’re not I’ll—I’ll flay them alive.”His voice vibrated. What was to be done with Mr. Briggs? She could of\ncourse stay in her room the whole time, say she was ill, not appear at\ndinner; but again, the tyranny of this . . .“I’m very comfortable indeed,” said Scrap.“If I had dreamed you were coming—” he began.“It’s a wonderful old place,” said Scrap, doing her utmost to sound\ndetached and forbidding, but with little hope of success.The kitchen was on this floor, and passing its door, which was open a\ncrack, they were observed by the servants, whose thoughts, communicated\nto each other by looks, may be roughly reproduced by such rude symbols\nas Aha and Oho—symbols which represented and included their\nappreciation of the inevitable, their foreknowledge of the inevitable,\nand their complete understanding and approval.“Are you going upstairs?” asked Briggs, as she paused at the foot of\nthem.“Yes.”“Which room do you sit in? The drawing-room, or the small yellow room?”“In my own room.”So then he couldn’t go up with her; so then all he could do was to wait\ntill she came out again.He longed to ask her which was her own room—it thrilled him to hear her\ncall any room in his house her own room—that he might picture her in\nit. He longed to know if by any happy chance it was his room, for ever\nafter to be filled with her wonder; but he didn’t dare. He would find\nthat out later from some one else—Francesca, anybody.“Then I shan’t see you again till dinner?”“Dinner is at eight,” was Scrap’s evasive answer as she went upstairs.He watched her go."

She saw Lotty and Rose sitting on\nthe end parapet, where she would have liked to have been, and she saw\nMr. Wilkins buttonholing Briggs and evidently telling him the story of\nthe oleander tree in the middle of the garden.Briggs was listening with a patience she thought rather nice, seeing\nthat it was his oleander and his own father’s story. She knew Mr.\nWilkins was telling him the story by his gestures. Domenico had told it\nher soon after her arrival, and he had also told Mrs. Fisher, who had\ntold Mr. Wilkins. Mrs. Fisher thought highly of this story, and often\nspoke of it. It was about a cherrywood walking-stick. Briggs’s father\nhad thrust this stick into the ground at that spot, and said to\nDomenico’s father, who was then the gardener, “Here we will have an\noleander.” And Briggs’s father left the stick in the ground as a\nreminder to Domenico’s father, and presently—how long afterwards nobody\nremembered—the stick began to sprout, and it was an oleander.There stood poor Mr. Briggs being told all about it, and listening to\nthe story he must have known from infancy with patience."

How\nunfortunate, how extremely unfortunate, the determination that seized\npeople to get hold of and engulf other people. If only they could be\ninduced to stand more on their own feet. Why couldn’t Mr. Briggs be\nmore like Lotty, who never wanted anything of anybody, but was complete\nin herself and respected other people’s completeness? One loved being\nwith Lotty. With her one was free, and yet befriended. Mr. Briggs\nlooked so really nice, too. She thought she might like him if only he\nwouldn’t so excessively like her.Scrap felt melancholy. Here she was shut up in her bedroom, which was\nstuffy from the afternoon sun that had been pouring into it, instead of\nout in the cool garden, and all because of Mr. Briggs.Intolerable tyranny, she thought, flaring up. She wouldn’t endure it;\nshe would go out all the same; she would run downstairs while Mr.\nWilkins—really that man was a treasure—held Mr. Briggs down telling him\nabout the oleander, and get out of the house by the front door, and\ntake cover in the shadows of the zigzag path. Nobody could see her\nthere; nobody would think of looking for her there.She snatched up a wrap, for she did not mean to come back for a long\nwhile, perhaps not even to dinner—it would be all Mr. Briggs’s fault if\nshe went dinnerless and hungry—and with another glance out of the\nwindow to see if she were still safe, she stole out and got away to the\nsheltering trees of the zigzag path, and there sat down on one of the\nseats placed at each bend to assist the upward journey of those who\nwere breathless.Ah, this was lovely, thought Scrap with a sigh of relief. How cool. How\ngood it smelt. She could see the quiet water of the little harbour\nthrough the pine trunks, and the lights coming out in the houses on the\nother side, and all round her the green dusk was splashed by the\nrose-pink of the gladioluses in the grass and the white of the crowding\ndaisies.Ah, this was lovely. So still. Nothing moving—not a leaf, not a stalk.\nThe only sound was a dog barking, far away somewhere up on the hills,\nor when the door of the little restaurant in the piazza below was\nopened and there was a burst of voices, silenced again immediately by\nthe swinging to of the door.She drew in a deep breath of pleasure. Ah, this was—Her deep breath was arrested in the middle. What was that?She leaned forward listening, her body tense.Footsteps. On the zigzag path. Briggs. Finding her out.Should she run?"

But the steps were not the steps of Angelo, that\nswift and springy youth; they were slow and considered, and they kept\non pausing.“Some one who isn’t used to hills,” thought Scrap.The idea of going back to the house did not occur to her. She was\nafraid of nothing in life except love. Brigands or murderers as such\nheld no terrors for the daughter of the Droitwiches; she only would\nhave been afraid of them if they left off being brigands and murderers\nand began instead to try and make love.The next moment the footsteps turned the corner of her bit of path, and\nstood still.“Getting his wind,” thought Scrap, not looking round.Then as he—from the sounds of the steps she took them to belong to a\nman—did not move, she turned her head, and beheld with astonishment a\nperson she had seen a good deal of lately in London, the well-known\nwriter of amusing memoirs, Mr. Ferdinand Arundel.She stared. Nothing in the way of being followed surprised her any\nmore, but that he should have discovered where she was surprised her.\nHer mother had promised faithfully to tell no one.“You?” she said, feeling betrayed. “Here?”He came up to her and took off his hat. His forehead beneath the hat\nwas wet with the beads of unaccustomed climbing. He looked ashamed and\nentreating, like a guilty but devoted dog.“You must forgive me,” he said. “Lady Droitwich told me where you were,\nand as I happened to be passing through on my way to Rome I thought I\nwould get out at Mezzago and just look in and see how you were.”“But—didn’t my mother tell you I was doing a rest-cure?”“Yes. She did. And that’s why I haven’t intruded on you earlier in the\nday. I thought you would probably sleep all day, and wake up about now\nso as to be fed.”“But—”“I know. I’ve got nothing to say in excuse.

Also, though it was evident that he admired her, he had\nnot in London grabbed. There he had merely been a good-natured,\nharmless person of entertaining conversation, who helped to make\nluncheons agreeable. Now it appeared that he too was a grabber. Fancy\nfollowing her out there—daring to. Nobody else had. Perhaps her mother\nhad given him the address because she considered him so absolutely\nharmless, and thought he might be useful and see her home.Well, whatever he was he couldn’t possibly give her the trouble an\nactive young man like Mr. Briggs might give her. Mr. Briggs,\ninfatuated, would be reckless, she felt, would stick at nothing, would\nlose his head publicly. She could imagine Mr. Briggs doing things with\nrope-ladders, and singing all night under her window—being really\ndifficult and uncomfortable. Mr. Arundel hadn’t the figure for any kind\nof recklessness. He had lived too long and too well. She was sure he\ncouldn’t sing, and wouldn’t want to. He must be at least forty. How\nmany good dinners could not a man have eaten by the time he was forty?\nAnd if during that time instead of taking exercise he had sat writing\nbooks, he would quite naturally acquire the figure Mr. Arundel had in\nfact acquired—the figure rather for conversation than adventure.Scrap, who had become melancholy at the sight of Briggs, became\nphilosophical at the sight of Arundel. Here he was. She couldn’t send\nhim away till after dinner. He must be nourished.This being so, she had better make the best of it, and do that with a\ngood grace which anyhow wasn’t to be avoided. Besides, he would be a\ntemporary shelter from Mr. Briggs. She was at least acquainted with\nFerdinand Arundel, and could hear news from him of her mother and her\nfriends, and such talk would put up a defensive barrier at dinner\nbetween herself and the approaches of the other one. And it was only\nfor one dinner, and he couldn’t eat _her_.She therefore prepared herself for friendliness. “I’m to be fed,” she\nsaid, ignoring his last remark, “at eight, and you must come up and be\nfed too. Sit down and get cool and tell me how everybody is.”“May I really dine with you? In these travelling things?” he said,\nwiping his forehead before sitting down beside her.She was too lovely to be true, he thought. Just to look at her for an\nhour, just to hear her voice, was enough reward for his journey and his\nfears."

He would talk about anything she wished if only he\nmight be with her for a while and see her and hear her, but he knew\nvery little of the Droitwiches and their friends really—beyond meeting\nthem at those bigger functions where literature is also represented,\nand amusing them at luncheons and dinners, he knew very little of them\nreally. To them he had always remained Mr. Arundel; no one called him\nFerdinand; and he only knew the gossip also available to the evening\npapers and the frequenters of clubs. But he was, however, good at\ninventing; and as soon as he had come to an end of first-hand\nknowledge, in order to answer her inquiries and keep her there to\nhimself he proceeded to invent. It was quite easy to fasten some of the\nentertaining things he was constantly thinking on to other people and\npretend they were theirs. Scrap, who had that affection for her parents\nwhich warms in absence, was athirst for news, and became more and more\ninterested by the news he gradually imparted.At first it was ordinary news. He had met her mother here, and seen her\nthere. She looked very well; she said so and so. But presently the\nthings Lady Droitwich had said took on an unusual quality: they became\namusing.“Mother said _that?_” Scrap interrupted, surprised.And presently Lady Droitwich began to do amusing things as well as say\nthem.“_Mother_ did that?” Scrap inquired, wide-eyed.Arundel warmed to his work. He fathered some of the most entertaining\nideas he had lately had on to Lady Droitwich, and also any charming\nfunny things that had been done—or might have been done, for he could\nimagine almost anything.Scrap’s eyes grew round with wonder and affectionate pride in her\nmother. Why, but how funny—fancy mother. What an old darling. Did she\nreally do that? How perfectly adorable of her. And did she really\nsay—but how wonderful of her to think of it. What sort of a face did\nLloyd George make?She laughed and laughed, and had a great longing to hug her mother, and\nthe time flew, and it grew quite dusk, and it grew nearly dark, and Mr.\nArundel still went on amusing her, and it was a quarter to eight before\nshe suddenly remembered dinner.“Oh, good heavens!” she exclaimed, jumping up.“Yes. It’s late,” said Arundel.“I’ll go on quickly and send the maid to you. I must run, or I’ll never\nbe ready in time—”And she was gone up the path with the swiftness of a young, slender\ndeer.Arundel followed. He did not wish to arrive too hot, so had to go\nslowly. Fortunately he was near the top, and Francesca came down the\npergola to pilot him indoors, and having shown him where he could wash\nshe put him in the empty drawing-room to cool himself by the crackling\nwood fire."

The\ndrawing-room door was open, and the house was quiet with the hush that\nprecedes dinner, when the inhabitants are all shut up in their rooms\ndressing. Briggs in his room was throwing away spoilt tie after spoilt\ntie; Scrap in hers was hurrying into a black frock with a vague notion\nthat Mr. Briggs wouldn’t be able to see her so clearly in black; Mrs.\nFisher was fastening the lace shawl, which nightly transformed her day\ndress into her evening dress, with the brooch Ruskin had given her on\nher marriage, formed of two pearl lilies tied together by a blue enamel\nribbon on which was written in gold letters _Esto perpetua;_ Mr.\nWilkins was sitting on the edge of his bed brushing his wife’s\nhair—thus far in this third week had he progressed in\ndemonstrativeness—while she, for her part, sitting on a chair in front\nof him, put his studs in a clean shirt; and Rose, ready dressed, sat at\nher window considering her day.Rose was quite aware of what had happened to Mr. Briggs. If she had had\nany difficulty about it, Lotty would have removed it by the frank\ncomments she made while she and Rose sat together after tea on the\nwall. Lotty was delighted at more love being introduced into San\nSalvatore, even if it were only one-sided, and said that when once\nRose’s husband was there she didn’t suppose, now that Mrs. Fisher too\nhad at last come unglued—Rose protested at the expression, and Lotty\nretorted that it was in Keats—there would be another place in the world\nmore swarming with happiness than San Salvatore.“Your husband,” said Lotty, swinging her feet, “might be here quite\nsoon, perhaps to-morrow evening if he starts at once, and there’ll be a\nglorious final few days before we all go home refreshed for life. I\ndon’t believe any of us will ever be the same again—and I wouldn’t be a\nbit surprised if Caroline doesn’t end by getting fond of the young man\nBriggs. It’s in the air. You _have_ to get fond of people here.”Rose sat at her window thinking of these things. Lotty’s optimism . . .\nyet it had been justified by Mr. Wilkins; and look, too, at Mrs.\nFisher. If only it would come true as well about Frederick! For Rose,\nwho between lunch and tea had left off thinking about Frederick, was\nnow, between tea and dinner, thinking of him harder than ever."

She could see as well as any one the unusual, the unique\nloveliness of Lady Caroline. How warm, though, things like admiration\nand appreciation made one feel, how capable of really deserving them,\nhow different, how glowing. They seemed to quicken unsuspected\nfaculties into life. She was sure she had been a thoroughly amusing\nwoman between lunch and tea, and a pretty one too. She was quite\ncertain she had been pretty; she saw it in Mr. Briggs’s eyes as clearly\nas in a looking-glass. For a brief space, she thought, she had been\nlike a torpid fly brought back to gay buzzing by the lighting of a fire\nin a wintry room. She still buzzed, she still tingled, just at the\nremembrance. What fun it had been, having an admirer even for that\nlittle while. No wonder people liked admirers. They seemed, in some\nstrange way, to make one come alive.Although it was all over she still glowed with it and felt more\nexhilarated, more optimistic, more as Lotty probably constantly felt,\nthan she had done since she was a girl. She dressed with care, though\nshe knew Mr. Briggs would no longer see her, but it gave her pleasure\nto see how pretty, while she was about it, she could make herself look;\nand very nearly she stuck a crimson camellia in her hair down by her\near. She did hold it there for a minute, and it looked almost sinfully\nattractive and was exactly the colour of her mouth, but she took it out\nagain with a smile and a sigh and put it in the proper place for\nflowers, which is water. She mustn’t be silly, she thought. Think of\nthe poor. Soon she would be back with them again, and what would a\ncamellia behind her ear seem like then? Simply fantastic.But on one thing she was determined: the first thing she would do when\nshe got home would be to have it out with Frederick. If he didn’t come\nto San Salvatore that is what she would do—the very first thing. Long\nago she ought to have done this, but always she had been handicapped,\nwhen she tried to, by being so dreadfully fond of him and so much\nafraid that fresh wounds were going to be given her wretched, soft\nheart. But now let him wound her as much as he chose, as much as he\npossibly could, she would still have it out with him. Not that he ever\nintentionally wounded her; she knew he never meant to, she knew he\noften had no idea of having done it. For a person who wrote books,\nthought Rose, Frederick didn’t seem to have much imagination. Anyhow,\nshe said to herself, getting up from the dressing-table, things\ncouldn’t go on like this. She would have it out with him. This separate\nlife, this freezing loneliness, she had had enough of it. Why shouldn’t\nshe too be happy? Why on earth—the energetic expression matched her\nmood of rebelliousness—shouldn’t she too be loved and allowed to love?"

The fire transformed the room. A dark, ugly room in\nthe daytime, it was transformed just as she had been transformed by the\nwarmth of—no, she wouldn’t be silly; she would think of the poor; the\nthought of them always brought her down to sobriety at once.She peeped in.

And that gorgeous lilac on the table—she must\ngo and put her face in it . . .But she never got to the lilac. She went one step towards it, and then\nstood still, for she had seen the figure looking out of the window in\nthe farthest corner, and it was Frederick.All the blood in Rose’s body rushed to her heart and seemed to stop its\nbeating.Frederick. Come.She stood quite still. He had not heard her. He did not turn round. She\nstood looking at him. The miracle had happened, and he had come.She stood holding her breath. So he needed her, for he had come\ninstantly. So he too must have been thinking, longing . . .Her heart, which had seemed to stop beating, was suffocating her now,\nthe way it raced along. Frederick did love her then—he must love her,\nor why had he come? Something, perhaps her absence, had made him turn\nto her, want her . . . and now the understanding she had made up her\nmind to have with him would be quite—would be quite—easy—Her thoughts wouldn’t go on. Her mind stammered. She couldn’t think.\nShe could only see and feel. She didn’t know how it had happened. It\nwas a miracle. God could do miracles. God had done this one. God\ncould—God could—could—Her mind stammered again, and broke off.“Frederick—” she tried to say; but no sound came, or if it did the\ncrackling of the fire covered it up.She must go nearer. She began to creep towards him—softly, softly."

It made him feel as if he were thirty again instead of\nforty, and Rose were his Rose of twenty, the Rose he had so much adored\nbefore she began to weigh what he did with her idea of right, and the\nbalance went against him, and she had turned strange, and stony, and\nmore and more shocked, and oh, so lamentable. He couldn’t get at her in\nthose days at all; she wouldn’t, she couldn’t understand. She kept on\nreferring everything to what she called God’s eyes—in God’s eyes it\ncouldn’t be right, it wasn’t right. Her miserable face—whatever her\nprinciples did for her they didn’t make her happy—her little miserable\nface, twisted with effort to be patient, had been at last more than he\ncould bear to see, and he had kept away as much as he could. She never\nought to have been the daughter of a low-church rector—narrow devil;\nshe was quite unfitted to stand up against such an upbringing.What had happened, why she was here, why she was his Rose again, passed\nhis comprehension; and meanwhile, and until such time as he understood,\nhe still could kiss. In fact he could not stop kissing; and it was he\nnow who began to murmur, to say love things in her ear under the hair\nthat smelt so sweet and tickled him just as he remembered it used to\ntickle him.And as he held her close to his heart and her arms were soft round his\nneck, he felt stealing over him a delicious sense of—at first he didn’t\nknow what it was, this delicate, pervading warmth, and then he\nrecognised it as security. Yes; security. No need now to be ashamed of\nhis figure, and to make jokes about it so as to forestall other\npeople’s and show he didn’t mind it; no need now to be ashamed of\ngetting hot going up hills, or to torment himself with pictures of how\nhe probably appeared to beautiful young women—how middle-aged, how\nabsurd in his inability to keep away from them. Rose cared nothing for\nsuch things. With her he was safe.

He did for one brief instant, for even\nin moments of love there are brief instants of lucid thought, recognise\nthe immense power of the woman present and being actually held compared\nto that of the woman, however beautiful, who is somewhere else, but\nthat is as far as he got towards remembering Scrap; no farther. She was\nlike a dream, fleeing before the morning light.“When did you start?” murmured Rose, her mouth on his ear. She couldn’t\nlet him go; not even to talk she couldn’t let him go.“Yesterday morning,” murmured Frederick, holding her close. He couldn’t\nlet her go either.“Oh—the very instant then,” murmured Rose.This was cryptic, but Frederick said, “Yes, the very instant,” and\nkissed her neck.“How quickly my letter got to you,” murmured Rose, whose eyes were shut\nin the excess of her happiness.“Didn’t it,” said Frederick, who felt like shutting his eyes himself.So there had been a letter. Soon, no doubt, light would be vouchsafed\nhim, and meanwhile this was so strangely, touchingly sweet, this\nholding his Rose to his heart again after all the years, that he\ncouldn’t bother to try to guess anything. Oh, he had been happy during\nthese years, because it was not in him to be unhappy; besides, how many\ninterests life had had to offer him, how many friends, how much\nsuccess, how many women only too willing to help him to blot out the\nthought of the altered, petrified, pitiful little wife at home who\nwouldn’t spend his money, who was appalled by his books, who drifted\naway and away from him, and always if he tried to have it out with her\nasked him with patient obstinacy what he thought the things he wrote\nand lived by looked in the eyes of God. “No one,” she said once,\n“should ever write a book God wouldn’t like to read. That is the test,\nFrederick.” And he had laughed hysterically, burst into a great shriek\nof laughter, and rushed out of the house, away from her solemn little\nface—away from her pathetic, solemn little face. . ."

How they\nhad dreamed together, he and she, before he struck that vein of\nmemoirs; how they had planned, and laughed, and loved. They had lived\nfor a while in the very heart of poetry. After the happy days came the\nhappy nights, the happy, happy nights, with her asleep close against\nhis heart, with her when he woke in the morning still close against his\nheart, for they hardly moved in their deep, happy sleep. It was\nwonderful to have it all come back to him at the touch of her, at the\nfeel of her face against his—wonderful that she should be able to give\nhim back his youth.“Sweetheart—sweetheart,” he murmured, overcome by remembrance, clinging\nto her now in his turn.“Beloved husband,” she breathed—the bliss of it—the sheer bliss . . .Briggs, coming in a few minutes before the gong went on the chance that\nLady Caroline might be there, was much astonished. He had supposed Rose\nArbuthnot was a widow, and he still supposed it; so that he was much\nastonished.“Well I’m damned,” thought Briggs, quite clearly and distinctly, for\nthe shock of what he saw in the window startled him so much that for a\nmoment he was shaken free of his own confused absorption.Aloud he said, very red, “Oh I say—I beg your pardon”—and then stood\nhesitating, and wondering whether he oughtn’t to go back to his bedroom\nagain.If he had said nothing they would not have noticed he was there, but\nwhen he begged their pardon Rose turned and looked at him as one looks\nwho is trying to remember, and Frederick looked at him too without at\nfirst quite seeing him.They didn’t seem, thought Briggs, to mind or to be at all embarrassed.\nHe couldn’t be her brother; no brother ever brought that look into a\nwoman’s face. It was very awkward. If they didn’t mind, he did. It\nupset him to come across his Madonna forgetting herself.“Is this one of your friends?” Frederick was able after an instant to\nask Rose, who made no attempt to introduce the young man standing\nawkwardly in front of them but continued to gaze at him with a kind of\nabstracted, radiant goodwill.“It’s Mr. Briggs,” said Rose, recognizing him. “This is my husband,”\nshe added.And Briggs, shaking hands, just had time to think how surprising it was\nto have a husband when you were a widow before the gong sounded, and\nLady Caroline would be there in a minute, and he ceased to be able to\nthink at all, and merely became a thing with its eyes fixed on the\ndoor."

Not only were his eyes fixed on the door but his\nwhole body was concentrated on it.Introduced in his turn, Mr. Wilkins was most hospitable and called\nFrederick “sir.”“Well, sir,” said Mr. Wilkins heartily, “here we are, here we are”—and\nhaving gripped his hand with an understanding that only wasn’t mutual\nbecause Arbuthnot did not yet know what he was in for in the way of\ntrouble, he looked at him as a man should, squarely in the eyes, and\nallowed his look to convey as plainly as a look can that in him would\nbe found staunchness, integrity, reliability—in fact a friend in need.\nMrs. Arbuthnot was very much flushed, Mr. Wilkins noticed.
