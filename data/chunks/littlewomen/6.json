  "content": "Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock, one warm\nSeptember afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too\nlazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods; for the day had\nbeen both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could\nlive it over again. The hot weather made him indolent, and he had\nshirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,\ndispleased his grandfather by practising half the afternoon, frightened\nthe maid-servants half out of their wits, by mischievously hinting that\none of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stable-man\nabout some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his\nhammock, to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the\npeace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into\nthe green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams\nof all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean, in a\nvoyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a\nflash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches\ncoming out, as if bound on some expedition.\"What in the world are those girls about now?\" thought Laurie, opening\nhis sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather\npeculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each wore a large, flapping\nhat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long\nstaff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio.\nAll walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate, and\nbegan to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.\"Well, that's cool!\" said Laurie to himself, \"to have a picnic and never\nask me. They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got the key.\nPerhaps they forgot it; I'll take it to them, and see what's going on.\"Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find\none; then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in\nhis pocket; so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the\nfence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the boat-house, he\nwaited for them to appear: but no one came, and he went up the hill to\ntake an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from\nthe heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of\nthe pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.\"Here's a landscape!\" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and\nlooking wide-awake and good-natured already."

Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily with her\nwhite hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose, in her pink\ndress, among the green. Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under\nthe hemlock near by, for she made pretty things of them. Amy was\nsketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud. A\nshadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he\nought to go away, because uninvited; yet lingering, because home seemed\nvery lonely, and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his\nrestless spirit. He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its\nharvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and\nskipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the\nwistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.[Illustration: It was rather a pretty little picture]\"May I come in, please? or shall I be a bother?\" he asked, advancing\nslowly.Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly, and said, at\nonce, \"Of course you may. We should have asked you before, only we\nthought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this.\"\"I always liked your games; but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go away.\"\"I've no objection, if you do something; it's against the rules to be\nidle here,\" replied Meg, gravely but graciously.\"Much obliged; I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for it's as\ndull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read, cone, draw,\nor do all at once? Bring on your bears; I'm ready,\" and Laurie sat down,\nwith a submissive expression delightful to behold.\"Finish this story while I set my heel,\" said Jo, handing him the book.\"Yes'm,\" was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his\ngratitude for the favor of an admission into the \"Busy Bee Society.\"The story was not a long one, and, when it was finished, he ventured to\nask a few questions as a reward of merit.\"Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming\ninstitution is a new one?\"\"Would you tell him?\" asked Meg of her sisters.\"He'll laugh,\" said Amy warningly.\"Who cares?\" said Jo.\"I guess he'll like it,\" added Beth.\"Of course I shall! I give you my word I won't laugh. Tell away, Jo, and\ndon't be afraid.\"\"The idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to play\n'Pilgrim's Progress,' and we have been going on with it in earnest, all\nwinter and summer.\"\"Yes, I know,\" said Laurie, nodding wisely.\"Who told you?\" demanded Jo.\"Spirits.\"\"No, I did; I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away, and\nhe was rather dismal. He did like it, so don't scold, Jo,\" said Beth\nmeekly.\"You can't keep a secret. Never mind; it saves trouble now.\"\"Go on, please,\" said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work, looking\na trifle displeased."

The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,\nand we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.\"\"Yes, I should think so;\" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own idle\ndays.\"Mother likes to have us out of doors as much as possible; so we bring\nour work here, and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our\nthings in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,\nand play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the\n'Delectable Mountain,' for we can look far away and see the country\nwhere we hope to live some time.\"Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine; for through an opening in the\nwood one could look across the wide, blue river, the meadows on the\nother side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills\nthat rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens plowed with\nthe splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds lay on the\nhill-tops; and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white\npeaks, that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.\"How beautiful that is!\" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see and\nfeel beauty of any kind.\"It's often so; and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but\nalways splendid,\" replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.\"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live some time,--the real\ncountry, she means, with pigs and chickens, and haymaking. It would be\nnice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could\never go to it,\" said Beth musingly.\"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we _shall_ go, by and\nby, when we are good enough,\" answered Meg, with her sweet voice.\"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do; I want to fly away at once, as\nthose swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.\"\"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later; no fear of that,\" said Jo;\n\"I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and\nmaybe never get in after all.\""

I always imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the\nshining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor Christian as he\ncomes up from the river.\"\"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could\ncome true, and we could live in them?\" said Jo, after a little pause.\"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have,\"\nsaid Laurie, lying flat, and throwing cones at the squirrel who had\nbetrayed him.\"You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it?\" asked Meg.\"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?\"\"Yes, if the girls will too.\"\"We will. Now, Laurie.\"\"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle in\nGermany, and have just as much music as I choose. I'm to be a famous\nmusician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me; and I'm never\nto be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself, and live\nfor what I like. That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg?\"Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake\nbefore her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said\nslowly, \"I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of luxurious\nthings,--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people,\nand heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like,\nwith plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit. How I should enjoy\nit! for I wouldn't be idle, but do good, and make every one love me\ndearly.\"[Illustration: Waved a brake before her face]\"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?\" asked Laurie\nslyly.\"I said 'pleasant people,' you know;\" and Meg carefully tied up her shoe\nas she spoke, so that no one saw her face."

I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms\npiled with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that my\nworks should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to do something\nsplendid before I go into my castle,--something heroic or wonderful,\nthat won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know what, but I'm on\nthe watch for it, and mean to astonish you all, some day. I think I\nshall write books, and get rich and famous: that would suit me, so that\nis _my_ favorite dream.\"\"Mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother, and help take care\nof the family,\" said Beth contentedly.\"Don't you wish for anything else?\" asked Laurie.\"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we\nmay all keep well and be together; nothing else.\"\"I have ever so many wishes; but the pet one is to be an artist, and go\nto Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole\nworld,\" was Amy's modest desire.\"We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth, wants to\nbe rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if any of\nus will ever get our wishes,\" said Laurie, chewing grass, like a\nmeditative calf.\"I've got the key to my castle in the air; but whether I can unlock the\ndoor remains to be seen,\" observed Jo mysteriously.\"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang college!\"\nmuttered Laurie, with an impatient sigh.\"Here's mine!\" and Amy waved her pencil.\"I haven't got any,\" said Meg forlornly.\"Yes, you have,\" said Laurie at once.\"Where?\"\"In your face.\"\"Nonsense; that's of no use.\"\"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,\" replied\nthe boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he\nfancied he knew."

What a venerable party!\" said Jo.\"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time; but I'm\nsuch a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall 'dawdle,' Jo.\"\"You need a motive, mother says; and when you get it, she is sure you'll\nwork splendidly.\"\"Is she? By Jupiter I will, if I only get the chance!\" cried Laurie,\nsitting up with sudden energy. \"I ought to be satisfied to please\ngrandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see,\nand comes hard. He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and I'd\nrather be shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of\nrubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the\nbottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I\ngive him four years he ought to let me off from the business; but he's\nset, and I 've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and please\nmyself, as my father did. If there was any one left to stay with the old\ngentleman, I'd do it to-morrow.\"Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into\nexecution on the slightest provocation; for he was growing up very fast,\nand, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of\nsubjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.\"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home\nagain till you have tried your own way,\" said Jo, whose imagination was\nfired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was\nexcited by what she called \"Teddy's wrongs.\""

You should do just what your grandfather wishes,\nmy dear boy,\" said Meg, in her most maternal tone. \"Do your best at\ncollege, and, when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he won't\nbe hard or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with\nand love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you left him without\nhis permission. Don't be dismal or fret, but do your duty; and you'll\nget your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved.\"\"What do you know about him?\" asked Laurie, grateful for the good\nadvice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation\nfrom himself, after his unusual outbreak.\"Only what your grandpa told us about him,--how he took good care of his\nown mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice\nperson, because he wouldn't leave her; and how he provides now for an\nold woman who nursed his mother; and never tells any one, but is just as\ngenerous and patient and good as he can be.\"\"So he is, dear old fellow!\" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,\nlooking flushed and earnest with her story. \"It's like grandpa to find\nout all about him, without letting him know, and to tell all his\ngoodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't\nunderstand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me,\nand treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just\nperfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you\nall in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll do for\nBrooke.\"\"Begin to do something now, by not plaguing his life out,\" said Meg\nsharply.\"How do you know I do, miss?\"\"I can always tell by his face, when he goes away. If you have been\ngood, he looks satisfied and walks briskly; if you have plagued him,\nhe's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work\nbetter.\"\"Well, I like that! So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in\nBrooke's face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he passes your window,\nbut I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.\"[Illustration: I see him bow and smile]\"We haven't; don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything!

I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be\nsilly; I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd be\nsorry for, by and by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were our\nbrother, and say just what we think.

For two or three hours the sun\nlay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,\nwriting busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,\nwhile Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied\nby his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of\nhis whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the\nlast page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish, and\nthrew down her pen, exclaiming,--\"There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to wait till\nI can do better.\"Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,\nmaking dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,\nwhich looked like little balloons; then she tied it up with a smart red\nribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression,\nwhich plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo's desk up here\nwas an old tin kitchen, which hung against the wall. In it she kept her\npapers and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being\nlikewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of\nsuch books as were left in his way, by eating the leaves. From this tin\nreceptacle Jo produced another manuscript; and, putting both in her\npocket, crept quietly down stairs, leaving her friends to nibble her\npens and taste her ink.She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and, going to\nthe back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung\nherself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.\nOnce there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled\naway to town, looking very merry and mysterious."

This\nmanœuvre she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a\nblack-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building\nopposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,\npulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if\nshe were going to have all her teeth out.There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,\nand, after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly\nopened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young\ngentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself\nin the opposite door-way, saying, with a smile and a shiver,--\"It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need some\none to help her home.\"In ten minutes Jo came running down stairs with a very red face, and the\ngeneral appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying\nordeal of some sort.

Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare,\ncompared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it be\nfun to see them in print; and sha'n't we feel proud of our authoress?\"Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in; and a\nfriend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.\"Where's _your_ secret?

Laurie reached\nthe goal first, and was quite satisfied with the success of his\ntreatment; for his Atalanta came panting up, with flying hair, bright\neyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.[Illustration: Jo darted away]"

But\nsome one did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking particularly\nladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls.\"What in the world are you doing here?\" she asked, regarding her\ndishevelled sister with well-bred surprise.\"Getting leaves,\" meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had\njust swept up.\"And hair-pins,\" added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap.\n\"They grow on this road, Meg; so do combs and brown straw hats.\"\"You have been running, Jo; how could you?

Don't try to\nmake me grow up before my time, Meg: it's hard enough to have you change\nall of a sudden; let me be a little girl as long as I can.\"As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips;\nfor lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman,\nand Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must surely come\nsome time, and now seemed very near. He saw the trouble in her face, and\ndrew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, \"Where have you been\ncalling, all so fine?\"\"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle\nMoffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend the\nwinter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be!\"\"Do you envy her, Meg?\" said Laurie.\"I'm afraid I do.\"\"I'm glad of it!\" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.\"Why?\" asked Meg, looking surprised.\"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a\npoor man,\" said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to\nmind what she said."

She rushed to the door when the postman rang; was rude to\nMr. Brooke whenever they met; would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone\nface, occasionally jumping up to shake, and then to kiss her, in a very\nmysterious manner; Laurie and she were always making signs to one\nanother, and talking about \"Spread Eagles,\" till the girls declared they\nhad both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the\nwindow, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the\nsight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden, and finally capturing\nher in Amy's bower. What went on there, Meg could not see; but shrieks\nof laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great\nflapping of newspapers.\"What shall we do with that girl?
