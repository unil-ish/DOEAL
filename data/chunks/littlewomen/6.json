You know your castle wouldn't be perfect\nwithout,\" said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather\nscorned romance, except in books.\"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,\"\nanswered Meg petulantly.\"Wouldn't I, though? I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms\npiled with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that my\nworks should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to do something\nsplendid before I go into my castle,--something heroic or wonderful,\nthat won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know what, but I'm on\nthe watch for it, and mean to astonish you all, some day. I think I\nshall write books, and get rich and famous: that would suit me, so that\nis _my_ favorite dream.\"\"Mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother, and help take care\nof the family,\" said Beth contentedly.\"Don't you wish for anything else?\" asked Laurie.\"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we\nmay all keep well and be together; nothing else.\"\"I have ever so many wishes; but the pet one is to be an artist, and go\nto Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole\nworld,\" was Amy's modest desire.\"We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth, wants to\nbe rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if any of\nus will ever get our wishes,\" said Laurie, chewing grass, like a\nmeditative calf.\"I've got the key to my castle in the air; but whether I can unlock the\ndoor remains to be seen,\" observed Jo mysteriously.\"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang college!\"\nmuttered Laurie, with an impatient sigh.\"Here's mine!\" and Amy waved her pencil.\"I haven't got any,\" said Meg forlornly.\"Yes, you have,\" said Laurie at once.\"Where?\"\"In your face.\"\"Nonsense; that's of no use.\"\"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,\" replied\nthe boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he\nfancied he knew."

What a venerable party!\" said Jo.\"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time; but I'm\nsuch a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall 'dawdle,' Jo.\"\"You need a motive, mother says; and when you get it, she is sure you'll\nwork splendidly.\"\"Is she? By Jupiter I will, if I only get the chance!\" cried Laurie,\nsitting up with sudden energy. \"I ought to be satisfied to please\ngrandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see,\nand comes hard. He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and I'd\nrather be shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of\nrubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the\nbottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I\ngive him four years he ought to let me off from the business; but he's\nset, and I 've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and please\nmyself, as my father did. If there was any one left to stay with the old\ngentleman, I'd do it to-morrow.\"Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into\nexecution on the slightest provocation; for he was growing up very fast,\nand, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of\nsubjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.\"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home\nagain till you have tried your own way,\" said Jo, whose imagination was\nfired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was\nexcited by what she called \"Teddy's wrongs.\""

You should do just what your grandfather wishes,\nmy dear boy,\" said Meg, in her most maternal tone. \"Do your best at\ncollege, and, when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he won't\nbe hard or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with\nand love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you left him without\nhis permission. Don't be dismal or fret, but do your duty; and you'll\nget your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved.\"\"What do you know about him?\" asked Laurie, grateful for the good\nadvice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation\nfrom himself, after his unusual outbreak.\"Only what your grandpa told us about him,--how he took good care of his\nown mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice\nperson, because he wouldn't leave her; and how he provides now for an\nold woman who nursed his mother; and never tells any one, but is just as\ngenerous and patient and good as he can be.\"\"So he is, dear old fellow!\" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,\nlooking flushed and earnest with her story. \"It's like grandpa to find\nout all about him, without letting him know, and to tell all his\ngoodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't\nunderstand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me,\nand treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just\nperfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you\nall in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll do for\nBrooke.\"\"Begin to do something now, by not plaguing his life out,\" said Meg\nsharply.\"How do you know I do, miss?\"\"I can always tell by his face, when he goes away. If you have been\ngood, he looks satisfied and walks briskly; if you have plagued him,\nhe's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work\nbetter.\"\"Well, I like that! So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in\nBrooke's face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he passes your window,\nbut I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.\"[Illustration: I see him bow and smile]\"We haven't; don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything! It\nwas only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here is\nsaid in confidence, you know,\" cried Meg, much alarmed at the thought of\nwhat might follow from her careless speech."

I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be\nsilly; I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd be\nsorry for, by and by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were our\nbrother, and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.\" And\nMeg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,\nand said frankly, \"I'm the one to be forgiven; I'm cross, and have been\nout of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults and be\nsisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes; I thank you all the\nsame.\"Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable\nas possible,--wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook\ndown cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a\nfit person to belong to the \"Busy Bee Society.\" In the midst of an\nanimated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those\namiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of\na bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea \"to draw,\" and they would\njust have time to get home to supper.\"May I come again?\" asked Laurie.\"Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are\ntold to do,\" said Meg smiling.\"I'll try.\"\"Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do;\nthere's a demand for socks just now,\" added Jo, waving hers, like a big\nblue worsted banner, as they parted at the gate."

Remembering the conversation of the\nafternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the\nsacrifice cheerfully, \"I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old\ngentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.\"[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Jo was very busy]XIV.SECRETS.Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow\nchilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun\nlay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,\nwriting busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,\nwhile Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied\nby his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of\nhis whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the\nlast page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish, and\nthrew down her pen, exclaiming,--\"There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to wait till\nI can do better.\"Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,\nmaking dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,\nwhich looked like little balloons; then she tied it up with a smart red\nribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression,\nwhich plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo's desk up here\nwas an old tin kitchen, which hung against the wall. In it she kept her\npapers and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being\nlikewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of\nsuch books as were left in his way, by eating the leaves. From this tin\nreceptacle Jo produced another manuscript; and, putting both in her\npocket, crept quietly down stairs, leaving her friends to nibble her\npens and taste her ink.She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and, going to\nthe back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung\nherself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.\nOnce there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled\naway to town, looking very merry and mysterious."

This\nmanœuvre she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a\nblack-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building\nopposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,\npulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if\nshe were going to have all her teeth out.There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,\nand, after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly\nopened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young\ngentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself\nin the opposite door-way, saying, with a smile and a shiver,--\"It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need some\none to help her home.\"In ten minutes Jo came running down stairs with a very red face, and the\ngeneral appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying\nordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked\nanything but pleased, and passed him with a nod; but he followed, asking\nwith an air of sympathy,--\"Did you have a bad time?\"\"Not very.\"\"You got through quickly.\"\"Yes, thank goodness!\"\"Why did you go alone?\"\"Didn't want any one to know.\"\"You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?\"Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him; then began to\nlaugh, as if mightily amused at something.\"There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.\"\"What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo,\" said\nLaurie, looking mystified.\"So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?\"\"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a\ngymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.\"\"I'm glad of that.\"\"Why?\"\"You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and\nwe'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.\"Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several\npassers-by smile in spite of themselves.\"I'll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not; it's grand fun, and will\nstraighten you up capitally. But I don't believe that was your only\nreason for saying 'I'm glad,' in that decided way; was it, now?\"\"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you\nnever go to such places. Do you?\"\"Not often.\"\"I wish you wouldn't.\""

Everything seemed very strange when they went\ndown,--so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.\nBreakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face\nlooked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her night-cap on.\nThe big trunk stood ready in the hall, mother's cloak and bonnet lay on\nthe sofa, and mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and\nworn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to\nkeep their resolution.
