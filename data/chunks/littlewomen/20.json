Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face, and she feared he\nmight think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.\"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been\nso heavenly kind to me?\" he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if\nshe had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily,--\"No, _I_ didn't; I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we\nrather missed you,--father and mother especially.\"\"And you?\"\"I'm always glad to see you, sir.\"In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool, and\nthe frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the Professor,\nfor his smile vanished, as he said gravely,--\"I thank you, and come one time more before I go.\"\"You _are_ going, then?\"\"I haf no longer any business here; it is done.\"\"Successfully, I hope?\" said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment\nwas in that short reply of his.\"I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make\nmy bread and gif my JÃ¼nglings much help.\"\"Tell me, please! I like to know all about the--the boys,\" said Jo\neagerly.\"That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a place in\na college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way\nsmooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be grateful, should I not?\"\"Indeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing what you\nlike, and be able to see you often, and the boys!\" cried Jo, clinging to\nthe lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying.\"Ah! but we shall not meet often, I fear; this place is at the West.\"\"So far away!\" and Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn't\nmatter now what became of her clothes or herself."

He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was,\ntherefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and manner,\nwhich she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was in half a\ndozen different moods in the course of half an hour. When she met him\nshe looked surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that\nshe had come for that express purpose. When he offered her his arm, she\ntook it with a look that filled him with delight; but when he asked if\nshe missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell\nupon him. On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands: was\nthe joy all for the boys? Then, on hearing his destination, she said,\n\"So far away!\" in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of\nhope; but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like\none entirely absorbed in the matter,--\"Here's the place for my errands; will you come in? It won't take long.\"Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and\nparticularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and despatch\nwith which she would accomplish the business. But, owing to the flutter\nshe was in, everything went amiss; she upset the tray of needles, forgot\nthe silesia was to be \"twilled\" till it was cut off, gave the wrong\nchange, and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon\nat the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching her blush and\nblunder; and, as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed to subside,\nfor he was beginning to see that on some occasions women, like dreams,\ngo by contraries.When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful\naspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it, on\nthe whole.\"Should we not do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and\nhaf a farewell feast to-night if I go for my last call at your so\npleasant home?\" he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and\nflowers.\"What will we buy?\" said Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech, and\nsniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went\nin.\"May they haf oranges and figs?\" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.\"They eat them when they can get them.\"\"Do you care for nuts?\"\"Like a squirrel.\"\"Hamburg grapes; yes, we shall surely drink to the Fatherland in those?\"Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn't buy\na frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and done with\nit? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own, and\nfinished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy\ndaisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a\ndemijohn. Then, distorting his pockets with the knobby bundles, and\ngiving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they\ntravelled on again."

Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?\"\"Yes, sir;\" and Jo felt as calm and cool, all of a sudden, as if she had\nstepped into a refrigerator.\"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick, and\nthe husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a\nfriendly thing to take the little mother.\"\"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer. I'm going very fast and he's\ngetting dearer every minute,\" added Jo to herself; then, with a mental\nshake, she entered into the business with an energy which was pleasant\nto behold.Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and\nthen ordered out the shawls. The clerk, being a married man,\ncondescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be\nshopping for their family.\"Your lady may prefer this; it's a superior article, a most desirable\ncolor, quite chaste and genteel,\" he said, shaking out a comfortable\ngray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.[Illustration: Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?]\"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?\" she asked, turning her back to him,\nand feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.\"Excellently well; we will haf it,\" answered the Professor, smiling to\nhimself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters\nlike a confirmed bargain-hunter.\"Now shall we go home?\" he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to\nhim."

  "content": "\"Yes; it's late, and I'm _so_ tired.\" Jo's voice was more pathetic than\nshe knew; for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came\nout, the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the first time\nshe discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and that her\nheart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the latter. Mr.\nBhaer was going away; he only cared for her as a friend; it was all a\nmistake, and the sooner it was over the better. With this idea in her\nhead, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that\nthe daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.\"This is not our omniboos,\" said the Professor, waving the loaded\nvehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.\"I beg your pardon, I didn't see the name distinctly. Never mind, I can\nwalk. I'm used to plodding in the mud,\" returned Jo, winking hard,\nbecause she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away;\nthe sight seemed to touch him very much, for, suddenly stooping down, he\nasked in a tone that meant a great deal,--\"Heart's dearest, why do you cry?\"Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said\nshe wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine\nfib proper to the occasion; instead of which that undignified creature\nanswered, with an irrepressible sob,--\"Because you are going away.\"\"Ach, mein Gott, that is _so_ good!\" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp\nhis hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles. \"Jo, I haf nothing\nbut much love to gif you; I came to see if you could care for it, and I\nwaited to be sure that I was something more than a friend. Am I? Can\nyou make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?\" he added, all in\none breath.\"Oh, yes!\" said Jo; and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both\nhands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that plainly\nshowed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him, even\nthough she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he carried\nit."

  "content": "It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for, even if he had\ndesired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on account\nof the mud; neither could he offer Jo his hand, except figuratively, for\nboth were full; much less could he indulge in tender demonstrations in\nthe open street, though he was near it: so the only way in which he\ncould express his rapture was to look at her, with an expression which\nglorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be\nlittle rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard. If he had not\nloved Jo very much, I don't think he could have done it _then_, for she\nlooked far from lovely, with her skirts in a deplorable state, her\nrubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her bonnet a ruin. Fortunately,\nMr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living, and she found\nhim more \"Jove-like\" than ever, though his hat-brim was quite limp with\nthe little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the\numbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed mending.Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they\nentirely forgot to hail a 'bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious\nof deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody thought, for\nthey were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any\nlife, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the\nplain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven.\nThe Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the world had\nnothing more to offer him in the way of bliss; while Jo trudged beside\nhim, feeling as if her place had always been there, and wondering how\nshe ever could have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first\nto speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks which followed\nher impetuous \"Oh, yes!\" were not of a coherent or reportable\ncharacter.\"Friedrich, why didn't you--\"\"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!\"\ncried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful\ndelight.\"I always call you so to myself--I forgot; but I won't, unless you like\nit.\"\"Like it? it is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say 'thou,' also, and\nI shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.\"\"Isn't 'thou' a little sentimental?\" asked Jo, privately thinking it a\nlovely monosyllable.\"Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and keep\nourselves young mit it. Your English 'you' is so cold, say 'thou,'\nheart's dearest, it means so much to me,\" pleaded Mr. Bhaer, more like a\nromantic student than a grave professor.\"Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?\" asked Jo\nbashfully."

I see so many going to ruin,\nfor want of help at the right minute; I love so to do anything for them;\nI seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and, oh,\nI should _so_ like to be a mother to them!\"Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in\nher eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not\nseen for a long while."

  "content": "\"I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would\nlike, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his dear heart, he's\nbeen doing it all his life,--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting\nrich; that he'll never be; money doesn't stay in his pocket long enough\nto lay up any. But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved me better\nthan I ever deserved, _I'm_ rich, at least I feel so, and we can live at\nPlumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school. It's just the\nplace for boys, the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain.\nThere's plenty of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside.\nThey could help in the garden and orchard: such work is healthy, isn't\nit, sir? Then Fritz can train and teach in his own way, and father will\nhelp him. I can feed and nurse and pet and scold them; and mother will\nbe my stand-by. I've always longed for lots of boys, and never had\nenough; now I can fill the house full, and revel in the little dears to\nmy heart's content. Think what luxury,--Plumfield my own, and a\nwilderness of boys to enjoy it with me!\"As Jo waved her hands, and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off\ninto a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought\nhe'd have an apoplectic fit.\"I don't see anything funny,\" she said gravely, when she could be heard.\n\"Nothing could be more natural or proper than for my Professor to open a\nschool, and for me to prefer to reside on my own estate.\"\"She is putting on airs already,\" said Laurie, who regarded the idea in\nthe light of a capital joke. \"But may I inquire how you intend to\nsupport the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins, I'm\nafraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs. Bhaer.\"\"Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich pupils,\nalso,--perhaps begin with such altogether; then, when I've got a start,\nI can take a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich people's\nchildren often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've seen\nunfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones pushed\nforward, when it's real cruelty. Some are naughty through mismanagement\nor neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best have to get\nthrough the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they need most\npatience and kindness. People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try\nto keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn, all at once, from\npretty children into fine young men. They don't complain much,--plucky\nlittle souls,--but they feel it. I've been through something of it, and\nI know all about it. I've a special interest in such young bears, and\nlike to show them that I see the warm, honest, well-meaning boys'\nhearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads.\nI've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up one boy to be a pride\nand honor to his family?\"\"I'll testify that you tried to do it,\" said Laurie, with a grateful\nlook."

But you are not merely\na business man: you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself,\nand let others go halves, as you always did in the old times. I _am_\nproud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and every one feels\nit, though you won't let them say so. Yes, and when I have my flock,\nI'll just point to you, and say, 'There's your model, my lads.'\"Poor Laurie didn't know where to look; for, man though he was, something\nof the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all\nfaces turn approvingly upon him.\"I say, Jo, that's rather too much,\" he began, just in his old boyish\nway. \"You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,\nexcept by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have rather cast me\noff lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless; so, if I've\ngot on at all, you may thank these two for it;\" and he laid one hand\ngently on his grandfather's white head, the other on Amy's golden one,\nfor the three were never far apart.\"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the\nworld!\" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind\njust then. \"When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as the\nthree I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz were only here, it\nwould be quite a little heaven on earth,\" she added more quietly. And\nthat night, when she went to her room, after a blissful evening of\nfamily counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of happiness\nthat she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near\nher own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen\nin an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before she knew\nwhere she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield. Then a\nfamily of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished\nsurprisingly, poor boys as well as rich; for Mr. Laurence was\ncontinually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the\nBhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for\nits support. In this way the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, and\nfurnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted."

  "content": "Of course it was up-hill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes; but\nthe wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most\nrampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her\n\"wilderness of boys,\" and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented\nhad she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered\nPlumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! There was a sort of\npoetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror\nof the boys for miles round; and now the exiles feasted freely on\nforbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved, and\nplayed cricket in the big field where the irritable \"cow with a crumpled\nhorn\" used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort\nof boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be called the\n\"Bhaer-garten,\" as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its\ninhabitants.It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a\nfortune; but it _was_ just what Jo intended it to be,--\"a happy,\nhomelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness.\"\nEvery room in the big house was soon full; every little plot in the\ngarden soon had its owner; a regular menagerie appeared in barn and\nshed, for pet animals were allowed; and, three times a day, Jo smiled at\nher Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows\nof happy young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes,\nconfiding words, and grateful hearts, full of love for \"Mother Bhaer.\"\nShe had boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not\nangels, by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and\nProfessorin much trouble and anxiety. But her faith in the good spot\nwhich exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing\nlittle ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and, in time, success; for\nno mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as\nbenevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times\nseven. Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads; their\npenitent sniffs and whispers after wrong-doing; their droll or touching\nlittle confidences; their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans; even\ntheir misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.\nThere were slow boys and bashful boys; feeble boys and riotous boys;\nboys that lisped and boys that stuttered; one or two lame ones; and a\nmerry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was\nwelcome to the \"Bhaer-garten,\" though some people predicted that his\nadmission would ruin the school."

She enjoyed it heartily, and found the\napplause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world; for\nnow she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers\nand admirers. As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to\nincrease her happiness,--Rob, named for grandpa, and Teddy, a\nhappy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny\ntemper as well as his mother's lively spirit. How they ever grew up\nalive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and\naunts; but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough\nnurses loved and served them well.There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most\ndelightful was the yearly apple-picking; for then the Marches,\nLaurences, Brookes, and Bhaers turned out in full force, and made a day\nof it. Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals\noccurred,--a mellow October day, when the air was full of an\nexhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise, and the blood dance\nhealthily in the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire;\ngolden-rod and asters fringed the mossy walls; grasshoppers skipped\nbriskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a\nfeast; squirrels were busy with their small harvesting; birds twittered\ntheir adieux from the alders in the lane; and every tree stood ready to\nsend down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake.\nEverybody was there; everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled\ndown; everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or\nsuch a jolly set to enjoy it; and every one gave themselves up to the\nsimple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things\nas care or sorrow in the world.Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and Columella\nto Mr. Laurence, while enjoying--\"The gentle apple's winey juice.\"The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout Teutonic\nknight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made a hook\nand ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the way of\nground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself to the little ones,\nrode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among the\nbirds' nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck. Mrs.\nMarch and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas, sorting\nthe contributions that kept pouring in; while Amy, with a beautiful\nmotherly expression in her face, sketched the various groups, and\nwatched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch\nbeside him."

Little Teddy bore a\ncharmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any\nanxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on\nthe back of another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent\npapa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest\nanything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small\nshoes. She knew that little Ted would turn up again in time, safe and\nrosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty\nwelcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.[Illustration: Teddy bore a charmed life]At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while the\napple-pickers rested, and compared rents and bruises. Then Jo and Meg,\nwith a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the grass,\nfor an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day. The land\nliterally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads\nwere not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of refreshment\nas they liked,--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul.\nThey availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for\nsome tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on\ntheir heads, others lent a charm to leap-frog by eating pie in the\npauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and\napple-turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. The\nlittle girls had a private tea-party, and Ted roved among the edibles at\nhis own sweet will.When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first regular\ntoast, which was always drunk at such times,--\"Aunt March, God bless\nher!\" A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot how much\nhe owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been taught to\nkeep her memory green.\"Now, grandma's sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with three times\nthree!\""

Everybody's health was proposed,\nfrom Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the\nastonished guinea-pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search\nof its young master. Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented the\nqueen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were\ntransported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny presents, some\nof them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments\nto grandma's,--for the children's gifts were all their own. Every stitch\nDaisy's patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed\nwas better than embroidery to Mrs. March; Demi's shoe-box was a miracle\nof mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut; Rob's footstool had\na wiggle in its uneven legs, that she declared was very soothing; and no\npage of the costly book Amy's child gave her was so fair as that on\nwhich appeared, in tipsy capitals, the words,--\"To dear Grandma, from\nher little Beth.\"During this ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared; and, when\nMrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while Teddy\nwiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing.\nThen, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree\nto tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys sung, with all\ntheir hearts, the little song Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and\nthe Professor trained his lads to give with the best effect. This was\nsomething altogether new, and it proved a grand success; for Mrs. March\ncouldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every\none of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little\nquadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and\nher daughters under the festival tree.[Illustration: \"Leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival\n                           tree.\"--Page 583]\"I don't think I ever ought to call myself 'Unlucky Jo' again, when my\ngreatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,\" said Mrs. Bhaer,\ntaking Teddy's little fist out of the milk-pitcher, in which he was\nrapturously churning.\"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long\nago.

I haven't given up the hope that I may write\na good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the better\nfor such experiences and illustrations as these;\" and Jo pointed from\nthe lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the\nProfessor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one\nof the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother,\nsitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in her lap\nand at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which\nnever could grow old to them.\"My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for splendid\nthings, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I\nhad a little home, and John, and some dear children like these.

I've\nbegun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing\nI've ever done. I think so myself, and mean to do it in marble, so that,\nwhatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little angel.\"As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping\nchild in her arms; for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little\ncreature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy's sunshine.\nThis cross was doing much for both father and mother, for one love and\nsorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was growing sweeter,\ndeeper, and more tender; Laurie was growing more serious, strong, and\nfirm; and both were learning that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love\nitself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blest;\nfor--\"Into each life some rain must fall,\n         Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.\"\"She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear.

So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg, 'Thank God,\nI'm a happy woman.'\"\"There's no need for me to say it, for every one can see that I'm far\nhappier than I deserve,\" added Jo, glancing from her good husband to her\nchubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her. \"Fritz is getting\ngray and stout; I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am thirty; we never\nshall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night, for that\nincorrigible Tommy Bangs _will_ smoke sweet-fern cigars under the\nbed-clothes, though he's set himself afire three times already. But in\nspite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of, and\nnever was so jolly in my life. Excuse the remark, but living among boys,\nI can't help using their expressions now and then.\"\"Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,\" began Mrs. March,\nfrightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of\ncountenance.\"Not half so good as yours, mother.
