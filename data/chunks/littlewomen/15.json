  "content": "Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had\nworshipped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. But her reverence for\ngenius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to\nrecover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and\nwomen after all. Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid\nadmiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on\n\"spirit, fire, and dew,\" to behold him devouring his supper with an\nardor which flushed his intellectual countenance. Turning as from a\nfallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her\nromantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\nwith the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with\none of the Madame de Staëls of the age, who looked daggers at another\nCorinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after out-manœuvring her in\nefforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly\nand appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech\nimpossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and\nglacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting themselves to\noysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician, who was\ncharming the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen\nof the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of\nthe party.Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely _désillusionée_,\nthat she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined\nher, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the\nphilosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an\nintellectual tournament in the recess. The conversation was miles beyond\nJo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were\nunknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms; and the\nonly thing \"evolved from her inner consciousness,\" was a bad headache\nafter it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually that the world was\nbeing picked to pieces, and put together on new, and, according to the\ntalkers, on infinitely better principles than before; that religion was\nin a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be\nthe only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any\nsort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came\nover her, as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time\nand space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him\nlooking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.\nHe shook his head, and beckoned her to come away; but she was\nfascinated, just then, by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and\nkept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to\nrely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man, and slow to offer his own opinions,\nnot because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be\nlightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,\nattracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his\nbrows, and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul\nwould be led astray by the rockets, to find, when the display was over,\nthat they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand."

  "content": "He bore it as long as he could; but when he was appealed to for an\nopinion, he blazed up with honest indignation, and defended religion\nwith all the eloquence of truth,--an eloquence which made his broken\nEnglish musical, and his plain face beautiful. He had a hard fight, for\nthe wise men argued well; but he didn't know when he was beaten, and\nstood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he talked, the world got\nright again to Jo; the old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed\nbetter than the new; God was not a blind force, and immortality was not\na pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She felt as if she had solid ground\nunder her feet again; and when Mr. Bhaer paused, out-talked, but not one\nwhit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.She did neither; but she remembered this scene, and gave the Professor\nher heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out\nthen and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent. She\nbegan to see that character is a better possession than money, rank,\nintellect, or beauty; and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man\nhas defined it to be, \"truth, reverence, and good-will,\" then her friend\nFriedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.This belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she coveted his\nrespect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship; and, just when the\nwish was sincerest, she came near losing everything. It all grew out of\na cocked hat; for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her\nlesson, with a paper soldier-cap on his head, which Tina had put there,\nand he had forgotten to take off.\"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,\" thought\nJo, with a smile, as he said \"Goot efening,\" and sat soberly down, quite\nunconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his\nhead-gear, for he was going to read her the \"Death of Wallenstein.\"[Illustration: He doesn't prink at his glass before coming]She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,\nhearty laugh, when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover\nit for himself, and presently forgot all about it; for to hear a German\nread Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. After the reading came\nthe lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night,\nand the cocked-hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment. The Professor\ndidn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last, to ask, with an\nair of mild surprise that was irresistible,--\"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no\nrespect for me, that you go on so bad?\"\"How can I be respectful, sir, when you forget to take your hat off?\"\nsaid Jo."

I see him now; it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my cap.\nWell, it is nothing; but see you, if this lesson goes not well, you too\nshall wear him.\"But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes, because Mr. Bhaer\ncaught sight of a picture on the hat, and, unfolding it, said, with an\nair of great disgust,--\"I wish these papers did not come in the house; they are not for\nchildren to see, nor young people to read. It is not well, and I haf no\npatience with those who make this harm.\"Jo glanced at the sheet, and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a\nlunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like it; but the\nimpulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure, but fear,\nbecause, for a minute, she fancied the paper was the \"Volcano.\" It was\nnot, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that, even if it\nhad been, and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no name\nto betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush;\nfor, though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more than\npeople fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the\nnewspaper offices more than once; but as she never spoke of it, he asked\nno questions, in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it\noccurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it\ntroubled him. He did not say to himself, \"It is none of my business;\nI've no right to say anything,\" as many people would have done; he only\nremembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother's\nlove and father's care; and he was moved to help her with an impulse as\nquick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to\nsave a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his mind in a\nminute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face; and by the time the\npaper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready to say quite\nnaturally, but very gravely,--"

They are made pleasant to some, but\nI would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad\ntrash.\"\"All may not be bad, only silly, you know; and if there is a demand for\nit, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people\nmake an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,\" said\nJo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits\nfollowed her pin.\"There is a demand for whiskey, but I think you and I do not care to\nsell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would\nnot feel that the living _was_ honest. They haf no right to put poison\nin the sugar-plum, and let the small ones eat it. No; they should think\na little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.\"Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in\nhis hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her; for her\ncheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke, and gone\nharmlessly up the chimney.\"I should like much to send all the rest after him,\" muttered the\nProfessor, coming back with a relieved air.Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her\nhard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.\nThen she thought consolingly to herself, \"Mine are not like that; they\nare only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried;\" and taking up her\nbook, she said, with a studious face,--\"Shall we go on, sir? I'll be very good and proper now.\"\"I shall hope so,\" was all he said, but he meant more than she imagined;\nand the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words\n\"Weekly Volcano\" were printed in large type on her forehead."

Being a little short-sighted, Mr.\nBhaer sometimes used eye-glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling to\nsee how they magnified the fine print of her book; now she seemed to\nhave got on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also; for the\nfaults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully, and filled her\nwith dismay.\"They _are_ trash, and will soon be worse than trash if I go on; for\neach is more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on, hurting\nmyself and other people, for the sake of money; I know it's so, for I\ncan't read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of\nit; and what _should_ I do if they were seen at home, or Mr. Bhaer got\nhold of them?\"Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her\nstove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.[Illustration: Jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove]\"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense; I'd better\nburn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up\nwith my gunpowder,\" she thought, as she watched the \"Demon of the Jura\"\nwhisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.But when nothing remained of all her three months' work except a heap of\nashes, and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the\nfloor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.\"I think I haven't done much harm _yet_, and may keep this to pay for my\ntime,\" she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, \"I almost\nwish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient. If I didn't care\nabout doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I\nshould get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that father and\nmother hadn't been so particular about such things.\"Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that \"father and mother\n_were_ particular,\" and pity from your heart those who have no such\nguardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like\nprison-walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations\nto build character upon in womanhood."

  "content": "Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not\npay for her share of the sensation; but, going to the other extreme, as\nis the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs. Sherwood,\nMiss Edgeworth, and Hannah More; and then produced a tale which might\nhave been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral\nwas it. She had her doubts about it from the beginning; for her lively\nfancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she\nwould have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the\nlast century. She sent this didactic gem to several markets, but it\nfound no purchaser; and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood,\nthat morals didn't sell.Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of\nif she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it. The\nonly person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try\njuvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to\nconvert all the world to his particular belief. But much as she liked to\nwrite for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys\nas being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls, because they did not go\nto a particular Sabbath-school, nor all the good infants, who did go, as\nrewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to escorts of\nangels, when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their\nlisping tongues. So nothing came of these trials; and Jo corked up her\ninkstand, and said, in a fit of very wholesome humility,--\"I don't know anything; I'll wait till I do before I try again, and,\nmeantime, 'sweep mud in the street,' if I can't do better; that's\nhonest, at least;\" which decision proved that her second tumble down the\nbean-stalk had done her some good.While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had\nbeen as busy and uneventful as usual; and if she sometimes looked\nserious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. He did\nit so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would\naccept and profit by his reproof; but she stood the test, and he was\nsatisfied; for, though no words passed between them, he knew that she\nhad given up writing. Not only did he guess it by the fact that the\nsecond finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her\nevenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and\nstudied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on\noccupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant."

Every one seemed sorry when the time came; the children\nwere inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all over his\nhead, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.\"Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,\" he said,\nwhen she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard, in the corner,\nwhile she held a little levee on that last evening.She was going early, so she bade them all good-by over night; and when\nhis turn came, she said warmly,--\"Now, sir, you won't forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our\nway, will you? I'll never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to\nknow my friend.\"\"Do you? Shall I come?\" he asked, looking down at her with an eager\nexpression which she did not see.\"Yes, come next month; Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy\nCommencement as something new.\"\"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?\" he said, in an altered\ntone.\"Yes, my boy Teddy; I'm very proud of him, and should like you to see\nhim.\"Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in\nthe prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr. Bhaer's\nface suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a\n\"best friend,\" and, simply because she particularly wished not to look\nas if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush; and the\nmore she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina\non her knee, she didn't know what would have become of her. Fortunately,\nthe child was moved to hug her; so she managed to hide her face an\ninstant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and his own\nchanged again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression, as he\nsaid cordially,--\"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much\nsuccess, and you all happiness.

A call\nat Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn,\nstill further fortified her for the _tête-à-tête_, but when she saw a\nstalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn\nabout and run away.\"Where's the jews-harp, Jo?\" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within\nspeaking distance.\"I forgot it;\" and Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not be\ncalled lover-like.She always used to take his arm on these occasions; now she did not, and\nhe made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly about\nall sorts of far-away subjects, till they turned from the road into the\nlittle path that led homeward through the grove.

We don't agree and we never shall; so\nwe'll be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything\nrash.\"\"Yes, we will if we get the chance,\" muttered Laurie rebelliously.\"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,\" implored\nJo, almost at her wit's end.\"I won't be reasonable; I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible\nview;' it won't help me, and it only makes you harder. I don't believe\nyou've got any heart.\"\"I wish I hadn't!\"There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and, thinking it a good omen,\nLaurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he\nsaid, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously\nwheedlesome before,--\"Don't disappoint us, dear! Every one expects it. Grandpa has set his\nheart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get on without you. Say\nyou will, and let's be happy. Do, do!\"Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of\nmind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that\nshe did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard to do, but\nshe did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.\"I can't say 'Yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll see that I'm\nright, by and by, and thank me for it\"--she began solemnly.\"I'll be hanged if I do!\" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning\nwith indignation at the bare idea."

I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward and\nodd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel,--we\ncan't help it even now, you see,--and I shouldn't like elegant society\nand you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on\nwithout it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and\neverything would be horrid!\"\"Anything more?\" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to\nthis prophetic burst.\"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry. I'm happy\nas I am, and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up\nfor any mortal man.\"\"I know better!\" broke in Laurie. \"You think so now; but there'll come a\ntime when you _will_ care for somebody, and you'll love him\ntremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will, it's your way,\nand I shall have to stand by and see it;\" and the despairing lover cast\nhis hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical,\nif his face had not been so tragical.\"Yes, I _will_ live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love\nhim in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!\" cried Jo,\nlosing patience with poor Teddy. \"I've done my best, but you _won't_ be\nreasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't\ngive. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but\nI'll never marry you; and the sooner you believe it, the better for both\nof us,--so now!\"That speech was like fire to gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as\nif he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply\naway, saying, in a desperate sort of tone,--\"You'll be sorry some day, Jo.\"\"Oh, where are you going?\" she cried, for his face frightened her.\"To the devil!\" was the consoling answer."

He had no thought of a\nmelodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and\ncoat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time\nup the river than he had done in many a race. Jo drew a long breath and\nunclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip\nthe trouble which he carried in his heart.\"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent\nstate of mind, that I sha'n't dare to see him,\" she said; adding, as she\nwent slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,\nand buried it under the leaves,--\"Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.\nI wish he'd love Beth; perhaps he may, in time, but I begin to think I\nwas mistaken about her. Oh dear! how can girls like to have lovers and\nrefuse them. I think it's dreadful.\"Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight\nto Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then broke\ndown, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old\ngentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He\nfound it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie,\nand hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo\nthat love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly, and resolved to\ncarry his boy out of harm's way; for Young Impetuosity's parting words\nto Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.When Laurie came home, dead tired, but quite composed, his grandfather\nmet him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very\nsuccessfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the\ntwilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the\nold man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to\nlisten to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed\nlove's labor lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went to his\npiano, and began to play. The windows were open; and Jo, walking in the\ngarden with Beth, for once understood music better than her sister, for\nhe played the \"Sonata Pathétique,\" and played it as he never did before."

As he\nlistened, he lost his place; the music ended with a broken chord, and\nthe musician sat silent in the dark.\"I can't stand this,\" muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped his\nway to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders, and\nsaid, as gently as a woman,--\"I know, my boy, I know.\"No answer for an instant; then Laurie asked sharply,--\"Who told you?\"\"Jo herself.\"\"Then there's an end of it!\" and he shook off his grandfather's hands\nwith an impatient motion; for, though grateful for the sympathy, his\nman's pride could not bear a man's pity.\"Not quite; I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of\nit,\" returned Mr. Laurence, with unusual mildness. \"You won't care to\nstay at home just now, perhaps?\"\"I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my seeing her,\nand I shall stay and do it as long as I like,\" interrupted Laurie, in a\ndefiant tone.\"Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but the\ngirl can't help it; and the only thing left for you to do is to go away\nfor a time. Where will you go?\"\"Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me;\" and Laurie got up, with a\nreckless laugh, that grated on his grandfather's ear.\"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake. Why not\ngo abroad, as you planned, and forget it?\"\"I can't.\"\"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got\nthrough college.\"\"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!\" and Laurie walked fast through the\nroom, with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.\"I don't ask you to go alone; there's some one ready and glad to go with\nyou, anywhere in the world.\"\"Who, sir?\" stopping to listen.\"Myself.\""

Now, my dear boy, just\nsit quietly down, and hear my plan. It's all settled, and can be carried\nout at once,\" said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man, as if\nfearful that he would break away, as his father had done before him.\"Well, sir, what is it?\" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of interest\nin face or voice.\"There is business in London that needs looking after; I meant you\nshould attend to it; but I can do it better myself, and things here will\nget on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do almost\neverything; I'm merely holding on till you take my place, and can be off\nat any time.\"\"But you hate travelling, sir; I can't ask it of you at your age,\" began\nLaurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go\nalone, if he went at all.The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to\nprevent it; for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that\nit would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling a\nnatural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind\nhim, he said stoutly,--\"Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea; it\nwill do me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for travelling nowadays\nis almost as easy as sitting in a chair.\"A restless movement from Laurie suggested that _his_ chair was not easy,\nor that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily,--"

I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit\nthem; meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you\nwill, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your heart's\ncontent.\"Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken, and the\nworld a howling wilderness; but at the sound of certain words which the\nold gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken\nheart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly\nappeared in the howling wilderness. He sighed, and then said, in a\nspiritless tone,--\"Just as you like, sir; it doesn't matter where I go or what I do.\"\"It does to me, remember that, my lad; I give you entire liberty, but I\ntrust you to make an honest use of it.

During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore\nhimself as young gentlemen usually do in such cases. He was moody,\nirritable, and pensive by turns; lost his appetite, neglected his dress,\nand devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano; avoided Jo,\nbut consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragical\nface that haunted her dreams by night, and oppressed her with a heavy\nsense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his\nunrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to\nattempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this was a\nrelief to his friends; but the weeks before his departure were very\nuncomfortable, and every one rejoiced that the \"poor, dear fellow was\ngoing away to forget his trouble, and come home happy.\" Of course, he\nsmiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by, with the sad\nsuperiority of one who knew that his fidelity, like his love, was\nunalterable."

Jo followed a\nminute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. He did look\nround, came back, put his arms about her, as she stood on the step above\nhim, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both\neloquent and pathetic.\"O Jo, can't you?\"[Illustration: O Jo, can't you?]\"Teddy, dear, I wish I could!\"That was all, except a little pause; then Laurie straightened himself\nup, said \"It's all right, never mind,\" and went away without another\nword. Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo _did_ mind; for while the\ncurly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as if\nshe had stabbed her dearest friend; and when he left her without a look\nbehind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.[Illustration: Tail-piece]XXXVI.BETH'S SECRET.When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in\nBeth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too\ngradually to startle those who saw her daily; but to eyes sharpened by\nabsence, it was very plain; and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she\nsaw her sister's face. It was no paler and but little thinner than in\nthe autumn; yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if\nthe mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining\nthrough the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw\nand felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression\nlost much of its power; for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt\nthat she was better; and, presently, in other cares, Jo for a time\nforgot her fear.But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety\nreturned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and been forgiven;\nbut when she showed her savings and proposed the mountain trip, Beth had\nthanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from home.\nAnother little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and, as\ngrandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth\ndown to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open air, and\nlet the fresh sea-breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks."

Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart\nand Beth's; but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there seemed\nsomething sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to speak. She\nwondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see\nwhat she saw; and, during the quiet weeks, when the shadow grew so plain\nto her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing that it would\ntell itself when Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if\nher sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing\nthrough her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks,\nwith her head in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her,\nand the sea made music at her feet.[Illustration: With her head in Jo's lap, while the wind blew\n                        healthfully over her]One day Beth told her.

But she could not\nfind enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands\nseemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been\ngathering. It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was\nslowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened\ntheir hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her\neyes were too dim for seeing, and, when they cleared, Beth was looking\nup at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say,--\"Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it.

Try to see it so, and don't be troubled\nabout me, because it's best; indeed it is.\"\"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth?

It would have been selfish to\nfrighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and\nyou so happy with Laurie,--at least, I thought so then.\"\"And I thought that you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I\ncouldn't,\" cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,\nand added softly,--\"Then you didn't, deary? I was afraid it was so, and imagined your poor\nlittle heart full of love-lornity all that while.\"\"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?\" asked Beth, as\ninnocently as a child. \"I do love him dearly; he is so good to me, how\ncan I help it?

She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only\nloved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to\nthe dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned,\nbut through which He draws us closer to Himself.
