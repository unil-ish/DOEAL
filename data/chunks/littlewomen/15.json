I can't help it;\nyou know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other people\nif they don't,\" cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly\npatted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted her so\nlong ago.\"They do sometimes,\" said a muffled voice from the post.\"I don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try\nit,\" was the decided answer.There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by\nthe river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said\nvery soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile,--\"Laurie, I want to tell you something.\"He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out, in\na fierce tone--\"_Don't_ tell me that, Jo; I can't bear it now!\"\"Tell what?\" she asked, wondering at his violence.\"That you love that old man.\"\"What old man?\" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.\"That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you\nlove him, I know I shall do something desperate;\" and he looked as if he\nwould keep his word, as he clenched his hands, with a wrathful spark in\nhis eyes.Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself, and said warmly, for she,\ntoo, was getting excited with all this,--\"Don't swear, Teddy! He isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind,\nand the best friend I've got, next to you. Pray, don't fly into a\npassion; I want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my\nProfessor. I haven't the least idea of loving him or anybody else.\"\"But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?\"\"You'll love some one else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this\ntrouble.\"\"I _can't_ love any one else; and I'll never forget you, Jo, never!\nnever!\" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.\"What _shall_ I do with him?\" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more\nunmanageable than she expected. \"You haven't heard what I wanted to tell\nyou. Sit down and listen; for indeed I want to do right and make you\nhappy,\" she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which\nproved that she knew nothing about love."

Now that arrangement was\nnot conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part; for how\n_could_ she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes\nfull of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or\ntwo her hardness of heart had wrung from him? She gently turned his head\naway, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to\ngrow for her sake,--how touching that was, to be sure!--\"I agree with mother that you and I are not suited to each other,\nbecause our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very\nmiserable, if we were so foolish as to--\" Jo paused a little over the\nlast word, but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression,--\"Marry,--no, we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect\nsaint, for you could make me anything you like.\"\"No, I can't. I've tried it and failed, and I won't risk our happiness\nby such a serious experiment. We don't agree and we never shall; so\nwe'll be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything\nrash.\"\"Yes, we will if we get the chance,\" muttered Laurie rebelliously.\"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,\" implored\nJo, almost at her wit's end.\"I won't be reasonable; I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible\nview;' it won't help me, and it only makes you harder. I don't believe\nyou've got any heart.\"\"I wish I hadn't!\"There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and, thinking it a good omen,\nLaurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he\nsaid, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously\nwheedlesome before,--\"Don't disappoint us, dear! Every one expects it. Grandpa has set his\nheart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get on without you. Say\nyou will, and let's be happy. Do, do!\"Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of\nmind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that\nshe did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard to do, but\nshe did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.\"I can't say 'Yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll see that I'm\nright, by and by, and thank me for it\"--she began solemnly.\"I'll be hanged if I do!\" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning\nwith indignation at the bare idea."

I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward and\nodd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel,--we\ncan't help it even now, you see,--and I shouldn't like elegant society\nand you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on\nwithout it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and\neverything would be horrid!\"\"Anything more?\" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to\nthis prophetic burst.\"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry. I'm happy\nas I am, and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up\nfor any mortal man.\"\"I know better!\" broke in Laurie. \"You think so now; but there'll come a\ntime when you _will_ care for somebody, and you'll love him\ntremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will, it's your way,\nand I shall have to stand by and see it;\" and the despairing lover cast\nhis hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical,\nif his face had not been so tragical.\"Yes, I _will_ live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love\nhim in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!\" cried Jo,\nlosing patience with poor Teddy. \"I've done my best, but you _won't_ be\nreasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't\ngive. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but\nI'll never marry you; and the sooner you believe it, the better for both\nof us,--so now!\"That speech was like fire to gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as\nif he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply\naway, saying, in a desperate sort of tone,--\"You'll be sorry some day, Jo.\"\"Oh, where are you going?\" she cried, for his face frightened her.\"To the devil!\" was the consoling answer."

He had no thought of a\nmelodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and\ncoat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time\nup the river than he had done in many a race. Jo drew a long breath and\nunclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip\nthe trouble which he carried in his heart.\"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent\nstate of mind, that I sha'n't dare to see him,\" she said; adding, as she\nwent slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,\nand buried it under the leaves,--\"Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.\nI wish he'd love Beth; perhaps he may, in time, but I begin to think I\nwas mistaken about her. Oh dear! how can girls like to have lovers and\nrefuse them. I think it's dreadful.\"Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight\nto Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then broke\ndown, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old\ngentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He\nfound it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie,\nand hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo\nthat love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly, and resolved to\ncarry his boy out of harm's way; for Young Impetuosity's parting words\nto Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.When Laurie came home, dead tired, but quite composed, his grandfather\nmet him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very\nsuccessfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the\ntwilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the\nold man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to\nlisten to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed\nlove's labor lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went to his\npiano, and began to play. The windows were open; and Jo, walking in the\ngarden with Beth, for once understood music better than her sister, for\nhe played the \"Sonata Path√©tique,\" and played it as he never did before."

As he\nlistened, he lost his place; the music ended with a broken chord, and\nthe musician sat silent in the dark.\"I can't stand this,\" muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped his\nway to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders, and\nsaid, as gently as a woman,--\"I know, my boy, I know.\"No answer for an instant; then Laurie asked sharply,--\"Who told you?\"\"Jo herself.\"\"Then there's an end of it!\" and he shook off his grandfather's hands\nwith an impatient motion; for, though grateful for the sympathy, his\nman's pride could not bear a man's pity.\"Not quite; I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of\nit,\" returned Mr. Laurence, with unusual mildness. \"You won't care to\nstay at home just now, perhaps?\"\"I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my seeing her,\nand I shall stay and do it as long as I like,\" interrupted Laurie, in a\ndefiant tone.\"Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but the\ngirl can't help it; and the only thing left for you to do is to go away\nfor a time. Where will you go?\"\"Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me;\" and Laurie got up, with a\nreckless laugh, that grated on his grandfather's ear.\"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake. Why not\ngo abroad, as you planned, and forget it?\"\"I can't.\"\"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got\nthrough college.\"\"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!\" and Laurie walked fast through the\nroom, with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.\"I don't ask you to go alone; there's some one ready and glad to go with\nyou, anywhere in the world.\"\"Who, sir?\" stopping to listen.\"Myself.\""

Now, my dear boy, just\nsit quietly down, and hear my plan. It's all settled, and can be carried\nout at once,\" said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man, as if\nfearful that he would break away, as his father had done before him.\"Well, sir, what is it?\" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of interest\nin face or voice.\"There is business in London that needs looking after; I meant you\nshould attend to it; but I can do it better myself, and things here will\nget on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do almost\neverything; I'm merely holding on till you take my place, and can be off\nat any time.\"\"But you hate travelling, sir; I can't ask it of you at your age,\" began\nLaurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go\nalone, if he went at all.The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to\nprevent it; for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that\nit would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling a\nnatural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind\nhim, he said stoutly,--\"Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea; it\nwill do me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for travelling nowadays\nis almost as easy as sitting in a chair.\"A restless movement from Laurie suggested that _his_ chair was not easy,\nor that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily,--"

I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit\nthem; meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you\nwill, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your heart's\ncontent.\"Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken, and the\nworld a howling wilderness; but at the sound of certain words which the\nold gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken\nheart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly\nappeared in the howling wilderness. He sighed, and then said, in a\nspiritless tone,--\"Just as you like, sir; it doesn't matter where I go or what I do.\"\"It does to me, remember that, my lad; I give you entire liberty, but I\ntrust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me that, Laurie.\"\"Anything you like, sir.\"\"Good,\" thought the old gentleman. \"You don't care now, but there'll\ncome a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I'm much\nmistaken.\"Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was\nhot; and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,\nthey were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore\nhimself as young gentlemen usually do in such cases. He was moody,\nirritable, and pensive by turns; lost his appetite, neglected his dress,\nand devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano; avoided Jo,\nbut consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragical\nface that haunted her dreams by night, and oppressed her with a heavy\nsense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his\nunrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to\nattempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this was a\nrelief to his friends; but the weeks before his departure were very\nuncomfortable, and every one rejoiced that the \"poor, dear fellow was\ngoing away to forget his trouble, and come home happy.\" Of course, he\nsmiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by, with the sad\nsuperiority of one who knew that his fidelity, like his love, was\nunalterable."

This\ngayety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did,\nfor his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with\na whisper full of motherly solicitude; then, feeling that he was going\nvery fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the\nafflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life. Jo followed a\nminute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. He did look\nround, came back, put his arms about her, as she stood on the step above\nhim, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both\neloquent and pathetic.\"O Jo, can't you?\"[Illustration: O Jo, can't you?]\"Teddy, dear, I wish I could!\"That was all, except a little pause; then Laurie straightened himself\nup, said \"It's all right, never mind,\" and went away without another\nword. Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo _did_ mind; for while the\ncurly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as if\nshe had stabbed her dearest friend; and when he left her without a look\nbehind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.[Illustration: Tail-piece]XXXVI.BETH'S SECRET.When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in\nBeth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too\ngradually to startle those who saw her daily; but to eyes sharpened by\nabsence, it was very plain; and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she\nsaw her sister's face. It was no paler and but little thinner than in\nthe autumn; yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if\nthe mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining\nthrough the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw\nand felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression\nlost much of its power; for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt\nthat she was better; and, presently, in other cares, Jo for a time\nforgot her fear.But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety\nreturned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and been forgiven;\nbut when she showed her savings and proposed the mountain trip, Beth had\nthanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from home.\nAnother little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and, as\ngrandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth\ndown to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open air, and\nlet the fresh sea-breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks."

  "content": "It was not a fashionable place, but, even among the pleasant people\nthere, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.\nBeth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care\nfor any one else; so they were all in all to each other, and came and\nwent, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about\nthem, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble\none, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long\nseparation was not far away.They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it; for often between ourselves\nand those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is\nvery hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart\nand Beth's; but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there seemed\nsomething sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to speak. She\nwondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see\nwhat she saw; and, during the quiet weeks, when the shadow grew so plain\nto her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing that it would\ntell itself when Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if\nher sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing\nthrough her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks,\nwith her head in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her,\nand the sea made music at her feet.[Illustration: With her head in Jo's lap, while the wind blew\n                        healthfully over her]One day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still; and,\nputting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying to\nsee signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks. But she could not\nfind enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands\nseemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been\ngathering. It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was\nslowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened\ntheir hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her\neyes were too dim for seeing, and, when they cleared, Beth was looking\nup at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say,--\"Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it.

Try to see it so, and don't be troubled\nabout me, because it's best; indeed it is.\"\"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth?

I tried to\nthink it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble any one.

It would have been selfish to\nfrighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and\nyou so happy with Laurie,--at least, I thought so then.\"\"And I thought that you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I\ncouldn't,\" cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,\nand added softly,--\"Then you didn't, deary? I was afraid it was so, and imagined your poor\nlittle heart full of love-lornity all that while.\"\"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?\" asked Beth, as\ninnocently as a child. \"I do love him dearly; he is so good to me, how\ncan I help it?

Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave\nher courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death.\nLike a confiding child, she asked no questions, but left everything to\nGod and nature, Father and mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and\nthey only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and\nthe life to come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only\nloved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to\nthe dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned,\nbut through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say, \"I'm\nglad to go,\" for life was very sweet to her; she could only sob out, \"I\ntry to be willing,\" while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave\nof this great sorrow broke over them together.By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity,--\"You'll tell them this when we go home?\"\"I think they will see it without words,\" sighed Jo; for now it seemed\nto her that Beth changed every day."

  "content": "At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice may\nbe seen on the Promenade des Anglais,--a charming place; for the wide\nwalk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is bounded on\none side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined with hotels\nand villas, while beyond lie orange-orchards and the hills. Many nations\nare represented, many languages spoken, many costumes worn; and, on a\nsunny day, the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival. Haughty\nEnglish, lively French, sober Germans, handsome Spaniards, ugly\nRussians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all drive, sit, or saunter\nhere, chatting over the news, and criticising the latest celebrity who\nhas arrived,--Ristori or Dickens, Victor Emmanuel or the Queen of the\nSandwich Islands. The equipages are as varied as the company, and\nattract as much attention, especially the low basket-barouches in which\nladies drive themselves, with a pair of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep\ntheir voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and\nlittle grooms on the perch behind.Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with\nhis hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.\nHe looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the\nindependent air of an American,--a combination which caused sundry pairs\nof feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in\nblack velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and\norange-flowers in their button-holes, to shrug their shoulders, and then\nenvy him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but\nthe young man took little notice of them, except to glance, now and\nthen, at some blonde girl, or lady in blue. Presently he strolled out of\nthe promenade, and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided\nwhether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to\nwander along the beach toward Castle Hill. The quick trot of ponies'\nfeet made him look up, as one of the little carriages, containing a\nsingle lady, came rapidly down the street. The lady was young, blonde,\nand dressed in blue. He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up,\nand, waving his hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.\"O Laurie, is it really you? I thought you'd never come!\" cried Amy,\ndropping the reins, and holding out both hands, to the great\nscandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's steps,\nlest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these\n\"mad English.\"\"I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you,\nand here I am.\"\"How is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you staying?\"\"Very well--last night--at the Chauvain. I called at your hotel, but you\nwere all out.\"\"I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin! Get in, and we can\ntalk at our ease; I was going for a drive, and longing for company.\nFlo's saving up for to-night.\"\"What happens then, a ball?\""

  "content": "\"A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there, and\nthey give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, of course? Aunt\nwill be charmed.\"\"Thank you. Where now?\" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his arms,\na proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive; for her\nparasol-whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs, afforded her\ninfinite satisfaction.\"I'm going to the banker's first, for letters, and then to Castle Hill;\nthe view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever\nbeen there?\"\"Often, years ago; but I don't mind having a look at it.\"\"Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your\ngrandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.\"\"Yes, I spent a month there, and then joined him in Paris, where he has\nsettled for the winter. He has friends there, and finds plenty to amuse\nhim; so I go and come, and we get on capitally.\"\"That's a sociable arrangement,\" said Amy, missing something in Laurie's\nmanner, though she couldn't tell what.\"Why, you see he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still; so we each\nsuit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with him, and he\nenjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that some one is glad to see\nme when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn't it?\" he\nadded, with a look of disgust, as they drove along the boulevard to the\nPlace Napoleon, in the old city.\"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the hills are\ndelicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross-streets are my\ndelight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass; it's\ngoing to the Church of St. John.\""

  "content": "While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their\ncanopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some brotherhood\nin blue, chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt a new sort\nof shyness steal over her; for he was changed, and she could not find\nthe merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside her. He was\nhandsomer than ever, and greatly improved, she thought; but now that the\nflush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired and\nspiritless,--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a\nyear or two of prosperous life should have made him. She couldn't\nunderstand it, and did not venture to ask questions; so she shook her\nhead, and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the\narches of the Paglioni bridge, and vanished in the church.\"_Que pensez vous_?\" she said, airing her French, which had improved in\nquantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.\"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is\ncharming,\" replied Laurie, bowing, with his hand on his heart, and an\nadmiring look.She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy\nher like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he\npromenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was\n\"altogether jolly,\" with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the\nhead. She didn't like the new tone; for, though not _blas√©_, it sounded\nindifferent in spite of the look.\"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy,\" she\nthought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying\nmeantime to seem quite easy and gay.At Avigdor's she found the precious home-letters, and, giving the reins\nto Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between\ngreen hedges, where tea-roses bloomed as freshly as in June.\"Beth is very poorly, mother says. I often think I ought to go home, but\nthey all say 'stay;' so I do, for I shall never have another chance like\nthis,\" said Amy, looking sober over one page.\"I think you are right, there; you could do nothing at home, and it is a\ngreat comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and enjoying\nso much, my dear.\"He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self, as he said\nthat; and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened,\nfor the look, the act, the brotherly \"my dear,\" seemed to assure her\nthat if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.\nPresently she laughed, and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her\nscribbling-suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing\nfrom her mouth the words, \"Genius burns!\"Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest-pocket, \"to keep it from\nblowing away,\" and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read\nhim."

  "content": "\"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the\nmorning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,\" said\nAmy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of\nsplendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.\nWhile Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs\nto the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,\nwith a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had\nwrought. He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and\napprove; for, overlooking a few little affectations of speech and\nmanner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of\nthat indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call\nelegance. Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain _aplomb_\nin both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman\nof the world than she was; but her old petulance now and then showed\nitself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was\nunspoiled by foreign polish.Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks, but\nhe saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a pretty\nlittle picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, which\nbrought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her cheeks,\nthe golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure in the\npleasant scene.As they came up on to the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved\nher hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing\nhere and there,--\"Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the fishermen dragging\ntheir nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert's\nTower, just below, and, best of all, that speck far out to sea which\nthey say is Corsica?\"\"I remember; it's not much changed,\" he answered, without enthusiasm.\"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!\" said Amy, feeling\nin good spirits, and anxious to see him so also.\"Yes,\" was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the\nisland which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting\nin his sight.\"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what you\nhave been doing with yourself all this while,\" said Amy, seating\nherself, ready for a good talk.But she did not get it; for, though he joined her, and answered all her\nquestions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the\ncontinent and been to Greece. So, after idling away an hour, they drove\nhome again; and, having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left\nthem, promising to return in the evening."

  "content": "It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately \"prinked\" that night.\nTime and absence had done its work on both the young people; she had\nseen her old friend in a new light, not as \"our boy,\" but as a handsome\nand agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to\nfind favor in his sight. Amy knew her good points, and made the most of\nthem, with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty\nwoman.Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them\non such occasions, and, following the sensible English fashion of simple\ndress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh\nflowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were\nboth inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist\nsometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique\n_coiffures_, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear\nheart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon\nsuch in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep\nour hearts merry with their artless vanities.\"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,\" said Amy\nto herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball-dress, and covered\nit with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white shoulders and\ngolden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair she had the\nsense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a\nHebe-like knot at the back of her head.\"It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a\nfright of myself,\" she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or\nbraid, as the latest style commanded.Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped\nher fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white\nshoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted boots, she\nsurveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and\n_chass√©ed_ down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.\"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the\nreal lace on aunt's _mouchoir_ gives an air to my whole dress. If I only\nhad a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,\" she said,\nsurveying herself with a critical eye, and a candle in each hand."

  "content": "In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as\nshe glided away; she seldom ran,--it did not suit her style, she\nthought, for, being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate\nthan the sportive or piquante. She walked up and down the long saloon\nwhile waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the\nchandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair; then she thought\nbetter of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed\nof the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so\nhappened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came in\nso quietly she did not hear him; and, as she stood at the distant\nwindow, with her head half turned, and one hand gathering up her dress,\nthe slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a\nwell-placed statue.\"Good evening, Diana!\" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she\nliked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.\"Good evening, Apollo!\" she answered, smiling back at him, for he, too,\nlooked unusually _debonnaire_, and the thought of entering the ball-room\non the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain\nMisses Davis from the bottom of her heart.\"Here are your flowers; I arranged them myself, remembering that you\ndidn't like what Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay,'\" said Laurie, handing her\na delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily\npassed it in Cardiglia's window.[Illustration: Here are your flowers]\"How kind you are!\" she exclaimed gratefully. \"If I'd known you were\ncoming I'd have had something ready for you to-day, though not as pretty\nas this, I'm afraid.\"\"Thank you; it isn't what it should be, but you have improved it,\" he\nadded, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.\"Please don't.\"\"I thought you liked that sort of thing?\"\"Not from you; it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old bluntness\nbetter.\"\"I'm glad of it,\" he answered, with a look of relief; then buttoned her\ngloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to do\nwhen they went to parties together, at home.The company assembled in the long _salle √† manger_, that evening, was\nsuch as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable Americans\nhad invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and, having no\nprejudice against titles, secured a few to add lustre to their Christmas\nball."

  "content": "A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour, and talk\nwith a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother, in black velvet, with\na pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted\nhimself to the ladies, who pronounced him \"a fascinating dear,\" and a\nGerman Serene Something, having come for the supper alone, roamed\nvaguely about, seeking what he might devour. Baron Rothschild's private\nsecretary, a large-nosed Jew, in tight boots, affably beamed upon the\nworld, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo; a stout\nFrenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,\nand Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little\nfamily of eight. Of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced\nAmerican girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto, and a few\nplain but piquante French demoiselles; likewise the usual set of\ntravelling young gentlemen, who disported themselves gayly, while mammas\nof all nations lined the walls, and smiled upon them benignly when they\ndanced with their daughters.Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she \"took the stage\"\nthat night, leaning on Laurie's arm. She knew she looked well, she loved\nto dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ball-room,\nand enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls\nfirst discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by\nvirtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. She did pity the Davis girls,\nwho were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim papa and\nthree grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her friendliest\nmanner as she passed; which was good of her, as it permitted them to see\nher dress, and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking\nfriend might be. With the first burst of the band, Amy's color rose, her\neyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the floor impatiently; for\nshe danced well, and wanted Laurie to know it: therefore the shock she\nreceived can better be imagined than described, when he said, in a\nperfectly tranquil tone,--\"Do you care to dance?\"\"One usually does at a ball.\"Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as\nfast as possible.\"I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?\"\"I can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances divinely; but he\nwill excuse me, as you are an old friend,\" said Amy, hoping that the\nname would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be\ntrifled with.\"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support\"'A daughter of the gods,\n          Divinely tall, and most divinely fair,'\"was all the satisfaction she got, however."

  "content": "The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy\nwas compelled to walk decorously through a cotillon, feeling all the\nwhile as if she could dance the Tarantula with a relish. Laurie resigned\nher to the \"nice little boy,\" and went to do his duty to Flo, without\nsecuring Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of\nforethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself\ntill supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs of penitence.\nShe showed him her ball-book with demure satisfaction when he strolled,\ninstead of rushing, up to claim her for the next, a glorious\npolka-redowa; but his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when\nshe gallopaded away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt\nwith an actual expression of relief.That was unpardonable; and Amy took no more notice of him for a long\nwhile, except a word now and then, when she came to her chaperon,\nbetween the dances, for a necessary pin or a moment's rest. Her anger\nhad a good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and\nseemed unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie's eyes followed her with\npleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit\nand grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. He very\nnaturally fell to studying her from this new point of view; and, before\nthe evening was half over, had decided that \"little Amy was going to\nmake a very charming woman.\"It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took\npossession of every one, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,\nhearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, and banged\nas if they enjoyed it; everybody danced who could, and those who\ncouldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. The air was dark\nwith Davises, and many Joneses gambolled like a flock of young giraffes.\nThe golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor, with a\ndashing Frenchwoman, who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train.\nThe Serene Teuton found the supper-table, and was happy, eating steadily\nthrough the bill of fare, and dismayed the _gar√ßons_ by the ravages he\ncommitted. But the Emperor's friend covered himself with glory, for he\ndanced everything, whether he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu\npirouettes when the figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon of that\nstout man was charming to behold; for, though he \"carried weight,\" he\ndanced like an india-rubber ball. He ran, he flew, he pranced; his face\nglowed, his bald head shone; his coat-tails waved wildly, his pumps\nactually twinkled in the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the\ndrops from his brow, and beamed upon his fellow-men like a French\nPickwick without glasses."
