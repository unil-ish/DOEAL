Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?\" said Meg, bent on making him say\nwhether he thought her improved or not.\"Yes, I think she would,\" returned Laurie gravely.\"Don't you like me so?\" asked Meg.\"No, I don't,\" was the blunt reply.\"Why not?\" in an anxious tone.He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically\ntrimmed dress, with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,\nwhich had not a particle of his usual politeness about it.\"I don't like fuss and feathers.\"That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself; and Meg\nwalked away, saying petulantly,--\"You are the rudest boy I ever saw.\"Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window, to cool\nher cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant\ncolor. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by; and, a minute after,\nshe heard him saying to his mother,--\"They are making a fool of that little girl; I wanted you to see her,\nbut they have spoilt her entirely; she's nothing but a doll, to-night.\"\"Oh, dear!\" sighed Meg; \"I wish I'd been sensible, and worn my own\nthings; then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so\nuncomfortable and ashamed myself.\"She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the\ncurtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one\ntouched her; and, turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said,\nwith his very best bow, and his hand out,--\"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.\"\"I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,\" said Meg, trying to\nlook offended, and failing entirely.\"Not a bit of it; I'm dying to do it. Come, I'll be good; I don't like\nyour gown, but I do think you are--just splendid;\" and he waved his\nhands, as if words failed to express his admiration.Meg smiled and relented, and whispered, as they stood waiting to catch\nthe time,--\"Take care my skirt don't trip you up; it's the plague of my life, and I\nwas a goose to wear it.\""

They won't\nunderstand the joke, and it will worry mother.\"\"Then why did you do it?\" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg\nhastily added,--\"I shall tell them, myself, all about it, and ''fess' to mother how\nsilly I've been. But I'd rather do it myself; so you'll not tell, will\nyou?\"\"I give you my word I won't; only what shall I say when they ask me?\"\"Just say I looked pretty well, and was having a good time.\"\"I'll say the first, with all my heart; but how about the other? You\ndon't look as if you were having a good time; are you?\" and Laurie\nlooked at her with an expression which made her answer, in a whisper,--\"No; not just now. Don't think I'm horrid; I only wanted a little fun,\nbut this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it.\"\"Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want?\" said Laurie, knitting his\nblack brows, as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a\npleasant addition to the party.\"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for\nthem. What a bore!\" said Meg, assuming a languid air, which amused\nLaurie immensely.He did not speak to her again till supper-time, when he saw her drinking\nchampagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving \"like a pair\nof fools,\" as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of\nright to watch over the Marches, and fight their battles whenever a\ndefender was needed.[Illustration: I wouldn't, Meg]"

To-morrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers,' and be\ndesperately good again,\" she answered, with an affected little laugh.\"Wish to-morrow was here, then,\" muttered Laurie, walking off,\nill-pleased at the change he saw in her.Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did;\nafter supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly\nupsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that\nscandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no\nchance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say\ngood-night.\"Remember!\" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had\nalready begun.\"Silence Ã  la mort,\" replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as he\nwent away.This little bit of by-play excited Annie's curiosity; but Meg was too\ntired for gossip, and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a\nmasquerade, and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was\nsick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her\nfortnight's fun, and feeling that she had \"sat in the lap of luxury\"\nlong enough.\"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all\nthe time. Home _is_ a nice place, though it isn't splendid,\" said Meg,\nlooking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother\nand Jo on the Sunday evening.\"I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem\ndull and poor to you, after your fine quarters,\" replied her mother, who\nhad given her many anxious looks that day; for motherly eyes are quick\nto see any change in children's faces."

As\nthe clock struck nine, and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her chair,\nand, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee, saying\nbravely,--\"Marmee, I want to ''fess.'\"\"I thought so; what is it, dear?\"\"Shall I go away?\" asked Jo discreetly.\"Of course not; don't I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to\nspeak of it before the children, but I want you to know all the dreadful\nthings I did at the Moffat's.\"\"We are prepared,\" said Mrs. March, smiling, but looking a little\nanxious.\"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they powdered\nand squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie\nthought I wasn't proper; I know he did, though he didn't say so, and one\nman called me 'a doll.' I knew it was silly, but they flattered me, and\nsaid I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a\nfool of me.\"\"Is that all?\" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast\nface of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame\nher little follies.\"No; I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether\nabominable,\" said Meg self-reproachfully.\"There is something more, I think;\" and Mrs. March smoothed the soft\ncheek, which suddenly grew rosy, as Meg answered slowly,--\"Yes; it's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have\npeople say and think such things about us and Laurie.\"Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats;\nand, as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill\npleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.\"Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard,\" cried Jo\nindignantly. \"Why didn't you pop out and tell them so, on the spot?\"\"I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help hearing, at\nfirst, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I\nought to go away.\""

The idea of having 'plans,' and being kind to\nLaurie, because he's rich, and may marry us by and by! Won't he shout,\nwhen I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?\" and\nJo laughed, as if, on second thoughts, the thing struck her as a good\njoke.\"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She mustn't, must she,\nmother?\" said Meg, looking distressed.\"No; never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you\ncan,\" said Mrs. March gravely. \"I was very unwise to let you go among\npeople of whom I know so little,--kind, I dare say, but worldly,\nill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more\nsorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,\nMeg.\"\"Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me; I'll forget all the bad, and\nremember only the good; for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very\nmuch for letting me go. I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, mother;\nI know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till I'm fit to\ntake care of myself. But it _is_ nice to be praised and admired, and I\ncan't help saying I like it,\" said Meg, looking half ashamed of the\nconfession.\"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not\nbecome a passion, and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn\nto know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the\nadmiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg.\"Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind\nher, looking both interested and a little perplexed; for it was a new\nthing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and\nthings of that sort; and Jo felt as if, during that fortnight, her\nsister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a\nworld where she could not follow.\"Mother, do you have 'plans,' as Mrs. Moffat said?\" asked Meg bashfully."

I will tell you some of them,\nfor the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and\nheart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but\nnot too young to understand me; and mothers' lips are the fittest to\nspeak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in time,\nperhaps, so listen to my 'plans,' and help me carry them out, if they\nare good.\"Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they\nwere about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,\nand watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her\nserious yet cheery way,--[Illustration: Holding a hand of each, Mrs. March said, &c.]\"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be\nadmired, loved, and respected; to have a happy youth, to be well and\nwisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care\nand sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen\nby a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a\nwoman; and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience.\nIt is natural to think of it, Meg; right to hope and wait for it, and\nwise to prepare for it; so that, when the happy time comes, you may\nfeel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear girls, I _am_\nambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the world,--marry\nrich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid houses, which\nare not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious\nthing,--and, when well used, a noble thing,--but I never want you to\nthink it is the first or only prize to strive for. I'd rather see you\npoor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on\nthrones, without self-respect and peace.\"\"Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put\nthemselves forward,\" sighed Meg.\"Then we'll be old maids,\" said Jo stoutly."

Some of\nthe best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so\nlove-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these\nthings to time; make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes\nof your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are\nnot. One thing remember, my girls: mother is always ready to be your\nconfidant, father to be your friend; and both of us trust and hope that\nour daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort\nof our lives.\"\"We will, Marmee, we will!\" cried both, with all their hearts, as she\nbade them good-night.X.THE P. C. AND P. O.As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the\nlengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.\nThe garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the\nlittle plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, \"I'd know\nwhich each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny;\" and so\nshe might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.\nMeg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange-tree in it.\nJo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying\nexperiments; this year it was to be a plantation of sun-flowers, the\nseeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed \"Aunt\nCockle-top\" and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned, fragrant\nflowers in her garden,--sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,\npansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the bird, and catnip for\nthe pussies. Amy had a bower in hers,--rather small and earwiggy, but\nvery pretty to look at,--with honeysuckles and morning-glories hanging\ntheir colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it; tall,\nwhite lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants\nas would consent to blossom there."

One of these was the \"P. C.\"; for, as\nsecret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one;\nand, as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the\nPickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a\nyear, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which\noccasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in\na row before a table, on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with\na big \"P. C.\" in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper,\ncalled \"The Pickwick Portfolio,\" to which all contributed something;\nwhile Jo, who revelled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven\no'clock, the four members ascended to the club-room, tied their badges\nround their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as\nthe eldest, was Samuel Pickwick; Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus\nSnodgrass; Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,\nwho was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.\nPickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original\ntales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which\nthey good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and\nshort-comings.[Illustration: Mr. Pickwick]On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any\nglasses, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and, having stared hard at Mr.\nSnodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself\nproperly, began to read:--The Pickwick Portfolio.MAY 20, 18--Poet's Corner.ANNIVERSARY ODE.Again we meet to celebrate\n          With badge and solemn rite,\n        Our fifty-second anniversary,\n          In Pickwick Hall, to-night.We all are here in perfect health,\n          None gone from our small band;\n        Again we see each well-known face,\n          And press each friendly hand.Our Pickwick, always at his post,\n          With reverence we greet,\n        As, spectacles on nose, he reads\n          Our well-filled weekly sheet.Although he suffers from a cold,\n          We joy to hear him speak,\n        For words of wisdom from him fall,\n          In spite of croak or squeak.Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,\n          With elephantine grace,\n        And beams upon the company,\n          With brown and jovial face.Poetic fire lights up his eye,\n          He struggles 'gainst his lot.\n        Behold ambition on his brow,\n          And on his nose a blot!Next our peaceful Tupman comes,\n          So rosy, plump, and sweet.\n        Who chokes with laughter at the puns,\n          And tumbles off his seat.Prim little Winkle too is here,\n          With every hair in place,\n        A model of propriety,\n          Though he hates to wash his face.The year is gone, we still unite\n          To joke and laugh and read,\n        And tread the path of literature\n          That doth to glory lead.Long may our paper prosper well,\n          Our club unbroken be,\n        And coming years their blessings pour\n          On the useful, gay \"P.

Her dress is well\n    chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she\n    passionately hates.\"\"By my faith, I envy him.

Instant silence fell upon the gay\n    throng; and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle\n    of orange-groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as\n    Count de Adelon spoke thus:--\"My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered\n    you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait\n    your services.\"All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a low murmur of\n    amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom\n    removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts,\n    but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over.\n    Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding an\n    explanation.\"Gladly would I give it if I could; but I only know that it was\n    the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it.

He likes to write, and\nhe'll give a tone to our contributions, and keep us from being\nsentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for him, and he does so\nmuch for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place here,\nand make him welcome if he comes.\"This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet,\nlooking as if he had quite made up his mind.\"Yes, we ought to do it, even if we _are_ afraid. I say he _may_ come,\nand his grandpa, too, if he likes.\"This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her\nseat to shake hands approvingly. \"Now then, vote again. Everybody\nremember it's our Laurie, and say 'Ay!'\" cried Snodgrass excitedly.\"Ay! ay! ay!\" replied three voices at once.\"Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like 'taking time by the\n_fetlock_,' as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present\nthe new member;\" and, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw\nopen the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag-bag,\nflushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.[Illustration: Jo threw open the door of the closet]\"You rogue! you traitor! Jo, how could you?\" cried the three girls, as\nSnodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth; and, producing both a chair\nand a badge, installed him in a jiffy.\"The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,\" began Mr. Pickwick, trying\nto get up an awful frown, and only succeeding in producing an amiable\nsmile. But the new member was equal to the occasion; and, rising, with a\ngrateful salutation to the Chair, said, in the most engaging manner,\n\"Mr. President and ladies,--I beg pardon, gentlemen,--allow me to\nintroduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble servant of the club.\"\"Good! good!\" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming-pan\non which she leaned.\"My faithful friend and noble patron,\" continued Laurie, with a wave of\nthe hand, \"who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for\nthe base stratagem of to-night. I planned it, and she only gave in after\nlots of teasing.\"\"Come now, don't lay it all on yourself; you know I proposed the\ncupboard,\" broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly."

I'm the wretch that did it, sir,\" said\nthe new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. \"But on my\nhonor, I never will do so again, and henceforth _dewote_ myself to the\ninterest of this immortal club.\"\"Hear! hear!\" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming-pan like a\ncymbal.\"Go on, go on!\" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed\nbenignly.\"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the\nhonor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between\nadjoining nations, I have set up a post-office in the hedge in the lower\ncorner of the garden; a fine, spacious building, with padlocks on the\ndoors, and every convenience for the mails,--also the females, if I may\nbe allowed the expression. It's the old martin-house; but I've stopped\nup the door, and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts of\nthings, and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and\nbundles can be passed in there; and, as each nation has a key, it will\nbe uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key; and,\nwith many thanks for your favor, take my seat.\"Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table, and\nsubsided; the warming-pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time\nbefore order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and every\none came out surprising, for every one did her best; so it was an\nunusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it\nbroke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,\nwell-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did add\n\"spirit\" to the meetings, and \"a tone\" to the paper; for his orations\nconvulsed his hearers, and his contributions were excellent, being\npatriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental. Jo\nregarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or Shakespeare; and remodelled\nher own works with good effect, she thought."

The Kings are off to the seashore to-morrow, and I'm\nfree. Three months' vacation,--how I shall enjoy it!\" exclaimed Meg,\ncoming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual\nstate of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and Amy made\nlemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.\"Aunt March went to-day, for which, oh, be joyful!\" said Jo. \"I was\nmortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her; if she had, I should have\nfelt as if I ought to do it; but Plumfield is about as gay as a\nchurchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry getting\nthe old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I\nwas in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and\nsweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me. I quaked\ntill she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for, as it\ndrove off, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josy-phine, won't you--?'\nI didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled; I did actually\nrun, and whisked round the corner, where I felt safe.\"\"Poor old Jo! she came in looking as if bears were after her,\" said\nBeth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.\"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?\" observed Amy, tasting\nher mixture critically.\"She means _vampire_, not sea-weed; but it doesn't matter; it's too warm\nto be particular about one's parts of speech,\" murmured Jo.\"What shall you do all your vacation?\" asked Amy, changing the subject,\nwith tact.\"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,\" replied Meg, from the depths of\nthe rocking-chair. \"I've been routed up early all winter, and had to\nspend my days working for other people; so now I'm going to rest and\nrevel to my heart's content.\""

I want to learn some new songs,\nand my children need fitting up for the summer; they are dreadfully out\nof order, and really suffering for clothes.\"\"May we, mother?\" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing, in\nwhat they called \"Marmee's corner.\"\"You may try your experiment for a week, and see how you like it. I\nthink by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as\nbad as all work and no play.\"\"Oh, dear, no! it will be delicious, I'm sure,\" said Meg complacently.\"I now propose a toast, as my 'friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp,' says.\nFun forever, and no grubbing!\" cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the\nlemonade went round."

Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock; her\nsolitary breakfast did not taste nice, and the room seemed lonely and\nuntidy; for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's\nbooks lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but \"Marmee's\ncorner,\" which looked as usual; and there Meg sat, to \"rest and read,\"\nwhich meant yawn, and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get\nwith her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river, with Laurie, and the\nafternoon reading and crying over \"The Wide, Wide World,\" up in the\napple-tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet,\nwhere her family resided; but, getting tired before half done, she left\nher establishment topsy-turvy, and went to her music, rejoicing that she\nhad no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white\nfrock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw, under the honeysuckles,\nhoping some one would see and inquire who the young artist was.

Meg, who went shopping in the\nafternoon, and got a \"sweet blue muslin,\" had discovered, after she had\ncut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her\nslightly cross. Jo had burnt the skin off her nose boating, and got a\nraging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion\nof her closet, and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at\nonce; and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy\nBrown's party was to be the next day; and now, like Flora McFlimsey, she\nhad \"nothing to wear.\" But these were mere trifles; and they assured\ntheir mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said\nnothing, and, with Hannah's help, did their neglected work, keeping home\npleasant, and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was\nastonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was\nproduced by the \"resting and revelling\" process. The days kept getting\nlonger and longer; the weather was unusually variable, and so were\ntempers; an unsettled feeling possessed every one, and Satan found\nplenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury,\nMeg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily that\nshe fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes, in her attempts to\nfurbish them up Ã  la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out, and she was\nsick of books; got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a\nquarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished\nshe had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was\nconstantly forgetting that it was to be _all play, and no work_, and\nfell back into her old ways now and then; but something in the air\naffected her, and, more than once, her tranquillity was much disturbed;\nso much so, that, on one occasion, she actually shook poor dear Joanna,\nand told her she was \"a fright.\" Amy fared worst of all, for her\nresources were small; and when her sisters left her to amuse and care\nfor herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self\na great burden. She didn't like dolls, fairy-tales were childish, and\none couldn't draw all the time; tea-parties didn't amount to much,\nneither did picnics, unless very well conducted. \"If one could have a\nfine house, full of nice girls, or go travelling, the summer would be\ndelightful; but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a\ngrown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz,\" complained Miss\nMalaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and _ennui_."

Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who\nhad a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an\nappropriate manner; so she gave Hannah a holiday, and let the girls\nenjoy the full effect of the play system.When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,\nno breakfast in the dining-room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.\"Mercy on us! what _has_ happened?\" cried Jo, staring about her in\ndismay.Meg ran upstairs, and soon came back again, looking relieved, but rather\nbewildered, and a little ashamed.\"Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay\nquietly in her room all day, and let us do the best we can. It's a very\nqueer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself; but she\nsays it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble, but take\ncare of ourselves.\"\"That's easy enough, and I like the idea; I'm aching for something to\ndo--that is, some new amusement, you know,\" added Jo quickly.In fact it _was_ an immense relief to them all to have a little work,\nand they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's\nsaying, \"Housekeeping ain't no joke.\" There was plenty of food in the\nlarder, and, while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,\nwondering, as they did so, why servants ever talked about hard work.\"I shall take some up to mother, though she said we were not to think of\nher, for she'd take care of herself,\" said Meg, who presided, and felt\nquite matronly behind the teapot.So a tray was fitted out before any one began, and taken up, with the\ncook's compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelette\nscorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus; but Mrs. March\nreceived her repast with thanks, and laughed heartily over it after Jo\nwas gone."

Jo, with\nperfect faith in her own powers, and a friendly desire to make up the\nquarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to\ndinner.\"You'd better see what you have got before you think of having company,\"\nsaid Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.\"Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes; and I shall get some\nasparagus, and a lobster, 'for a relish,' as Hannah says. We'll have\nlettuce, and make a salad. I don't know how, but the book tells. I'll\nhave blanc-mange and strawberries for dessert; and coffee, too, if you\nwant to be elegant.\"\"Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but\ngingerbread and molasses candy, fit to eat. I wash my hands of the\ndinner-party; and, since you have asked Laurie on your own\nresponsibility, you may just take care of him.\"\"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him, and help to the\npudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?\"\nasked Jo, rather hurt.\"Yes; but I don't know much, except about bread, and a few trifles. You\nhad better ask mother's leave before you order anything,\" returned Meg\nprudently.\"Of course I shall; I'm not a fool,\" and Jo went off in a huff at the\ndoubts expressed of her powers.\"Get what you like, and don't disturb me; I'm going out to dinner, and\ncan't worry about things at home,\" said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to\nher. \"I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation\nto-day, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.\""
