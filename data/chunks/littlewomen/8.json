  "content": "She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned\nspoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses, till they shone. Then\nshe must dust the room, and what a trying job that was! Not a speck\nescaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs, and much\ncarving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly must be fed, the\nlap-dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down, to get things, or\ndeliver orders, for the old lady was very lame, and seldom left her big\nchair. After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a\ndaily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour\nfor exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it? Laurie came every day,\nand wheedled Aunt March, till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when\nthey walked and rode, and had capital times. After dinner, she had to\nread aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually\ndid for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork\nor towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward\nrebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked\ntill tea-time. The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell\nto telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull\nthat Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard\nfate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a\ntear or two.If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that\nshe never could have got through that dreadful time. The parrot alone\nwas enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not\nadmire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. He\npulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to\nplague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking\nat him while Madam dozed; called her names before company, and behaved\nin all respects like a reprehensible old bird. Then she could not endure\nthe dog,--a fat, cross beast, who snarled and yelped at her when she\nmade his toilet, and who lay on his back, with all his legs in the air\nand a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to\neat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was bad-tempered, the\nold coachman deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of\nthe young lady.[Illustration: On his back, with all his legs in the air]"

  "content": "Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with \"Madame,\" as she called her\nmistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,\nwho could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but\nAunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that\nshe was never asked to change her religion. She took a fancy to\nMademoiselle, and amused her very much, with odd stories of her life in\nFrance, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces. She also\nallowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and\npretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests;\nfor Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy's chief delight was an Indian\ncabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeon-holes, and secret places,\nin which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely\ncurious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things\ngave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel-cases, in which, on\nvelvet cushions, reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty\nyears ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came\nout, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding-day, her lover's\ndiamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with\nportraits of dead friends, and weeping willows made of hair inside; the\nbaby bracelets her one little daughter had worn; Uncle March's big\nwatch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in\na box, all by itself, lay Aunt March's wedding-ring, too small now for\nher fat finger, but put carefully away, like the most precious jewel of\nthem all.[Illustration: I should choose this]\"Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?\" asked Esther, who\nalways sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.\"I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm\nfond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose this if I\nmight,\" replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold\nand ebony beads, from which hung a heavy cross of the same.\"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace; ah, no! to me it is a\nrosary, and as such I should use it like a good Catholic,\" said Esther,\neying the handsome thing wistfully.\"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads\nhanging over your glass?\" asked Amy.\"Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one\nused so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.\"\"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and\nalways come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could.\"\"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort; but, as\nthat is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day, to\nmeditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame.\nShe had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble.\"\"Would it be right for me to do so too?\" asked Amy, who, in her\nloneliness, felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was\napt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind her\nof it.\"It would be excellent and charming; and I shall gladly arrange the\nlittle dressing-room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame, but\nwhen she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and\npray the dear God to preserve your sister.\"Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice; for she had an\naffectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. Amy\nliked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her\nroom, hoping it would do her good."

  "content": "\"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March\ndies,\" she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary, and shut the\njewel-cases one by one.\"To you and your sisters. I know it; Madame confides in me; I witnessed\nher will, and it is to be so,\" whispered Esther, smiling.\"How nice! but I wish she'd let us have them now. Pro-cras-ti-nation is\nnot agreeable,\" observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.\"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first\none who is affianced will have the pearls--Madame has said it; and I\nhave a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when\nyou go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners.\"\"Do you think so? Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely\nring! It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's. I do like Aunt\nMarch, after all;\" and Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face,\nand a firm resolve to earn it.From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady\ncomplacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up the\ncloset with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a\npicture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no\ngreat value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that\nMadame would never know it, nor care if she did. It was, however, a very\nvaluable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy's\nbeauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of\nthe divine mother, while tender thoughts of her own were busy at her\nheart. On the table she laid her little Testament and hymn-book, kept a\nvase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every\nday to \"sit alone, thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to\npreserve her sister.\" Esther had given her a rosary of black beads, with\na silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful\nas to its fitness for Protestant prayers."

  "content": "The little girl was very sincere in all this, for, being left alone\noutside the safe home-nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold\nby so sorely, that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender\nFriend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children.\nShe missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having\nbeen taught where to look, she did her best to find the way, and walk in\nit confidingly. But Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden\nseemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be\nsatisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In\nher first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will,\nas Aunt March had done; so that if she _did_ fall ill and die, her\npossessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang\neven to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were\nas precious as the old lady's jewels.During one of her play-hours she wrote out the important document as\nwell as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms,\nand, when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt\nrelieved, and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second\nwitness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in\none of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this\nroom there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes, with which\nEsther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to array\nherself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long\nmirror, making stately courtesies, and sweeping her train about, with a\nrustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she\ndid not hear Laurie's ring, nor see his face peeping in at her, as she\ngravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on\nwhich she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue\nbrocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk\ncarefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo\nafterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay\nsuit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as\nwell as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, \"Ain't\nwe fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha!\nha!\"[Illustration: Gravely promenaded to and fro]Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it\nshould offend her majesty, Laurie tapped, and was graciously received."

  "content": "\"Sit down and rest while I put these things away; then I want to consult\nyou about a very serious matter,\" said Amy, when she had shown her\nsplendor, and driven Polly into a corner. \"That bird is the trial of my\nlife,\" she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while\nLaurie seated himself astride of a chair. \"Yesterday, when aunt was\nasleep, and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to\nsquall and flap about in his cage; so I went to let him out, and found a\nbig spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase; Polly\nmarched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase,\nsaying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, 'Come out and take a\nwalk, my dear.' I _couldn't_ help laughing, which made Poll swear, and\naunt woke up and scolded us both.\"\"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?\" asked Laurie,\nyawning.\"Yes; out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and\nscrambled up on aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! catch her! catch\nher!' as I chased the spider.\"That's a lie! Oh lor!\" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.\"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\" cried Laurie,\nshaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side, and gravely\ncroaked, \"Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\"\"Now I'm ready,\" said Amy, shutting the wardrobe, and taking a paper out\nof her pocket. \"I want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is\nlegal and right. I felt that I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and\nI don't want any ill-feeling over my tomb.\"[Illustration: Amy's Will]Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read\nthe following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the\nspelling:--\"MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT.\"I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, do give and\n    bequeethe all my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely\"To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of\n    art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he likes with.\"To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with\n    pockets,--also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.\"To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get\n    it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of\n    real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of\n    her 'little girl.'\"To Jo I leave my breast-pin, the one mended with sealing wax,\n    also my bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most\n    precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burnt up her\n    story.\"To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little\n    bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can\n    wear them being thin when she gets well.

She felt so ill one day\nthat she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you,\nand the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake.

I forgot it; but I want it done, though it will\nspoil my looks.\"Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he\namused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But\nwhen he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper, with trembling lips,\n\"Is there really any danger about Beth?\"\"I'm afraid there is; but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,\ndear;\" and Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which\nwas very comforting.When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and, sitting in the\ntwilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,\nfeeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the\nloss of her gentle little sister.[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Mrs. March would not leave Beth's side]XX.CONFIDENTIAL.I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the\nmother and daughters; such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to\ndescribe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely\nsaying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg's\ntender hope was realized; for when Beth woke from that long, healing\nsleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell _were_ the little rose\nand mother's face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled, and\nnestled close into the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry\nlonging was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls\nwaited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which\nclung to hers even in sleep. Hannah had \"dished up\" an astonishing\nbreakfast for the traveller, finding it impossible to vent her\nexcitement in any other way; and Meg and Jo fed their mother like\ndutiful young storks, while they listened to her whispered account of\nfather's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays\nwhich the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable\ncomfort Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out\nwith fatigue, anxiety, and cold."

  "content": "What a strange, yet pleasant day that was! so brilliant and gay without,\nfor all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow; so quiet and\nreposeful within, for every one slept, spent with watching, and a\nSabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah\nmounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off,\nMeg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten\nboats, safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave\nBeth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at,\ntouch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered\ntreasure.Laurie, meanwhile, posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well\nthat Aunt March actually \"sniffed\" herself, and never once said, \"I told\nyou so.\" Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good\nthoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her\ntears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never\neven thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in\nLaurie's opinion, that she behaved \"like a capital little woman.\" Even\nPolly seemed impressed, for he called her \"good girl,\" blessed her\nbuttons, and begged her to \"come and take a walk, dear,\" in his most\naffable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright\nwintry weather; but, discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in\nspite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest\non the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time\nabout it; and, when she returned, he was stretched out, with both arms\nunder his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the\ncurtains, and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake till night,\nand I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by\nAmy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good\nmany happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my\nprivate opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her\nmother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation\nin the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone\ntogether in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its\npurpose was explained to her."

Aunt gave me the\nring to-day; she called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my\nfinger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me\nalways.

I'd like to wear them, mother; can I?\"\"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such\nornaments, Amy,\" said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with\nthe band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard,\nformed of two tiny, golden hands clasped together.\"I'll try not to be vain,\" said Amy. \"I don't think I like it only\nbecause it's so pretty; but I want to wear it as the girl in the story\nwore her bracelet, to remind me of something.\"\"Do you mean Aunt March?\" asked her mother, laughing.\"No, to remind me not to be selfish.\" Amy looked so earnest and sincere\nabout it, that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to\nthe little plan."

I see it all! they'll go lovering around\nthe house, and we shall have to dodge; Meg will be absorbed, and no good\nto me any more; Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off,\nand make a hole in the family; and I shall break my heart, and\neverything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! why weren't we\nall boys, then there wouldn't be any bother.\"Jo leaned her chin on her knees, in a disconsolate attitude, and shook\nher fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked up\nwith an air of relief.\"You don't like it, mother? I'm glad of it. Let's send him about his\nbusiness, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as we\nalways have been.\"\"I did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to\nhomes of your own, in time; but I do want to keep my girls as long as I\ncan; and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only\nseventeen, and it will be some years before John can make a home for\nher. Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in\nany way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John love one\nanother, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She is\nconscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly. My\npretty, tender-hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her.\"\"Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?\" asked Jo, as her mother's\nvoice faltered a little over the last words.\"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo; and I hope my girls will never\nfeel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should\nlike to know that John was firmly established in some good business,\nwhich gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make\nMeg comfortable. I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable\nposition, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with\nlove and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your\ngood fortune; but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can\nbe had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and\nsome privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see\nMeg begin humbly, for, if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the\npossession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a fortune.\""

Then he's rich and generous and\ngood, and loves us all; and _I_ say it's a pity my plan is spoilt.\"\"I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown up enough for Meg, and altogether too\nmuch of a weathercock, just now, for any one to depend on. Don't make\nplans, Jo; but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. We can't\nmeddle safely in such matters, and had better not get 'romantic\nrubbish,' as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.\"\"Well, I won't; but I hate to see things going all criss-cross and\ngetting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten\nit out. I wish wearing flat-irons on our heads would keep us from\ngrowing up.

I'm going to bed; come, Peggy,\" said\nJo, unfolding herself, like an animated puzzle.\"Quite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love to\nJohn,\" said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter, and gave it\nback.\"Do you call him 'John'?\" asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes\nlooking down into her mother's.\"Yes; he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,\"\nreplied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.\"I'm glad of that, he is so lonely. Good-night, mother, dear. It is so\ninexpressibly comfortable to have you here,\" was Meg's quiet answer.The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one; and, as she went\naway, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, \"She\ndoes not love John yet, but will soon learn to.\"[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Letters]XXI.LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE."

  "content": "Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,\nand she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. Meg observed\nit, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned\nthat the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt\nsure of being told everything if she did not ask. She was rather\nsurprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed\na patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in her turn\nassumed an air of dignified reserve, and devoted herself to her mother.\nThis left Jo to her own devices; for Mrs. March had taken her place as\nnurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long\nconfinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge; and, much as\nshe enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an\nincorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax her secret from her.She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a\nmystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of\nit. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected\nindifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he\nknew, then that he didn't care; and, at last, by dint of perseverance,\nhe satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling\nindignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his\nwits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter, and was absorbed in\npreparations for her father's return; but all of a sudden a change\nseemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike\nherself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very\nquiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face.\nTo her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and Jo's\nshe silenced by begging to be let alone.\"She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very fast. She's\ngot most of the symptoms,--is twittery and cross, doesn't eat, lies\nawake, and mopes in corners. I caught her singing that song he gave her,\nand once she said 'John,' as you do, and then turned as red as a poppy.\nWhatever shall we do?\" said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however\nviolent.\"Nothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and father's\ncoming will settle everything,\" replied her mother.\"Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals\nmine,\" said Jo, next day, as she distributed the contents of the little\npost-office.Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg\nmade them look up to see her staring at her note, with a frightened\nface.\"My child, what is it?\" cried her mother, running to her, while Jo tried\nto take the paper which had done the mischief."

What's she talking about?\" cried Jo, bewildered.Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from\nher pocket, and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully,--\"You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, so\nmean, and cruel to us both?\"Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note, which\nwas written in a peculiar hand.[Illustration: Jo and her mother were reading the note]\"MY DEAREST MARGARET,--\"I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate\n    before I return. I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think\n    they would consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr.\n    Laurence will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet\n    girl, you will make me happy. I implore you to say nothing to\n    your family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to\n                                            \"Your devoted JOHN.\"\"Oh, the little villain! that's the way he meant to pay me for keeping\nmy word to mother. I'll give him a hearty scolding, and bring him over\nto beg pardon,\" cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice. But her\nmother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore,--\"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so many\npranks, that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.\"\"On my word, mother, I haven't! I never saw that note before, and don't\nknow anything about it, as true as I live!\" said Jo, so earnestly that\nthey believed her. \"If I _had_ taken a part in it I'd have done it\nbetter than this, and have written a sensible note. I should think you'd\nhave known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that,\" she added,\nscornfully tossing down the paper.\"It's like his writing,\" faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in her\nhand.\"O Meg, you didn't answer it?\" cried Mrs. March quickly.\"Yes, I did!\" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame."

Margaret,\ntell me the whole story,\" commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet\nkeeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.\"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew\nanything about it,\" began Meg, without looking up. \"I was worried at\nfirst, and meant to tell you; then I remembered how you liked Mr.\nBrooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a\nfew days. I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew; and, while I\nwas deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such\nthings to do. Forgive me, mother, I'm paid for my silliness now; I never\ncan look him in the face again.\"\"What did you say to him?\" asked Mrs. March.\"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet; that I didn't\nwish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father. I was very\ngrateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more,\nfor a long while.\"Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,\nexclaiming, with a laugh,--\"You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence!\nTell on, Meg. What did he say to that?\"\"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent\nany love-letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,\nshould take such liberties with our names. It's very kind and\nrespectful, but think how dreadful for me!\"Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo\ntramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden she\nstopped, caught up the two notes, and, after looking at them closely,\nsaid decidedly, \"I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these\nletters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with, because\nI wouldn't tell him my secret.\"\"Don't have any secrets, Jo; tell it to mother, and keep out of trouble,\nas I should have done,\" said Meg warningly.\"Bless you, child!

Do you love him enough to wait till he\ncan make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the\npresent?\"\"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do\nwith lovers for a long while,--perhaps never,\" answered Meg petulantly.\n\"If John _doesn't_ know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him,\nand make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won't be deceived and\nplagued and made a fool of,--it's a shame!\"Seeing that Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by\nthis mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire\nsilence, and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie's step\nwas heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received\nthe culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he\nwouldn't come; but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and\nstood twirling his hat, with a guilty air which convicted him at once.\nJo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a\nsentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of\nvoices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour; but what happened\nduring that interview the girls never knew.When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother, with such\na penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it\nwise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, and was much\ncomforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.\"I'll never tell him to my dying day,--wild horses sha'n't drag it out\nof me; so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how\nout-and-out sorry I am,\" he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.\"I'll try; but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do. I didn't think\nyou could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,\" replied Meg, trying to hide\nher maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air."

Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face\nrelaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him\ndeclare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and\nabase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and\nsucceeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire\ndisapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but, as she showed\nno sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till\nthe others were done with him, when he made her a low bow, and walked\noff without a word.As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving; and when\nMeg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely, and longed for Teddy.\nAfter resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and, armed\nwith a book to return, went over to the big house.\"Is Mr. Laurence in?\" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming down\nstairs.\"Yes, miss; but I don't believe he's seeable just yet.\"\"Why not? is he ill?\"\"La, no, miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of\nhis tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I\ndursn't go nigh him.\"\"Where is Laurie?\"\"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been a-tapping. I\ndon't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's ready, and there's\nno one to eat it.\"\"I'll go and see what the matter is. I'm not afraid of either of them.\"Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.\"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!\" called out the young\ngentleman, in a threatening tone.Jo immediately knocked again; the door flew open, and in she bounced,\nbefore Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that he really\n_was_ out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite\nexpression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,\n\"Please forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, and can't\ngo away till I have.\"\"It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo,\" was the cavalier\nreply to her petition.[Illustration: Get up and don't be a goose]\"Thank you; I will. Could I ask what's the matter? You don't look\nexactly easy in your mind.\""

Why were you treated so?\"\"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd\npromised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word.\"\"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?\"\"No; he _would_ have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\ntruth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing\nMeg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the\nold gentleman collared me. Then I got angry, and bolted, for fear I\nshould forget myself.\"\"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know; so go down and make up. I'll\nhelp you.\"\"Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by every\none, just for a bit of a frolic. I _was_ sorry about Meg, and begged\npardon like a man; but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in the wrong.\"\"He didn't know that.\"\"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It's no use, Jo;\nhe's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, and don't need\nany one's apron-string to hold on by.\"\"What pepper-pots you are!\" sighed Jo. \"How do you mean to settle this\naffair?\"\"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't tell\nhim what the fuss's about.\"\"Bless you! he won't do that.\"\"I won't go down till he does.\"\"Now, Teddy, be sensible; let it pass, and I'll explain what I can. You\ncan't stay here, so what's the use of being melodramatic?\"\"I don't intend to stay here long, any way.
