  "content": "The little girl was very sincere in all this, for, being left alone\noutside the safe home-nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold\nby so sorely, that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender\nFriend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children.\nShe missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having\nbeen taught where to look, she did her best to find the way, and walk in\nit confidingly. But Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden\nseemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be\nsatisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In\nher first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will,\nas Aunt March had done; so that if she _did_ fall ill and die, her\npossessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang\neven to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were\nas precious as the old lady's jewels.During one of her play-hours she wrote out the important document as\nwell as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms,\nand, when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt\nrelieved, and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second\nwitness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in\none of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this\nroom there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes, with which\nEsther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to array\nherself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long\nmirror, making stately courtesies, and sweeping her train about, with a\nrustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she\ndid not hear Laurie's ring, nor see his face peeping in at her, as she\ngravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on\nwhich she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue\nbrocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk\ncarefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo\nafterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay\nsuit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as\nwell as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, \"Ain't\nwe fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha!\nha!\"[Illustration: Gravely promenaded to and fro]Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it\nshould offend her majesty, Laurie tapped, and was graciously received."

  "content": "\"Sit down and rest while I put these things away; then I want to consult\nyou about a very serious matter,\" said Amy, when she had shown her\nsplendor, and driven Polly into a corner. \"That bird is the trial of my\nlife,\" she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while\nLaurie seated himself astride of a chair. \"Yesterday, when aunt was\nasleep, and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to\nsquall and flap about in his cage; so I went to let him out, and found a\nbig spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase; Polly\nmarched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase,\nsaying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, 'Come out and take a\nwalk, my dear.' I _couldn't_ help laughing, which made Poll swear, and\naunt woke up and scolded us both.\"\"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?\" asked Laurie,\nyawning.\"Yes; out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and\nscrambled up on aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! catch her! catch\nher!' as I chased the spider.\"That's a lie! Oh lor!\" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.\"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\" cried Laurie,\nshaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side, and gravely\ncroaked, \"Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\"\"Now I'm ready,\" said Amy, shutting the wardrobe, and taking a paper out\nof her pocket. \"I want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is\nlegal and right. I felt that I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and\nI don't want any ill-feeling over my tomb.\"[Illustration: Amy's Will]Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read\nthe following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the\nspelling:--\"MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT.\"I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, do give and\n    bequeethe all my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely\"To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of\n    art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he likes with.\"To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with\n    pockets,--also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.\"To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get\n    it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of\n    real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of\n    her 'little girl.'\"To Jo I leave my breast-pin, the one mended with sealing wax,\n    also my bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most\n    precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burnt up her\n    story.\"To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little\n    bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can\n    wear them being thin when she gets well.

I forgot it; but I want it done, though it will\nspoil my looks.\"Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he\namused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But\nwhen he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper, with trembling lips,\n\"Is there really any danger about Beth?\"\"I'm afraid there is; but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,\ndear;\" and Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which\nwas very comforting.When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and, sitting in the\ntwilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,\nfeeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the\nloss of her gentle little sister.[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Mrs. March would not leave Beth's side]XX.CONFIDENTIAL.I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the\nmother and daughters; such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to\ndescribe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely\nsaying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg's\ntender hope was realized; for when Beth woke from that long, healing\nsleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell _were_ the little rose\nand mother's face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled, and\nnestled close into the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry\nlonging was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls\nwaited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which\nclung to hers even in sleep. Hannah had \"dished up\" an astonishing\nbreakfast for the traveller, finding it impossible to vent her\nexcitement in any other way; and Meg and Jo fed their mother like\ndutiful young storks, while they listened to her whispered account of\nfather's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays\nwhich the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable\ncomfort Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out\nwith fatigue, anxiety, and cold."

With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off,\nMeg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten\nboats, safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave\nBeth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at,\ntouch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered\ntreasure.Laurie, meanwhile, posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well\nthat Aunt March actually \"sniffed\" herself, and never once said, \"I told\nyou so.\" Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good\nthoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her\ntears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never\neven thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in\nLaurie's opinion, that she behaved \"like a capital little woman.\" Even\nPolly seemed impressed, for he called her \"good girl,\" blessed her\nbuttons, and begged her to \"come and take a walk, dear,\" in his most\naffable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright\nwintry weather; but, discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in\nspite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest\non the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time\nabout it; and, when she returned, he was stretched out, with both arms\nunder his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the\ncurtains, and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake till night,\nand I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by\nAmy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good\nmany happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my\nprivate opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her\nmother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation\nin the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone\ntogether in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its\npurpose was explained to her."

There are a good\nmany hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we\nask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this?\"\"Yes, mother; and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big\ncloset to put my books, and the copy of that picture which I've tried to\nmake. The woman's face is not good,--it's too beautiful for me to\ndraw,--but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to\nthink He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and\nthat helps me.\"As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ-child on his mother's knee, Mrs.\nMarch saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. She said\nnothing, but Amy understood the look, and, after a minute's pause, she\nadded gravely,--\"I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the\nring to-day; she called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my\nfinger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me\nalways. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it's too\nbig. I'd like to wear them, mother; can I?\"\"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such\nornaments, Amy,\" said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with\nthe band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard,\nformed of two tiny, golden hands clasped together.\"I'll try not to be vain,\" said Amy. \"I don't think I like it only\nbecause it's so pretty; but I want to wear it as the girl in the story\nwore her bracelet, to remind me of something.\"\"Do you mean Aunt March?\" asked her mother, laughing.\"No, to remind me not to be selfish.\" Amy looked so earnest and sincere\nabout it, that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to\nthe little plan."

He was perfectly open\nand honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a\ncomfortable home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our\nleave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him\nif he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse\nto listen to him; but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so\nyoung.\"\"Of course not; it would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing;\nI felt it; and now it's worse than I imagined.

I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable\nposition, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with\nlove and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your\ngood fortune; but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can\nbe had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and\nsome privations give sweetness to the few pleasures.

Meg observed\nit, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned\nthat the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt\nsure of being told everything if she did not ask. She was rather\nsurprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed\na patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in her turn\nassumed an air of dignified reserve, and devoted herself to her mother.\nThis left Jo to her own devices; for Mrs. March had taken her place as\nnurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long\nconfinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge; and, much as\nshe enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an\nincorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax her secret from her.She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a\nmystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of\nit. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected\nindifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he\nknew, then that he didn't care; and, at last, by dint of perseverance,\nhe satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling\nindignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his\nwits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter, and was absorbed in\npreparations for her father's return; but all of a sudden a change\nseemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike\nherself.

Margaret,\ntell me the whole story,\" commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet\nkeeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.\"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew\nanything about it,\" began Meg, without looking up. \"I was worried at\nfirst, and meant to tell you; then I remembered how you liked Mr.\nBrooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a\nfew days. I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew; and, while I\nwas deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such\nthings to do. Forgive me, mother, I'm paid for my silliness now; I never\ncan look him in the face again.\"\"What did you say to him?\" asked Mrs. March.\"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet; that I didn't\nwish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father. I was very\ngrateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more,\nfor a long while.\"Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,\nexclaiming, with a laugh,--\"You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence!\nTell on, Meg. What did he say to that?\"\"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent\nany love-letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,\nshould take such liberties with our names. It's very kind and\nrespectful, but think how dreadful for me!\"Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo\ntramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden she\nstopped, caught up the two notes, and, after looking at them closely,\nsaid decidedly, \"I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these\nletters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with, because\nI wouldn't tell him my secret.\"\"Don't have any secrets, Jo; tell it to mother, and keep out of trouble,\nas I should have done,\" said Meg warningly.\"Bless you, child! Mother told me.\""

I shall\nsift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at once.\"Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings.\n\"Now, dear, what are your own? Do you love him enough to wait till he\ncan make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the\npresent?\"\"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do\nwith lovers for a long while,--perhaps never,\" answered Meg petulantly.\n\"If John _doesn't_ know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him,\nand make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won't be deceived and\nplagued and made a fool of,--it's a shame!\"Seeing that Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by\nthis mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire\nsilence, and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie's step\nwas heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received\nthe culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he\nwouldn't come; but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and\nstood twirling his hat, with a guilty air which convicted him at once.\nJo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a\nsentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of\nvoices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour; but what happened\nduring that interview the girls never knew.When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother, with such\na penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it\nwise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, and was much\ncomforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.\"I'll never tell him to my dying day,--wild horses sha'n't drag it out\nof me; so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how\nout-and-out sorry I am,\" he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.\"I'll try; but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do. I didn't think\nyou could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,\" replied Meg, trying to hide\nher maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air."

Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face\nrelaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him\ndeclare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and\nabase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and\nsucceeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire\ndisapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but, as she showed\nno sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till\nthe others were done with him, when he made her a low bow, and walked\noff without a word.As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving; and when\nMeg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely, and longed for Teddy.\nAfter resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and, armed\nwith a book to return, went over to the big house.\"Is Mr. Laurence in?\" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming down\nstairs.\"Yes, miss; but I don't believe he's seeable just yet.\"\"Why not? is he ill?\"\"La, no, miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of\nhis tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I\ndursn't go nigh him.\"\"Where is Laurie?\"\"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been a-tapping. I\ndon't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's ready, and there's\nno one to eat it.\"\"I'll go and see what the matter is. I'm not afraid of either of them.\"Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.\"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!\" called out the young\ngentleman, in a threatening tone.Jo immediately knocked again; the door flew open, and in she bounced,\nbefore Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that he really\n_was_ out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite\nexpression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,\n\"Please forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, and can't\ngo away till I have.\"\"It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo,\" was the cavalier\nreply to her petition.[Illustration: Get up and don't be a goose]\"Thank you; I will. Could I ask what's the matter?

I'd\npromised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word.\"\"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?\"\"No; he _would_ have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\ntruth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing\nMeg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the\nold gentleman collared me. Then I got angry, and bolted, for fear I\nshould forget myself.\"\"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know; so go down and make up. I'll\nhelp you.\"\"Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by every\none, just for a bit of a frolic.

It's no use, Jo;\nhe's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, and don't need\nany one's apron-string to hold on by.\"\"What pepper-pots you are!\" sighed Jo. \"How do you mean to settle this\naffair?\"\"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't tell\nhim what the fuss's about.\"\"Bless you! he won't do that.\"\"I won't go down till he does.\"\"Now, Teddy, be sensible; let it pass, and I'll explain what I can.

She was tired of care and confinement, longed for\nchange, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel\ncharms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun.

Jo skipped up, and,\nsitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was\nreally wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her\nvisit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her\nmind; for, after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced\nround on her, speaking so abruptly that \"Rasselas\" tumbled face downward\non the floor.\"What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him. I know he has\nbeen in mischief by the way he acted when he came home.

If he's done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg\npardon, and be punished.

Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all\nday, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats, at first, and, in time,\nwith doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behindhand. Her once active\nlimbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her a daily airing about the\nhouse in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burnt her white\nhands cooking delicate messes for \"the dear;\" while Amy, a loyal slave\nof the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her\ntreasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,\nand Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible\nor magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry\nChristmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had\nbonfires, sky-rockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.\nAfter many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered\neffectually quenched, and went about with forlorn faces, which were\nrather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid\nChristmas Day. Hannah \"felt in her bones\" that it was going to be an\nunusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for\neverybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To\nbegin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them; then Beth\nfelt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's\ngift,--a soft crimson merino wrapper,--was borne in triumph to the\nwindow to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had\ndone their best to be worthy of the name, for, like elves, they had\nworked by night, and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden\nstood a stately snow-maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of\nfruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of new music in the other, a\nperfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas\ncarol issuing from her lips, on a pink paper streamer:--\"THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH.\"God bless you, dear Queen Bess!\n          May nothing you dismay,\n         But health and peace and happiness\n          Be yours, this Christmas Day.\"Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,\n          And flowers for her nose;\n         Here's music for her pianee,\n          An Afghan for her toes.\"A portrait of Joanna, see,\n          By Raphael No. 2,\n         Who labored with great industry\n          To make it fair and true."
