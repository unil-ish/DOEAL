  "content": "I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March\nfamily, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious\nand important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of\ndiscretion; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their\nrights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their elders do.\nIf there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoilt by\nadoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most\nremarkable children ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they\nwalked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two\nyears they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety\nwhich charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy demanded a \"needler,\" and\nactually made a bag with four stitches in it; she likewise set up\nhousekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking-stove\nwith a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's eyes, while Demi\nlearned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of\nteaching the alphabet by forming the letters with his arms and legs,\nthus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early developed a\nmechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother,\nfor he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a\nchaotic condition, with his \"sewin-sheen,\"--a mysterious structure of\nstring, chairs, clothes-pins, and spools, for wheels to go \"wound and\nwound;\" also a basket hung over the back of a big chair, in which he\nvainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine\ndevotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the\nyoung inventor indignantly remarked, \"Why, marmar, dat's my lellywaiter,\nand me's trying to pull her up.\"Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well\ntogether, and seldom quarrelled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi\ntyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other\naggressor; while Daisy made a galley-slave of herself, and adored her\nbrother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny\nlittle soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and\nnestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to be\nkissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and\nproduced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small\nvirtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few\nsmall naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair\nweather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window\nin her little night-gown to look out, and say, no matter whether it\nrained or shone, \"Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!\" Every one was a friend,\nand she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most\ninveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful\nworshippers.[Illustration: Me loves evvybody]\"Me loves evvybody,\" she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in\none hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish\nthe whole world.As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dove-cote would be blest\nby the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had\nhelped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared\na loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had\nentertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often called her \"Beth,\"\nand her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if\ntrying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could\nsee.Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know\neverything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get\nsatisfactory answers to his perpetual \"What for?\""

God winds you\nup, and you go till He stops you.\"\"Does I?\" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the\nnew thought. \"Is I wounded up like the watch?\"\"Yes; but I can't show you how; for it is done when we don't see.\"Demi felt of his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the\nwatch, and then gravely remarked,--\"I dess Dod does it when I's asleep.\"A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively that\nhis anxious grandmother said,--\"My dear, do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby?\nHe's getting great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most\nunanswerable questions.\"\"If he is old enough to ask the questions he is old enough to receive\ntrue answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping\nhim unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are,\nand I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.\nNow, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind?\"If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, \"By the gods, Socrates, I cannot\ntell,\" his grandfather would not have been surprised; but when, after\nstanding a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he\nanswered, in a tone of calm conviction, \"In my little belly,\" the old\ngentleman could only join in grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in\nmetaphysics."

But Demi corners her by the cool reply,--\"Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins.\""

  "content": "Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and _confidante_ of both children, and the\ntrio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a\nname to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but\nAunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for which\ncompliment she was deeply grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo\nneglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their\nlittle souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost\nher best customer and became bankrupt; Demi, with infantile penetration,\nsoon discovered that Dodo liked to play with \"the bear-man\" better than\nshe did with him; but, though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he\nhadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate-drops in\nhis waistcoat-pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case\nand freely shaken by ardent admirers.Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes;\nbut Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize the\n\"bear-man\" with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small\naffections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her\nthrone, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures of surpassing worth.Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the\nyoung relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard; but this\ncounterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not\ndeceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however\nlikewise effective,--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law;\nhe was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked\nparticularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his\nmanly one. His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day,\nbut evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always asked\nfor Mr. March, so I suppose _he_ was the attraction. The excellent papa\nlabored under the delusion that he was, and revelled in long discussions\nwith the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing\ngrandson suddenly enlightened him.Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,\nastonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone upon the floor lay\nMr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,\nlikewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own\nshort, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovellers so seriously absorbed\nthat they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his\nsonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face,--\"Father, father, here's the Professor!\"Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor\nsaid, with undisturbed dignity,--\"Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for a moment; we are just finishing\nour lesson. Now, Demi, make the letter and tell its name.\""

What did the little Mary say to that?\"\nasked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon\nhis knee, exploring the waistcoat-pocket.\"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. _Don't_ little\nboys like little girls?\" added Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of\nbland satisfaction.\"You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?\" said Jo, enjoying\nthe innocent revelations as much as the Professor.\"'Tisn't in mine head; it's in mine mouf,\" answered literal Demi,\nputting out his tongue, with a chocolate-drop on it, thinking she\nalluded to confectionery, not ideas.\"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend: sweets to the sweet,\nmannling;\" and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her\nwonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also saw\nthe smile, was impressed by it, and artlessly inquired,--\"Do great boys like great girls, too, 'Fessor?\"Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer \"couldn't tell a lie;\" so he gave the\nsomewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone that\nmade Mr. March put down his clothes-brush, glance at Jo's retiring face,\nand then sink into his chair, looking as if the \"precocious chick\" had\nput an idea into _his_ head that was both sweet and sour."

He was always walking rapidly, and\nnever seemed to see her till quite close, when he would look as if his\nshort-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till\nthat moment. Then, if she was going to Meg's, he always had something\nfor the babies; if her face was turned homeward, he had merely strolled\ndown to see the river, and was just about returning, unless they were\ntired of his frequent calls.Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and\ninvite him in? If she _was_ tired of his visits, she concealed her\nweariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee\nfor supper, \"as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn't like tea.\"By the second week, every one knew perfectly well what was going on, yet\nevery one tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in\nJo's face. They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her hair\nthree times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise; and no\none seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while\ntalking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter lessons in\nlove."

She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,\nafter her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her\nespecial dread; but, thanks to the new manager, he behaved with\npraiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer \"a capital old fellow\" in\npublic, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's improved\nappearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's\nhat on the Marches' hall-table nearly every evening. But he exulted in\nprivate and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of\nplate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate\ncoat-of-arms.For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity;\nthen he stayed away for three whole days, and made no sign,--a\nproceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to become\npensive, at first, and then--alas for romance!--very cross.\"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It's\nnothing to me, of course; but I _should_ think he would have come and\nbid us good-by, like a gentleman,\" she said to herself, with a\ndespairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary\nwalk, one dull afternoon.\"You'd better take the little umbrella, dear; it looks like rain,\" said\nher mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not alluding\nto the fact.\"Yes, Marmee; do you want anything in town? I've got to run in and get\nsome paper,\" returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the\nglass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.\"Yes; I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and\ntwo yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your thick boots on,\nand something warm under your cloak?\"\"I believe so,\" answered Jo absently.\"If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long to\nsee the dear man,\" added Mrs. March.Jo heard _that_, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk\nrapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her\nheartache,--\"How good she is to me!

Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten\nto take in her hurry to be off; but regret was unavailing, and nothing\ncould be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. She looked up at\nthe lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked with black,\nforward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering look behind, at\na certain grimy warehouse, with \"Hoffmann, Swartz, & Co.\" over the door,\nand said to herself, with a sternly reproachful air,--\"It serves me right!

No, you shall _not_ go there to borrow an umbrella, or\nfind out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do\nyour errands in the rain; and if you catch your death and ruin your\nbonnet, it's no more than you deserve. Now then!\"With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly\nescaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself into\nthe arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, \"I beg pardon, ma'am,\"\nand looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself,\nspread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and, putting\ntemptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the\nankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a\nsomewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected\nbonnet, attracted her attention; and, looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer\nlooking down.[Illustration: Looking up she saw Mr. Bhaer]\"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many\nhorse-noses, and so fast through much mud. What do you down here, my\nfriend?\"\"I'm shopping.\"Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle-factory on one side, to\nthe wholesale hide and leather concern on the other; but he only said\npolitely,--\"You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take for you the bundles?\"\"Yes, thank you.\"Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought\nof her; but she didn't care, for in a minute she found herself walking\naway arm-in-arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly\nburst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,\nand that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that\nday."

It won't take long.\"Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and\nparticularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and despatch\nwith which she would accomplish the business. But, owing to the flutter\nshe was in, everything went amiss; she upset the tray of needles, forgot\nthe silesia was to be \"twilled\" till it was cut off, gave the wrong\nchange, and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon\nat the calico counter.

Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own, and\nfinished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy\ndaisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a\ndemijohn.

Of course, she was the first\nto speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks which followed\nher impetuous \"Oh, yes!\" were not of a coherent or reportable\ncharacter.\"Friedrich, why didn't you--\"\"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!\"\ncried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful\ndelight.\"I always call you so to myself--I forgot; but I won't, unless you like\nit.\"\"Like it? it is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say 'thou,' also, and\nI shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.\"\"Isn't 'thou' a little sentimental?\" asked Jo, privately thinking it a\nlovely monosyllable.\"Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and keep\nourselves young mit it. Your English 'you' is so cold, say 'thou,'\nheart's dearest, it means so much to me,\" pleaded Mr. Bhaer, more like a\nromantic student than a grave professor.\"Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?\" asked Jo\nbashfully."
