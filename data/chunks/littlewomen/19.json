  "content": "The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own\ndress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely\neclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that \"her ladyship\" was altogether\na most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as she watched the pair,\n\"How well they look together! I was right, and Laurie has found the\nbeautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy\nold Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.\" Mrs. March and her\nhusband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they saw\nthat their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but the\nbetter wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful\nheart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool, prim carriage\nwas changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning. No little\naffectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more\ncharming than the new beauty or the old grace, for it stamped her at\nonce with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to\nbecome.\"Love has done much for our little girl,\" said her mother softly.\"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,\" Mr. March\nwhispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside\nhim.Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her \"pitty aunty,\" but\nattached herself like a lap-dog to the wonderful châtelaine full of\ndelightful charms. Demi paused to consider the new relationship before\nhe compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took the\ntempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement\nproduced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew where to\nhave him.\"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you\nhit me in the face: now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman;\" and\nwith that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew\nin a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted\nhis boyish soul.[Illustration: The tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small\n                                nephew]\"Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot? Ain't it a relishin'\nsight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks\ncalling little Amy, Mis. Laurence?\" muttered old Hannah, who could not\nresist frequent \"peeks\" through the slide as she set the table in a most\ndecidedly promiscuous manner."

  "content": "Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all\nburst out together, trying to tell the history of three years in half an\nhour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and\nprovide refreshment, for they would have been hoarse and faint if they\nhad gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into the\nlittle dining-room! Mr. March proudly escorted \"Mrs. Laurence;\" Mrs.\nMarch as proudly leaned on the arm of \"my son;\" the old gentleman took\nJo, with a whispered \"You must be my girl now,\" and a glance at the\nempty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, with trembling\nlips, \"I'll try to fill her place, sir.\"The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for\nevery one was so busy with the new-comers that they were left to revel\nat their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the\nopportunity. Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread _ab\nlibitum_, get a hot biscuit apiece, and, as a crowning trespass, didn't\nthey each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets, there\nto stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human nature\nand pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the\nsequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the\nthin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little\nsinners attached themselves to \"Dranpa,\" who hadn't his spectacles on.\nAmy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on\nFather Laurence's arm; the others paired off as before, and this\narrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the minute,\nfor she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry,--\"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (_coupé_), and use all them lovely\nsilver dishes that's stored away over yander?\"\"Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and\nwore diamonds and point-lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing too good\nfor her,\" returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.\"No more there is! Will you have hash or fish-balls for breakfast?\"\nasked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose."

  "content": "\"I don't care;\" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an\nuncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the party\nvanishing above, and, as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last\nstair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she\nlooked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,\nfor even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift was\ncoming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to\nherself, \"I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed; it won't do to be\ndismal now.\" Then she drew her hand over her eyes,--for one of her\nboyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was,--and had\njust managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the\nporch-door.She opened it with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had\ncome to surprise her; for there stood a tall, bearded gentleman, beaming\non her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\"O Mr. Bhaer, I _am_ so glad to see you!\" cried Jo, with a clutch, as if\nshe feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.[Illustration: O Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you]\"And I to see Miss Marsch,--but no, you haf a party--\" and the Professor\npaused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to\nthem.\"No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have just come\nhome, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us.\"Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously\naway, and come again another day; but how could he, when Jo shut the\ndoor behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had\nsomething to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,\nand showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary\nman, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all. You\nhaf been ill, my friend?\"He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light\nfell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you\nlast.\"\"Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that;\" and he\nshook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no\ncomfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,\nwarm hand.\"Father, mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,\" she said, with a\nface and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as\nwell have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish."

  "content": "If the stranger had had any doubts about his reception, they were set at\nrest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Every one greeted\nhim kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his\nown. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all\nhearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once, feeling even the\nmore friendly because he was poor; for poverty enriches those who live\nabove it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer\nsat looking about him with the air of a traveller who knocks at a\nstrange door, and, when it opens, finds himself at home. The children\nwent to him like bees to a honey-pot; and, establishing themselves on\neach knee, proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling\nhis beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The\nwomen telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling\nthat he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his\nguest's benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but\nsaid not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have\namused her; for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like\nsuspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe\nthe new-comer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.\nHe got interested in spite of himself, and, before he knew it, was drawn\ninto the circle; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,\nand did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him\noften, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own\nlost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eye would\nturn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute\ninquiry if she had seen it; but Jo had her own eyes to take care of,\nand, feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on\nthe little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt."

  "content": "A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water\nafter a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious\nomens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, and\nlooked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and\nhandsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she\nusually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite\ninspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the\nconversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic.\nJo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and\nthought to herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, \"How he\nwould enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!\"\nLastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him\nlook more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and\nsmoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for, in exciting\nmoments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do; and Jo liked\nit rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his\nfine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that\nplain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing\nescape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold\nsleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands!\"Dear old fellow! He couldn't have got himself up with more care if he'd\nbeen going a-wooing,\" said Jo to herself; and then a sudden thought,\nborn of the words, made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her\nball, and go down after it to hide her face.The manœuvre did not succeed as well as she expected, however; for,\nthough just in the act of setting fire to a funeral-pile, the Professor\ndropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the\nlittle blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,\nsaw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to\nresume their seats, wishing they had not left them.Nobody knew where the evening went to; for Hannah skilfully abstracted\nthe babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.\nLaurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking\naway, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal\nmind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of\nbed, and Demi set his night-gown afire studying the structure of\nmatches, made a move to go.\"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together\nagain once more,\" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and\npleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.They were not _all_ there. But no one found the words thoughtless or\nuntrue; for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,\ninvisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the\nhousehold league that love made indissoluble. The little chair stood in\nits old place; the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished\nwhen the needle grew \"so heavy,\" was still on its accustomed shelf; the\nbeloved instrument, seldom touched now, had not been moved; and above it\nBeth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon\nthem, seeming to say, \"Be happy. I am here.\""

Let them hear how much you have improved,\" said\nLaurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool,--\"Not to-night, dear. I can't show off to-night.\"But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill; for she sung\nBeth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master\ncould not have taught, and touched the listeners' hearts with a sweeter\npower than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very\nstill, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth's\nfavorite hymn. It was hard to say,--\"Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;\"and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that\nher welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.\"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song; for Mr. Bhaer sings that,\" said\nJo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with\na gratified \"Hem!\" as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood,\nsaying,--\"You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.\"A pleasing fiction, by the way; for Jo had no more idea of music than a\ngrasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a\nwhole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.\nIt didn't much matter; for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily\nand well; and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen\nto the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.[Illustration: Mr. Bhaer sang heartily]\"Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,\"used to be the Professor's favorite line, for \"das land\" meant Germany\nto him; but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,\nupon the words,--\"There, oh there, might I with thee,\n         O my beloved, go!\"and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she\nlonged to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither\nwhenever he liked."

  "content": "The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered\nwith laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners\nentirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet; for she had been\nintroduced simply as \"my sister,\" and no one had called her by her new\nname since he came. He forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in\nhis most gracious manner, at parting,--\"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that\nthere is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\"Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly\nilluminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most\ndelightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\"I too shall go; but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me\nleave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here\nsome days.\"He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo; and the mother's voice gave\nas cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes; for Mrs. March was not\nso blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.\"I suspect that is a wise man,\" remarked Mr. March, with placid\nsatisfaction, from the hearth-rug, after the last guest had gone.\"I know he is a good one,\" added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as\nshe wound up the clock.\"I thought you'd like him,\" was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her\nbed.She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,\nand finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,\nsomewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen\nhis face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a\nsevere and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to\nbe gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the\nsubject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture\nin the dark.[Illustration: Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap]XLIV.MY LORD AND LADY.\"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The\nluggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris finery, trying\nto find some things I want,\" said Laurie, coming in the next day to find\nMrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as if being made \"the baby\"\nagain."

Come home, dear,\nand I'll find your bootjack; I suppose that's what you are rummaging\nafter among my things. Men are _so_ helpless, mother,\" said Amy, with a\nmatronly air, which delighted her husband.\"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?\" asked\nJo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.\"We have our plans; we don't mean to say much about them yet, because we\nare such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle. I'm going into\nbusiness with a devotion that shall delight grandfather, and prove to\nhim that I'm not spoilt. I need something of the sort to keep me steady.\nI'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.\"\"And Amy, what is she going to do?\" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at\nLaurie's decision, and the energy with which he spoke.\"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall\nastonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant\nsociety we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall\nexert over the world at large.

Happy Amy!\" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as\nProfessor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the\nbootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, who was flitting about,\narranging her new art treasures,--\"Mrs. Laurence.\"\"My lord!\"\"That man intends to marry our Jo!\"\"I hope so; don't you, dear?\"\"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that\nexpressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal\nricher.\"\"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love\none another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.\nWomen _never_ should marry for money--\" Amy caught herself up short as\nthe words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with\nmalicious gravity,--\"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend\nto do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought it your\nduty to make a rich match; that accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a\ngood-for-nothing like me.\"\"O my dearest boy, don't, don't say that! I forgot you were rich when I\nsaid 'Yes.' I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I sometimes\nwish you _were_ poor that I might show how much I love you;\" and Amy,\nwho was very dignified in public and very fond in private, gave\nconvincing proofs of the truth of her words.\"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be\nonce, do you? It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd\ngladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your\nliving by rowing on the lake.\""

I\ndon't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder of my\nhandsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your nose is\n_such_ a comfort to me;\" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature\nwith artistic satisfaction.Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that\nsuited him better, as he plainly showed, though he did laugh at his\nwife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly,--\"May I ask you a question, dear?\"\"Of course you may.\"\"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?\"\"Oh, that's the trouble, is it?

There's one sort of poverty\nthat I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of,\nbut poor gentlefolks fare badly, because they won't ask, and people\ndon't dare to offer charity; yet there are a thousand ways of helping\nthem, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not\noffend.

Those are people whom it's a\nsatisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be\nallowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of\nfuel to keep the pot boiling; if they haven't, it's a pleasure to\ncomfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it\nout.\"\"Yes, indeed; and there's another class who can't ask, and who suffer in\nsilence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you made a\nprincess of me, as the king does the beggar-maid in the old story.\nAmbitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see youth,\nhealth, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a little help\nat the right minute.

  "content": "I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March\nfamily, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious\nand important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of\ndiscretion; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their\nrights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their elders do.\nIf there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoilt by\nadoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most\nremarkable children ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they\nwalked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two\nyears they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety\nwhich charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy demanded a \"needler,\" and\nactually made a bag with four stitches in it; she likewise set up\nhousekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking-stove\nwith a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's eyes, while Demi\nlearned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of\nteaching the alphabet by forming the letters with his arms and legs,\nthus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early developed a\nmechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother,\nfor he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a\nchaotic condition, with his \"sewin-sheen,\"--a mysterious structure of\nstring, chairs, clothes-pins, and spools, for wheels to go \"wound and\nwound;\" also a basket hung over the back of a big chair, in which he\nvainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine\ndevotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the\nyoung inventor indignantly remarked, \"Why, marmar, dat's my lellywaiter,\nand me's trying to pull her up.\"Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well\ntogether, and seldom quarrelled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi\ntyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other\naggressor; while Daisy made a galley-slave of herself, and adored her\nbrother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny\nlittle soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and\nnestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to be\nkissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and\nproduced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small\nvirtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few\nsmall naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair\nweather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window\nin her little night-gown to look out, and say, no matter whether it\nrained or shone, \"Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!\" Every one was a friend,\nand she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most\ninveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful\nworshippers.[Illustration: Me loves evvybody]\"Me loves evvybody,\" she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in\none hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish\nthe whole world.As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dove-cote would be blest\nby the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had\nhelped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared\na loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had\nentertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often called her \"Beth,\"\nand her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if\ntrying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could\nsee.Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know\neverything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get\nsatisfactory answers to his perpetual \"What for?\""

God winds you\nup, and you go till He stops you.\"\"Does I?\" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the\nnew thought. \"Is I wounded up like the watch?\"\"Yes; but I can't show you how; for it is done when we don't see.\"Demi felt of his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the\nwatch, and then gravely remarked,--\"I dess Dod does it when I's asleep.\"A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively that\nhis anxious grandmother said,--\"My dear, do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby?\nHe's getting great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most\nunanswerable questions.\"\"If he is old enough to ask the questions he is old enough to receive\ntrue answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping\nhim unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are,\nand I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.\nNow, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind?\"If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, \"By the gods, Socrates, I cannot\ntell,\" his grandfather would not have been surprised; but when, after\nstanding a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he\nanswered, in a tone of calm conviction, \"In my little belly,\" the old\ngentleman could only join in grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in\nmetaphysics."

But Demi corners her by the cool reply,--\"Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins.\""

  "content": "Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and _confidante_ of both children, and the\ntrio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a\nname to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but\nAunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for which\ncompliment she was deeply grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo\nneglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their\nlittle souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost\nher best customer and became bankrupt; Demi, with infantile penetration,\nsoon discovered that Dodo liked to play with \"the bear-man\" better than\nshe did with him; but, though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he\nhadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate-drops in\nhis waistcoat-pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case\nand freely shaken by ardent admirers.Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes;\nbut Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize the\n\"bear-man\" with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small\naffections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her\nthrone, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures of surpassing worth.Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the\nyoung relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard; but this\ncounterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not\ndeceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however\nlikewise effective,--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law;\nhe was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked\nparticularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his\nmanly one. His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day,\nbut evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always asked\nfor Mr. March, so I suppose _he_ was the attraction. The excellent papa\nlabored under the delusion that he was, and revelled in long discussions\nwith the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing\ngrandson suddenly enlightened him.Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,\nastonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone upon the floor lay\nMr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,\nlikewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own\nshort, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovellers so seriously absorbed\nthat they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his\nsonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face,--\"Father, father, here's the Professor!\"Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor\nsaid, with undisturbed dignity,--\"Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for a moment; we are just finishing\nour lesson. Now, Demi, make the letter and tell its name.\""

What did the little Mary say to that?\"\nasked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon\nhis knee, exploring the waistcoat-pocket.\"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. _Don't_ little\nboys like little girls?\" added Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of\nbland satisfaction.\"You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?\" said Jo, enjoying\nthe innocent revelations as much as the Professor.\"'Tisn't in mine head; it's in mine mouf,\" answered literal Demi,\nputting out his tongue, with a chocolate-drop on it, thinking she\nalluded to confectionery, not ideas.\"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend: sweets to the sweet,\nmannling;\" and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her\nwonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also saw\nthe smile, was impressed by it, and artlessly inquired,--\"Do great boys like great girls, too, 'Fessor?\"Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer \"couldn't tell a lie;\" so he gave the\nsomewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone that\nmade Mr. March put down his clothes-brush, glance at Jo's retiring face,\nand then sink into his chair, looking as if the \"precocious chick\" had\nput an idea into _his_ head that was both sweet and sour."

  "content": "Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china-closet half an hour\nafterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a\ntender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she\nfollowed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice\nof bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi puzzled\nhis small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades]XLVI.UNDER THE UMBRELLA.While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets,\nas they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr.\nBhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy\nroads and sodden fields.\"I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why I should\ngive it up, just because I often happen to meet the Professor on his way\nout,\" said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters; for, though\nthere were two paths to Meg's, whichever one she took she was sure to\nmeet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and\nnever seemed to see her till quite close, when he would look as if his\nshort-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till\nthat moment. Then, if she was going to Meg's, he always had something\nfor the babies; if her face was turned homeward, he had merely strolled\ndown to see the river, and was just about returning, unless they were\ntired of his frequent calls.Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and\ninvite him in? If she _was_ tired of his visits, she concealed her\nweariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee\nfor supper, \"as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn't like tea.\"By the second week, every one knew perfectly well what was going on, yet\nevery one tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in\nJo's face. They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her hair\nthree times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise; and no\none seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while\ntalking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter lessons in\nlove."

She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,\nafter her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her\nespecial dread; but, thanks to the new manager, he behaved with\npraiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer \"a capital old fellow\" in\npublic, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's improved\nappearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's\nhat on the Marches' hall-table nearly every evening. But he exulted in\nprivate and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of\nplate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate\ncoat-of-arms.For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity;\nthen he stayed away for three whole days, and made no sign,--a\nproceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to become\npensive, at first, and then--alas for romance!--very cross.\"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It's\nnothing to me, of course; but I _should_ think he would have come and\nbid us good-by, like a gentleman,\" she said to herself, with a\ndespairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary\nwalk, one dull afternoon.\"You'd better take the little umbrella, dear; it looks like rain,\" said\nher mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not alluding\nto the fact.\"Yes, Marmee; do you want anything in town? I've got to run in and get\nsome paper,\" returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the\nglass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.\"Yes; I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and\ntwo yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your thick boots on,\nand something warm under your cloak?\"\"I believe so,\" answered Jo absently.\"If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long to\nsee the dear man,\" added Mrs. March.Jo heard _that_, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk\nrapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her\nheartache,--\"How good she is to me! What _do_ girls do who haven't any mothers to\nhelp them through their troubles?\""

Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten\nto take in her hurry to be off; but regret was unavailing, and nothing\ncould be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. She looked up at\nthe lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked with black,\nforward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering look behind, at\na certain grimy warehouse, with \"Hoffmann, Swartz, & Co.\" over the door,\nand said to herself, with a sternly reproachful air,--\"It serves me right! What business had I to put on all my best things\nand come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor? Jo, I'm\nashamed of you! No, you shall _not_ go there to borrow an umbrella, or\nfind out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do\nyour errands in the rain; and if you catch your death and ruin your\nbonnet, it's no more than you deserve. Now then!\"With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly\nescaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself into\nthe arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, \"I beg pardon, ma'am,\"\nand looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself,\nspread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and, putting\ntemptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the\nankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a\nsomewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected\nbonnet, attracted her attention; and, looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer\nlooking down.[Illustration: Looking up she saw Mr. Bhaer]\"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many\nhorse-noses, and so fast through much mud. What do you down here, my\nfriend?\"\"I'm shopping.\"Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle-factory on one side, to\nthe wholesale hide and leather concern on the other; but he only said\npolitely,--\"You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take for you the bundles?\"\"Yes, thank you.\"Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought\nof her; but she didn't care, for in a minute she found herself walking\naway arm-in-arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly\nburst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,\nand that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that\nday."
