Of course there was a general stampede; and for several\nminutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things\nwere done, and no one said a word. Mr. March became invisible in the\nembrace of four pairs of loving arms; Jo disgraced herself by nearly\nfainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china-closet; Mr.\nBrooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently\nexplained; and Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and, never\nstopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in the most\ntouching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held\nup her hand with a warning, \"Hush! remember Beth!\"But it was too late; the study door flew open, the little red wrapper\nappeared on the threshold,--joy put strength into the feeble limbs,--and\nBeth ran straight into her father's arms. Never mind what happened just\nafter that; for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness\nof the past, and leaving only the sweetness of the present.It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight\nagain, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat\nturkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the\nkitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for\nhis faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly\nremembered that Mr. March needed rest, and, seizing Laurie, he\nprecipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,\nwhich they did, by both sitting in one big chair, and talking hard.Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the\nfine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage\nof it; how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most\nestimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just\nthere, and, after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,\nlooked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you\nto imagine; also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head, and asked,\nrather abruptly, if he wouldn't have something to eat. Jo saw and\nunderstood the look; and she stalked grimly away to get wine and\nbeef-tea, muttering to herself, as she slammed the door, \"I hate\nestimable young men with brown eyes!\""

The fat\nturkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned,\nand decorated; so was the plum-pudding, which quite melted in one's\nmouth; likewise the jellies, in which Amy revelled like a fly in a\nhoney-pot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,\n\"For my mind was that flustered, mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't\nroast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'\nof it in a cloth.\"Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke,--at whom\nJo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy-chairs\nstood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her\nfather, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank\nhealths, told stories, sung songs, \"reminisced,\" as the old folks say,\nand had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh-ride had been planned, but the\ngirls would not leave their father; so the guests departed early, and,\nas twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.\"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected\nto have. Do you remember?\" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had\nfollowed a long conversation about many things.\"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!\" said Meg, smiling at the fire,\nand congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.\"I think it's been a pretty hard one,\" observed Amy, watching the light\nshine on her ring, with thoughtful eyes.\"I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,\" whispered Beth, who\nsat on her father's knee.\"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially\nthe latter part of it. But you have got on bravely; and I think the\nburdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,\" said Mr. March,\nlooking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered\nround him.\"How do you know? Did mother tell you?\" asked Jo.\"Not much; straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several\ndiscoveries to-day.\"\"Oh, tell us what they are!\" cried Meg, who sat beside him."

It was very\npretty then, but to me it is much prettier now,--for in these seeming\nblemishes I read a little history. A burnt-offering has been made of\nvanity; this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters;\nand I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long\ntime, so much good-will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value\nthe womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or\nfashionable accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious\nlittle hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away.\"If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it\nin the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he\ngave her.\"What about Jo? Please say something nice; for she has tried so hard,\nand been so very, very good to me,\" said Beth, in her father's ear.He laughed, and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an\nunusually mild expression in her brown face.\"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a year\nago,\" said Mr. March. \"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight,\nlaces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on\nthe rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale, just now,\nwith watching and anxiety; but I like to look at it, for it has grown\ngentler, and her voice is lower; she doesn't bounce, but moves quietly,\nand takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which\ndelights me. I rather miss my wild girl; but if I get a strong, helpful,\ntender-hearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't\nknow whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in\nall Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought\nwith the five-and-twenty dollars which my good girl sent me.\"Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy\nin the firelight, as she received her father's praise, feeling that she\ndid deserve a portion of it.\"Now Beth,\" said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.\"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will\nslip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,\" began\ntheir father cheerfully; but recollecting how nearly he _had_ lost her,\nhe held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own,\n\"I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God.\"After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket\nat his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair,--"

I also observe that she does\nnot fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very\npretty ring which she wears; so I conclude that she has learned to think\nof other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and\nmould her character as carefully as she moulds her little clay figures.\nI am glad of this; for though I should be very proud of a graceful\nstatue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter,\nwith a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.\"\"What are you thinking of, Beth?\" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her\nfather and told about her ring.\"I read in 'Pilgrim's Progress' to-day, how, after many troubles,\nChristian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow, where lilies\nbloomed all the year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,\nbefore they went on to their journey's end,\" answered Beth; adding, as\nshe slipped out of her father's arms, and went slowly to the instrument,\n\"It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I'll try to\nsing the song of the shepherd-boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the\nmusic for father, because he likes the verses.\"So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and,\nin the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sung to her own\naccompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song for\nher:--\"He that is down need fear no fall,\n          He that is low no pride;\n         He that is humble ever shall\n          Have God to be his guide.\"I am content with what I have,\n          Little be it or much;\n         And, Lord! contentment still I crave,\n          Because Thou savest such.\"Fulness to them a burden is,\n          That go on pilgrimage;\n         Here little, and hereafter bliss,\n          Is best from age to age!\"XXIII.AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION.[Illustration: Popping in her head now and then]"

As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with the\nother three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then, \"to\npeek at the dear man,\" nothing seemed needed to complete their\nhappiness. But something _was_ needed, and the elder ones felt it,\nthough none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another\nwith an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden\nfits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's\numbrella, which had been left in the hall; Meg was absent-minded, shy,\nand silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was\nmentioned; Amy said \"Every one seemed waiting for something, and\ncouldn't settle down, which was queer, since father was safe at home,\"\nand Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as\nusual.[Illustration: \"He sat in the big chair by Beth's sofa with the other\n                      three close by.\"--Page 277.]Laurie went by in the afternoon, and, seeing Meg at the window, seemed\nsuddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down upon one\nknee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands\nimploringly, as if begging some boon; and when Meg told him to behave\nhimself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,\nand staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.\"What does the goose mean?\" said Meg, laughing, and trying to look\nunconscious.\"He's showing you how your John will go on by and by. Touching, isn't\nit?\" answered Jo scornfully.\"Don't say _my John_, it isn't proper or true;\" but Meg's voice lingered\nover the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. \"Please don't plague\nme, Jo; I've told you I don't care _much_ about him, and there isn't to\nbe anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before.\"\"We can't, for something _has_ been said, and Laurie's mischief has\nspoilt you for me. I see it, and so does mother; you are not like your\nold self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't mean to\nplague you, and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all\nsettled. I hate to wait; so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and\nhave it over quickly,\" said Jo pettishly.\"_I_ can't say or do anything till he speaks, and he won't, because\nfather said I was too young,\" began Meg, bending over her work, with a\nqueer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with\nher father on that point.\"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or blush,\nor let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided, No.\"\"I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say,\nfor I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares; there's no\nknowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.\""

I don't believe you'll ever say it,\nand I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the\nrejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his\nfeelings.\"\"No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk out\nof the room with dignity.\"Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified\nexit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat, and begin to\nsew as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given\ntime. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and, when some one gave\na modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect, which was anything but\nhospitable.\"Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella,--that is, to see how your\nfather finds himself to-day,\" said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused\nas his eye went from one tell-tale face to the other."

But the instant she vanished, Meg began to\nsidle towards the door, murmuring,--\"Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her.\"\"Don't go; are you afraid of me, Margaret?\" and Mr. Brooke looked so\nhurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She\nblushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called\nher Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet\nit seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her\nease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said\ngratefully,--\"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to father? I only wish I\ncould thank you for it.\"[Illustration: Shall I tell you how?]\"Shall I tell you how?\" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in\nboth his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown\neyes, that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away\nand to stop and listen.\"Oh no, please don't--I'd rather not,\" she said, trying to withdraw her\nhand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.\"I won't trouble you, I only want to know if you care for me a little,\nMeg. I love you so much, dear,\" added Mr. Brooke tenderly.This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make it;\nshe forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, \"I don't\nknow,\" so softly, that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish\nlittle reply.He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as\nif quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said, in his\nmost persuasive tone, \"Will you try and find out? I want to know _so_\nmuch; for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am\nto have my reward in the end or not.\"\"I'm too young,\" faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet\nrather enjoying it.\"I'll wait; and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me.

This nettled\nher; Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and\nthe love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little\nwomen, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt\nexcited and strange, and, not knowing what else to do, followed a\ncapricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, \"I\n_don't_ choose. Please go away and let me be!\"Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling\nabout his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it\nrather bewildered him.\"Do you really mean that?\" he asked anxiously, following her as she\nwalked away.\"Yes, I do; I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says I\nneedn't; it's too soon and I'd rather not.\"\"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by and by? I'll wait, and say\nnothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I didn't\nthink that of you.\"\"Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't,\" said Meg, taking a\nnaughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel\nheroes whom she admired; but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped\nabout the room, as they did; he just stood looking at her so wistfully,\nso tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of her.

The family were all busy in the back part\nof the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise\nthem. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she\nhad seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\"Bless me, what's all this?\" cried the old lady, with a rap of her cane,\nas she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.[Illustration: Bless me, what's all this?]\"It's father's friend. I'm _so_ surprised to see you!\" stammered Meg,\nfeeling that she was in for a lecture now.\"That's evident,\" returned Aunt March, sitting down. \"But what is\nfather's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief\ngoing on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,\" with another rap.\"We were merely talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,\" began Meg,\nwishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.\"Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it.

If you do, not one penny of my\nmoney ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible girl,\" said the\nold lady impressively.Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of\nopposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of us\nhave a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in\nlove. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would\nprobably have declared she couldn't think of it; but as she was\nperemptorily ordered _not_ to like him, she immediately made up her mind\nthat she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision\neasy, and, being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with\nunusual spirit.\"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money\nto any one you like,\" she said, nodding her head with a resolute air."

Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so\nbrave and independent,--so glad to defend John, and assert her right to\nlove him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and,\nafter a little pause, made a fresh start, saying, as mildly as she\ncould, \"Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable, and take my advice.

Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower-bath had\nsuddenly fallen upon her,--for such an unexpected turning of the tables\nactually took her breath away.

Amy\nwas very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity.

Now we shall have a little\nsensible conversation.\"But Jo was mistaken; for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with\nspirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for \"Mrs. John Brooke,\"\nand evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been\nbrought about by his excellent management.[Illustration: For Mrs. John Brooke]\"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does; for when\nhe makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done, though the sky\nfalls,\" said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his\ncongratulations.\"Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for the\nfuture, and invite you to my wedding on the spot,\" answered Mr. Brooke,\nwho felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.\"I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth; for the sight of Jo's face\nalone, on that occasion, would be worth a long journey. You don't look\nfestive, ma'am; what's the matter?\" asked Laurie, following her into a\ncorner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence."

You only go halves,\" said Laurie consolingly.\"It never can be the same again. I've lost my dearest friend,\" sighed\nJo.\"You've got me, anyhow. I'm not good for much, I know; but I'll stand\nby you, Jo, all the days of my life; upon my word I will!\" and Laurie\nmeant what he said.\"I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged; you are always a great\ncomfort to me, Teddy,\" returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.\"Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow. It's all right, you\nsee. Meg is happy; Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately;\ngrandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her\nown little house. We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I\nshall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad, or some\nnice trip or other. Wouldn't that console you?\"\"I rather think it would; but there's no knowing what may happen in\nthree years,\" said Jo thoughtfully.\"That's true. Don't you wish you could take a look forward, and see\nwhere we shall all be then? I do,\" returned Laurie.\"I think not, for I might see something sad; and every one looks so\nhappy now, I don't believe they could be much improved,\" and Jo's eyes\nwent slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the prospect\nwas a pleasant one."

Amy was drawing\nthe lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light\nof which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not\ncopy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who\nheld her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead\nhim along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low\nseat, with the grave, quiet look which best became her; and Laurie,\nleaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly\nhead, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long\nglass which reflected them both.*       *       *       *       *So grouped, the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it\never rises again, depends upon the reception given to the first act of\nthe domestic drama called \"LITTLE WOMEN.\"[Illustration: Home of the Little Women]The Second Part[Illustration: The Dove Cote]XXIV.GOSSIP.In order that we may start afresh, and go to Meg's wedding with free\nminds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.\nAnd here let me premise, that if any of the elders think there is too\nmuch \"lovering\" in the story, as I fear they may (I'm not afraid the\nyoung folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March,\n\"What _can_ you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a\ndashing young neighbor over the way?\"The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the\nquiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with\nhis books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature\nas by grace,--a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better\nthan learning, the charity which calls all mankind \"brother,\" the piety\nthat blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which\nshut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many\nadmirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as\nnaturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard\nexperience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the\ngray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled\nwomen instinctively brought their doubts and sorrows to him, sure of\nfinding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel; sinners told their\nsins to the pure-hearted old man, and were both rebuked and saved;\ngifted men found a companion in him; ambitious men caught glimpses of\nnobler ambitions than their own; and even worldlings confessed that his\nbeliefs were beautiful and true, although \"they wouldn't pay.\""

He received no stars or bars, but he\ndeserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had; and life and love\nare very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his\ndischarge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business,\nand earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence\nthat characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more generous offers,\nand accepted the place of book-keeper feeling better satisfied to begin\nwith an honestly-earned salary, than by running any risks with borrowed\nmoney."

She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt\nsome disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin.\nNed Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help\ncontrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid\noutfit, with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But\nsomehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the\npatient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her;\nand when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small\nplans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot\nSallie's splendor, and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in\nChristendom.Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to\nAmy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of\nthe best teachers going; and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would\nhave served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her\nafternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo, meantime, devoted\nherself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the\nfever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again\nthe rosy, healthy creature she had been; yet always hopeful, happy, and\nserene, busy with the quiet duties she loved, every one's friend, and an\nangel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to\nknow it.As long as \"The Spread Eagle\" paid her a dollar a column for her\n\"rubbish,\" as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun\nher little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy\nbrain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a\nslowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place\nthe name of March upon the roll of fame.Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was\nnow getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please\nhimself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,\nand the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to\nget other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoilt,\nand probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had\nnot possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man\nwho was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over\nhim as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the\nknowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him\nwith all their hearts."

But as high spirits and the\nlove of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save\nhimself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible\npower of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather\nprided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with\ngraphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified\nprofessors, and vanquished enemies. The \"men of my class\" were heroes in\nthe eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of \"our\nfellows,\" and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these\ngreat creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among\nthem; for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of\nfascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her\nprivate and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and\nBeth too shy to do more than peep at them, and wonder how Amy dared to\norder them about so; but Jo felt quite in her element, and found it very\ndifficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases,\nand feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed\nfor young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love\nwith her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a\nsentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine.

  "content": "That was the name of the little brown house which Mr. Brooke had\nprepared for Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was\nhighly appropriate to the gentle lovers, who \"went on together like a\npair of turtle-doves, with first a bill and then a coo.\" It was a tiny\nhouse, with a little garden behind, and a lawn about as big as a\npocket-handkerchief in front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain,\nshrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers; though just at present,\nthe fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a\ndilapidated slop-bowl; the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,\nundecided whether to live or die; and the profusion of flowers was\nmerely hinted by regiments of sticks, to show where seeds were planted.\nBut inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault\nfrom garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow, it was\nfortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in\nwhole; the dining-room was so small that six people were a tight fit;\nand the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of\nprecipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coal-bin. But\nonce get used to these slight blemishes, and nothing could be more\ncomplete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the\nfurnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no\nmarble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little\nparlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a\nstand of flowers in the bay-window, and, scattered all about, the pretty\ngifts which came from friendly hands, and were the fairer for the loving\nmessages they brought.I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty\nbecause John put up the bracket it stood upon; that any upholsterer\ncould have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's\nartistic hand; or that any store-room was ever better provided with good\nwishes, merry words, and happy hopes, than that in which Jo and her\nmother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles; and I am morally\ncertain that the spandy-new kitchen never _could_ have looked so cosey\nand neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times\nover, and laid the fire all ready for lighting, the minute \"Mis. Brooke\ncame home.\" I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so\nrich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece-bags; for Beth made enough\nto last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three\ndifferent kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal\nchina.People who hire all these things done for them never know what they\nlose; for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,\nand Meg found so many proofs of this, that everything in her small nest,\nfrom the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was\neloquent of home love and tender forethought."

In his love of jokes, this\nyoung gentleman, though nearly through college, was as much of a boy as\never. His last whim had been to bring with him, on his weekly visits,\nsome new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a\nbag of remarkable clothes-pins; next, a wonderful nutmeg-grater, which\nfell to pieces at the first trial; a knife-cleaner that spoilt all the\nknives; or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet, and left\nthe dirt; labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands;\ninfallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the\ndeluded buyer; and every kind of tin-ware, from a toy savings-bank for\nodd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own\nsteam, with every prospect of exploding in the process.In vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him\n\"Mr. Toodles.\" He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee\ningenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week\nbeheld some fresh absurdity.Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored\nsoaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the table\nfor the first meal.\"Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you\nshould be happy here?\" asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went\nthrough the new kingdom, arm-in-arm; for just then they seemed to cling\ntogether more tenderly than ever.\"Yes, mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and _so_ happy\nthat I can't talk about it,\" answered Meg, with a look that was better\nthan words.\"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,\" said Amy,\ncoming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether\nthe bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantle-piece.\"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try\nher way first. There will be so little to do, that, with Lotty to run my\nerrands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to\nkeep me from getting lazy or homesick,\" answered Meg tranquilly.\"Sallie Moffat has four,\" began Amy.\"If Meg had four the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis\nwould have to camp in the garden,\" broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big\nblue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door-handles."

When I was first\nmarried, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so\nthat I might have the pleasure of mending them; for I got heartily sick\nof doing fancy work and tending my pocket handkerchief.\"\"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she\ndoes, to amuse herself, though they never turn out well, and the\nservants laugh at her,\" said Meg.\"I did, after a while; not to 'mess,' but to learn of Hannah how things\nshould be done, that my servants need _not_ laugh at me. It was play\nthen; but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only\npossessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little\ngirls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You\nbegin at the other end, Meg, dear; but the lessons you learn now will be\nof use to you by and by, when John is a richer man, for the mistress of\na house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she\nwishes to be well and honestly served.\"\"Yes, mother, I'm sure of that,\" said Meg, listening respectfully to the\nlittle lecture; for the best of women will hold forth upon the\nall-absorbing subject of housekeeping. \"Do you know I like this room\nmost of all in my baby-house,\" added Meg, a minute after, as they went\nupstairs, and she looked into her well-stored linen-closet."
