I wish I could run off too,\" said Jo, forgetting\nher part of Mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.\"Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and I'll stir\nup old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke; let's do it, Jo. We'll leave\na letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once. I've got money\nenough; it will do you good, and be no harm, as you go to your father.\"For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree; for, wild as the plan was,\nit just suited her. She was tired of care and confinement, longed for\nchange, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel\ncharms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her eyes kindled as they\nturned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house\nopposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.\"If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time; but as\nI'm a miserable girl, I must be proper, and stop at home. Don't tempt\nme, Teddy, it's a crazy plan.\"\"That's the fun of it,\" began Laurie, who had got a wilful fit on him,\nand was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.\"Hold your tongue!\" cried Jo, covering her ears. \"'Prunes and prisms'\nare my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I came here to\nmoralize, not to hear about things that make me skip to think of.\"[Illustration: \"Hold your tongue!\" cried Jo, covering her ears]\"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had\nmore spirit,\" began Laurie insinuatingly.\"Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don't go making\nme add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will\nyou give up running away?\" asked Jo seriously.\"Yes, but you won't do it,\" answered Laurie, who wished \"to make up,\"\nbut felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.\"If I can manage the young one I can the old one,\" muttered Jo, as she\nwalked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map, with his head\npropped up on both hands."

I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the second\nvolume,\" returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second\ndose of Boswell's \"Johnson,\" as he had recommended that lively work.The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little, as he rolled the steps toward the\nshelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo skipped up, and,\nsitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was\nreally wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her\nvisit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her\nmind; for, after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced\nround on her, speaking so abruptly that \"Rasselas\" tumbled face downward\non the floor.\"What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him. I know he has\nbeen in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. I can't get a\nword from him; and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he\nbolted upstairs, and locked himself into his room.\"\"He did do wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word\nto any one,\" began Jo reluctantly.\"That won't do; he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you\nsoft-hearted girls. If he's done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg\npardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo, I won't be kept in the dark.\"Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have\ngladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps,\nand he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and\nbrave it out.[Illustration: He stood at the foot, like a lion in the path]"

We don't keep silence to\nshield him, but some one else, and it will make more trouble if you\ninterfere. Please don't; it was partly my fault, but it's all right now;\nso let's forget it, and talk about the 'Rambler,' or something\npleasant.\"\"Hang the 'Rambler!' come down and give me your word that this\nharum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or impertinent.\nIf he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll thrash him with my own\nhands.\"The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the\nirascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson,\nwhatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently descended, and\nmade as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or\nforgetting the truth.\"Hum--ha--well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and not\nfrom obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow, and hard to\nmanage,\" said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he\nhad been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with an\nair of relief.\"So am I; but a kind word will govern me when all the king's horses and\nall the king's men couldn't,\" said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her\nfriend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.\"You think I'm not kind to him, hey?\" was the sharp answer.\"Oh, dear, no, sir; you are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a\ntrifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don't you think you are?\"Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,\nthough she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief\nand surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles on to the\ntable with a rattle, and exclaimed frankly,--\"You're right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience past\nbearing, and I don't know how it will end, if we go on so.\"\"I'll tell you, he'll run away.\" Jo was sorry for that speech the\nminute it was made; she meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear\nmuch restraint, and hoped he would be more forbearing with the lad."

It was Laurie's father, who _had_ run away in his youth, and\nmarried against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered\nand regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.\"He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it\nsometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often think I should like\nto, especially since my hair was cut; so, if you ever miss us, you may\nadvertise for two boys, and look among the ships bound for India.\"She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently\ntaking the whole as a joke.\"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where's your respect for me,\nand your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What torments\nthey are; yet we can't do without them,\" he said, pinching her cheeks\ngood-humoredly. \"Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it's\nall right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his\ngrandfather. I won't bear it.\"\"He won't come, sir; he feels badly because you didn't believe him when\nhe said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very\nmuch.\"Jo tried to look pathetic, but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began\nto laugh, and she knew the day was won.\"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking _me_, I\nsuppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?\" and the old gentleman\nlooked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.\"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, sir. He says he won't come\ndown till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an\nabsurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and\nbring him down quite amiable. Try it; he likes fun, and this way is\nbetter than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty.\"Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying\nslowly, \"You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and\nBeth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this\nnonsense.\""

Finding the door locked\nagain, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly away,\nwhen the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at\nthe bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of countenance,\n\"What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?\" he added,\nlaughing.\"No; he was pretty mild, on the whole.\"\"Ah!

She\nnever alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good deal,\ndreamed dreams more than ever; and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk\nfor stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, \"Mrs.\nJohn Brooke;\" whereat she groaned tragically, and cast it into the fire,\nfeeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day for her.[Illustration: Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day]XXII.PLEASANT MEADOWS."

  "content": "Like sunshine after storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. The\ninvalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning\nearly in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all\nday, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats, at first, and, in time,\nwith doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behindhand. Her once active\nlimbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her a daily airing about the\nhouse in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burnt her white\nhands cooking delicate messes for \"the dear;\" while Amy, a loyal slave\nof the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her\ntreasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,\nand Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible\nor magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry\nChristmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had\nbonfires, sky-rockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.\nAfter many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered\neffectually quenched, and went about with forlorn faces, which were\nrather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid\nChristmas Day. Hannah \"felt in her bones\" that it was going to be an\nunusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for\neverybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To\nbegin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them; then Beth\nfelt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's\ngift,--a soft crimson merino wrapper,--was borne in triumph to the\nwindow to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had\ndone their best to be worthy of the name, for, like elves, they had\nworked by night, and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden\nstood a stately snow-maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of\nfruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of new music in the other, a\nperfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas\ncarol issuing from her lips, on a pink paper streamer:--\"THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH.\"God bless you, dear Queen Bess!\n          May nothing you dismay,\n         But health and peace and happiness\n          Be yours, this Christmas Day.\"Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,\n          And flowers for her nose;\n         Here's music for her pianee,\n          An Afghan for her toes.\"A portrait of Joanna, see,\n          By Raphael No. 2,\n         Who labored with great industry\n          To make it fair and true."

Half an hour\nafter every one had said they were so happy they could only hold one\ndrop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door, and popped his\nhead in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault and\nuttered an Indian war-whoop; for his face was so full of suppressed\nexcitement and his voice so treacherously joyful, that every one jumped\nup, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, \"Here's another\nChristmas present for the March family.\""

Of course there was a general stampede; and for several\nminutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things\nwere done, and no one said a word. Mr. March became invisible in the\nembrace of four pairs of loving arms; Jo disgraced herself by nearly\nfainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china-closet; Mr.\nBrooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently\nexplained; and Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and, never\nstopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in the most\ntouching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held\nup her hand with a warning, \"Hush! remember Beth!\"But it was too late; the study door flew open, the little red wrapper\nappeared on the threshold,--joy put strength into the feeble limbs,--and\nBeth ran straight into her father's arms. Never mind what happened just\nafter that; for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness\nof the past, and leaving only the sweetness of the present.It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight\nagain, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat\nturkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the\nkitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for\nhis faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly\nremembered that Mr. March needed rest, and, seizing Laurie, he\nprecipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,\nwhich they did, by both sitting in one big chair, and talking hard.Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the\nfine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage\nof it; how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most\nestimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just\nthere, and, after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,\nlooked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you\nto imagine; also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head, and asked,\nrather abruptly, if he wouldn't have something to eat. Jo saw and\nunderstood the look; and she stalked grimly away to get wine and\nbeef-tea, muttering to herself, as she slammed the door, \"I hate\nestimable young men with brown eyes!\""

The fat\nturkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned,\nand decorated; so was the plum-pudding, which quite melted in one's\nmouth; likewise the jellies, in which Amy revelled like a fly in a\nhoney-pot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,\n\"For my mind was that flustered, mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't\nroast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'\nof it in a cloth.\"Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke,--at whom\nJo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy-chairs\nstood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her\nfather, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank\nhealths, told stories, sung songs, \"reminisced,\" as the old folks say,\nand had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh-ride had been planned, but the\ngirls would not leave their father; so the guests departed early, and,\nas twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.\"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected\nto have. Do you remember?\" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had\nfollowed a long conversation about many things.\"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!\" said Meg, smiling at the fire,\nand congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.\"I think it's been a pretty hard one,\" observed Amy, watching the light\nshine on her ring, with thoughtful eyes.\"I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,\" whispered Beth, who\nsat on her father's knee.\"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially\nthe latter part of it.

It was very\npretty then, but to me it is much prettier now,--for in these seeming\nblemishes I read a little history. A burnt-offering has been made of\nvanity; this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters;\nand I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long\ntime, so much good-will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value\nthe womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or\nfashionable accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious\nlittle hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away.\"If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it\nin the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he\ngave her.\"What about Jo? Please say something nice; for she has tried so hard,\nand been so very, very good to me,\" said Beth, in her father's ear.He laughed, and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an\nunusually mild expression in her brown face.\"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a year\nago,\" said Mr. March. \"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight,\nlaces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on\nthe rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale, just now,\nwith watching and anxiety; but I like to look at it, for it has grown\ngentler, and her voice is lower; she doesn't bounce, but moves quietly,\nand takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which\ndelights me. I rather miss my wild girl; but if I get a strong, helpful,\ntender-hearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't\nknow whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in\nall Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought\nwith the five-and-twenty dollars which my good girl sent me.\"Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy\nin the firelight, as she received her father's praise, feeling that she\ndid deserve a portion of it.\"Now Beth,\" said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.\"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will\nslip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,\" began\ntheir father cheerfully; but recollecting how nearly he _had_ lost her,\nhe held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own,\n\"I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God.\"After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket\nat his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair,--"

Touching, isn't\nit?\" answered Jo scornfully.\"Don't say _my John_, it isn't proper or true;\" but Meg's voice lingered\nover the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. \"Please don't plague\nme, Jo; I've told you I don't care _much_ about him, and there isn't to\nbe anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before.\"\"We can't, for something _has_ been said, and Laurie's mischief has\nspoilt you for me. I see it, and so does mother; you are not like your\nold self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't mean to\nplague you, and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all\nsettled. I hate to wait; so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and\nhave it over quickly,\" said Jo pettishly.\"_I_ can't say or do anything till he speaks, and he won't, because\nfather said I was too young,\" began Meg, bending over her work, with a\nqueer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with\nher father on that point.\"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or blush,\nor let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided, No.\"\"I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say,\nfor I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares; there's no\nknowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.\""

I don't believe you'll ever say it,\nand I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the\nrejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his\nfeelings.\"\"No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk out\nof the room with dignity.\"Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified\nexit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat, and begin to\nsew as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given\ntime. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and, when some one gave\na modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect, which was anything but\nhospitable.\"Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella,--that is, to see how your\nfather finds himself to-day,\" said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused\nas his eye went from one tell-tale face to the other."

But the instant she vanished, Meg began to\nsidle towards the door, murmuring,--\"Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her.\"\"Don't go; are you afraid of me, Margaret?\" and Mr. Brooke looked so\nhurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She\nblushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called\nher Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet\nit seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her\nease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said\ngratefully,--\"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to father? I only wish I\ncould thank you for it.\"[Illustration: Shall I tell you how?]\"Shall I tell you how?\" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in\nboth his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown\neyes, that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away\nand to stop and listen.\"Oh no, please don't--I'd rather not,\" she said, trying to withdraw her\nhand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.\"I won't trouble you, I only want to know if you care for me a little,\nMeg. I love you so much, dear,\" added Mr. Brooke tenderly.This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make it;\nshe forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, \"I don't\nknow,\" so softly, that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish\nlittle reply.He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as\nif quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said, in his\nmost persuasive tone, \"Will you try and find out? I want to know _so_\nmuch; for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am\nto have my reward in the end or not.\"\"I'm too young,\" faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet\nrather enjoying it.\"I'll wait; and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me. Would\nit be a very hard lesson, dear?\"\"Not if I chose to learn it, but--\""

This nettled\nher; Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and\nthe love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little\nwomen, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt\nexcited and strange, and, not knowing what else to do, followed a\ncapricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, \"I\n_don't_ choose. Please go away and let me be!\"Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling\nabout his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it\nrather bewildered him.\"Do you really mean that?\" he asked anxiously, following her as she\nwalked away.\"Yes, I do; I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says I\nneedn't; it's too soon and I'd rather not.\"\"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by and by? I'll wait, and say\nnothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I didn't\nthink that of you.\"\"Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't,\" said Meg, taking a\nnaughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel\nheroes whom she admired; but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped\nabout the room, as they did; he just stood looking at her so wistfully,\nso tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of her. What\nwould have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come\nhobbling in at this interesting minute."

The family were all busy in the back part\nof the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise\nthem. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she\nhad seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\"Bless me, what's all this?\" cried the old lady, with a rap of her cane,\nas she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.[Illustration: Bless me, what's all this?]\"It's father's friend. I'm _so_ surprised to see you!\" stammered Meg,\nfeeling that she was in for a lecture now.\"That's evident,\" returned Aunt March, sitting down. \"But what is\nfather's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief\ngoing on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,\" with another rap.\"We were merely talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,\" began Meg,\nwishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.\"Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it.

If you do, not one penny of my\nmoney ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible girl,\" said the\nold lady impressively.Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of\nopposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of us\nhave a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in\nlove. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would\nprobably have declared she couldn't think of it; but as she was\nperemptorily ordered _not_ to like him, she immediately made up her mind\nthat she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision\neasy, and, being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with\nunusual spirit.\"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money\nto any one you like,\" she said, nodding her head with a resolute air."

Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so\nbrave and independent,--so glad to defend John, and assert her right to\nlove him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and,\nafter a little pause, made a fresh start, saying, as mildly as she\ncould, \"Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable, and take my advice.

You ought to marry well, and help your family; it's\nyour duty to make a rich match, and it ought to be impressed upon you.\"\"Father and mother don't think so; they like John, though he _is_ poor.\"\"Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than two babies.\"\"I'm glad of it,\" cried Meg stoutly.Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. \"This Rook is\npoor, and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?\"\"No; but he has many warm friends.\"\"You can't live on friends; try it, and see how cool they'll grow.

So you intend to marry a man without money, position,\nor business, and go on working harder than you do now, when you might be\ncomfortable all your days by minding me and doing better? I thought you\nhad more sense, Meg.\"\"I couldn't do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise;\nhe's got heaps of talent; he's willing to work, and sure to get on, he's\nso energetic and brave. Every one likes and respects him, and I'm proud\nto think he cares for me, though I'm so poor and young and silly,\" said\nMeg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.\"He knows _you_ have got rich relations, child; that's the secret of his\nliking, I suspect.\""

You are a wilful child, and\nyou've lost more than you know by this piece of folly.

She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her; for, when\nleft alone, Meg stood a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.\nBefore she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.\nBrooke, who said, all in one breath, \"I couldn't help hearing, Meg.\nThank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you _do_\ncare for me a little bit.\"\"I didn't know how much, till she abused you,\" began Meg.\"And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?\"Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately\nexit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced herself\nforever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, \"Yes, John,\" and hiding her\nface on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly down\nstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and, hearing no sound\nwithin, nodded and smiled, with a satisfied expression, saying to\nherself, \"She has sent him away as we planned, and that affair is\nsettled.

Going in to exult over a fallen enemy,\nand to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an\nobjectionable lover, it certainly _was_ a shock to behold the aforesaid\nenemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strong-minded sister\nenthroned upon his knee, and wearing an expression of the most abject\nsubmission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower-bath had\nsuddenly fallen upon her,--for such an unexpected turning of the tables\nactually took her breath away. At the odd sound, the lovers turned and\nsaw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy; but \"that man,\" as\nJo called him, actually laughed, and said coolly, as he kissed the\nastonished new-comer, \"Sister Jo, congratulate us!\"That was adding insult to injury,--it was altogether too much,--and,\nmaking some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a\nword. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming\ntragically, as she burst into the room, \"Oh, _do_ somebody go down\nquick; John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!\"Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed; and, casting herself upon\nthe bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news\nto Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered it a most\nagreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them; so\nshe went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles to\nthe rats.Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon; but a great\ndeal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by\nthe eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his plans,\nand persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.The tea-bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which\nhe meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both\nlooking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy\nwas very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity. Beth\nbeamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the\nyoung couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident\nAunt March was right in calling them as \"unworldly as a pair of babies.\"\nNo one ate much, but every one looked very happy, and the old room\nseemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family\nbegan there.\"You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?\" said\nAmy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in the sketch she\nwas planning to take.\"No, I'm sure I can't.
