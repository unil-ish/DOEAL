  "content": "\"A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there, and\nthey give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, of course? Aunt\nwill be charmed.\"\"Thank you. Where now?\" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his arms,\na proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive; for her\nparasol-whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs, afforded her\ninfinite satisfaction.\"I'm going to the banker's first, for letters, and then to Castle Hill;\nthe view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever\nbeen there?\"\"Often, years ago; but I don't mind having a look at it.\"\"Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your\ngrandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.\"\"Yes, I spent a month there, and then joined him in Paris, where he has\nsettled for the winter. He has friends there, and finds plenty to amuse\nhim; so I go and come, and we get on capitally.\"\"That's a sociable arrangement,\" said Amy, missing something in Laurie's\nmanner, though she couldn't tell what.\"Why, you see he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still; so we each\nsuit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with him, and he\nenjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that some one is glad to see\nme when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn't it?\" he\nadded, with a look of disgust, as they drove along the boulevard to the\nPlace Napoleon, in the old city.\"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the hills are\ndelicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross-streets are my\ndelight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass; it's\ngoing to the Church of St. John.\""

  "content": "While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their\ncanopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some brotherhood\nin blue, chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt a new sort\nof shyness steal over her; for he was changed, and she could not find\nthe merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside her. He was\nhandsomer than ever, and greatly improved, she thought; but now that the\nflush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired and\nspiritless,--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a\nyear or two of prosperous life should have made him. She couldn't\nunderstand it, and did not venture to ask questions; so she shook her\nhead, and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the\narches of the Paglioni bridge, and vanished in the church.\"_Que pensez vous_?\" she said, airing her French, which had improved in\nquantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.\"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is\ncharming,\" replied Laurie, bowing, with his hand on his heart, and an\nadmiring look.She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy\nher like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he\npromenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was\n\"altogether jolly,\" with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the\nhead. She didn't like the new tone; for, though not _blas√©_, it sounded\nindifferent in spite of the look.\"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy,\" she\nthought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying\nmeantime to seem quite easy and gay.At Avigdor's she found the precious home-letters, and, giving the reins\nto Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between\ngreen hedges, where tea-roses bloomed as freshly as in June.\"Beth is very poorly, mother says. I often think I ought to go home, but\nthey all say 'stay;' so I do, for I shall never have another chance like\nthis,\" said Amy, looking sober over one page.\"I think you are right, there; you could do nothing at home, and it is a\ngreat comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and enjoying\nso much, my dear.\"He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self, as he said\nthat; and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened,\nfor the look, the act, the brotherly \"my dear,\" seemed to assure her\nthat if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.\nPresently she laughed, and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her\nscribbling-suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing\nfrom her mouth the words, \"Genius burns!\"Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest-pocket, \"to keep it from\nblowing away,\" and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read\nhim."

  "content": "\"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the\nmorning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,\" said\nAmy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of\nsplendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.\nWhile Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs\nto the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,\nwith a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had\nwrought. He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and\napprove; for, overlooking a few little affectations of speech and\nmanner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of\nthat indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call\nelegance. Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain _aplomb_\nin both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman\nof the world than she was; but her old petulance now and then showed\nitself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was\nunspoiled by foreign polish.Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks, but\nhe saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a pretty\nlittle picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, which\nbrought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her cheeks,\nthe golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure in the\npleasant scene.As they came up on to the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved\nher hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing\nhere and there,--\"Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the fishermen dragging\ntheir nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert's\nTower, just below, and, best of all, that speck far out to sea which\nthey say is Corsica?\"\"I remember; it's not much changed,\" he answered, without enthusiasm.\"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!\" said Amy, feeling\nin good spirits, and anxious to see him so also.\"Yes,\" was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the\nisland which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting\nin his sight.\"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what you\nhave been doing with yourself all this while,\" said Amy, seating\nherself, ready for a good talk.But she did not get it; for, though he joined her, and answered all her\nquestions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the\ncontinent and been to Greece. So, after idling away an hour, they drove\nhome again; and, having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left\nthem, promising to return in the evening."

  "content": "It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately \"prinked\" that night.\nTime and absence had done its work on both the young people; she had\nseen her old friend in a new light, not as \"our boy,\" but as a handsome\nand agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to\nfind favor in his sight. Amy knew her good points, and made the most of\nthem, with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty\nwoman.Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them\non such occasions, and, following the sensible English fashion of simple\ndress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh\nflowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were\nboth inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist\nsometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique\n_coiffures_, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear\nheart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon\nsuch in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep\nour hearts merry with their artless vanities.\"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,\" said Amy\nto herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball-dress, and covered\nit with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white shoulders and\ngolden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair she had the\nsense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a\nHebe-like knot at the back of her head.\"It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a\nfright of myself,\" she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or\nbraid, as the latest style commanded.Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped\nher fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white\nshoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted boots, she\nsurveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and\n_chass√©ed_ down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.\"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the\nreal lace on aunt's _mouchoir_ gives an air to my whole dress. If I only\nhad a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,\" she said,\nsurveying herself with a critical eye, and a candle in each hand."

  "content": "In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as\nshe glided away; she seldom ran,--it did not suit her style, she\nthought, for, being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate\nthan the sportive or piquante. She walked up and down the long saloon\nwhile waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the\nchandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair; then she thought\nbetter of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed\nof the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so\nhappened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came in\nso quietly she did not hear him; and, as she stood at the distant\nwindow, with her head half turned, and one hand gathering up her dress,\nthe slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a\nwell-placed statue.\"Good evening, Diana!\" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she\nliked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.\"Good evening, Apollo!\" she answered, smiling back at him, for he, too,\nlooked unusually _debonnaire_, and the thought of entering the ball-room\non the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain\nMisses Davis from the bottom of her heart.\"Here are your flowers; I arranged them myself, remembering that you\ndidn't like what Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay,'\" said Laurie, handing her\na delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily\npassed it in Cardiglia's window.[Illustration: Here are your flowers]\"How kind you are!\" she exclaimed gratefully. \"If I'd known you were\ncoming I'd have had something ready for you to-day, though not as pretty\nas this, I'm afraid.\"\"Thank you; it isn't what it should be, but you have improved it,\" he\nadded, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.\"Please don't.\"\"I thought you liked that sort of thing?\"\"Not from you; it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old bluntness\nbetter.\"\"I'm glad of it,\" he answered, with a look of relief; then buttoned her\ngloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to do\nwhen they went to parties together, at home.The company assembled in the long _salle √† manger_, that evening, was\nsuch as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable Americans\nhad invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and, having no\nprejudice against titles, secured a few to add lustre to their Christmas\nball."

A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted\nhimself to the ladies, who pronounced him \"a fascinating dear,\" and a\nGerman Serene Something, having come for the supper alone, roamed\nvaguely about, seeking what he might devour. Baron Rothschild's private\nsecretary, a large-nosed Jew, in tight boots, affably beamed upon the\nworld, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo; a stout\nFrenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,\nand Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little\nfamily of eight. Of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced\nAmerican girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto, and a few\nplain but piquante French demoiselles; likewise the usual set of\ntravelling young gentlemen, who disported themselves gayly, while mammas\nof all nations lined the walls, and smiled upon them benignly when they\ndanced with their daughters.Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she \"took the stage\"\nthat night, leaning on Laurie's arm. She knew she looked well, she loved\nto dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ball-room,\nand enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls\nfirst discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by\nvirtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. She did pity the Davis girls,\nwho were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim papa and\nthree grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her friendliest\nmanner as she passed; which was good of her, as it permitted them to see\nher dress, and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking\nfriend might be. With the first burst of the band, Amy's color rose, her\neyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the floor impatiently; for\nshe danced well, and wanted Laurie to know it: therefore the shock she\nreceived can better be imagined than described, when he said, in a\nperfectly tranquil tone,--\"Do you care to dance?\"\"One usually does at a ball.\"Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as\nfast as possible.\"I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?\"\"I can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances divinely; but he\nwill excuse me, as you are an old friend,\" said Amy, hoping that the\nname would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be\ntrifled with.\"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support\"'A daughter of the gods,\n          Divinely tall, and most divinely fair,'\"was all the satisfaction she got, however."

  "content": "The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy\nwas compelled to walk decorously through a cotillon, feeling all the\nwhile as if she could dance the Tarantula with a relish. Laurie resigned\nher to the \"nice little boy,\" and went to do his duty to Flo, without\nsecuring Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of\nforethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself\ntill supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs of penitence.\nShe showed him her ball-book with demure satisfaction when he strolled,\ninstead of rushing, up to claim her for the next, a glorious\npolka-redowa; but his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when\nshe gallopaded away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt\nwith an actual expression of relief.That was unpardonable; and Amy took no more notice of him for a long\nwhile, except a word now and then, when she came to her chaperon,\nbetween the dances, for a necessary pin or a moment's rest. Her anger\nhad a good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and\nseemed unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie's eyes followed her with\npleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit\nand grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. He very\nnaturally fell to studying her from this new point of view; and, before\nthe evening was half over, had decided that \"little Amy was going to\nmake a very charming woman.\"It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took\npossession of every one, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,\nhearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, and banged\nas if they enjoyed it; everybody danced who could, and those who\ncouldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. The air was dark\nwith Davises, and many Joneses gambolled like a flock of young giraffes.\nThe golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor, with a\ndashing Frenchwoman, who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train.\nThe Serene Teuton found the supper-table, and was happy, eating steadily\nthrough the bill of fare, and dismayed the _gar√ßons_ by the ravages he\ncommitted. But the Emperor's friend covered himself with glory, for he\ndanced everything, whether he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu\npirouettes when the figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon of that\nstout man was charming to behold; for, though he \"carried weight,\" he\ndanced like an india-rubber ball. He ran, he flew, he pranced; his face\nglowed, his bald head shone; his coat-tails waved wildly, his pumps\nactually twinkled in the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the\ndrops from his brow, and beamed upon his fellow-men like a French\nPickwick without glasses."

When little Vladimir finally relinquished\nher, with assurances that he was \"desolated to leave so early,\" she was\nready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.It had been successful; for, at three-and-twenty, blighted affections\nfind a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young\nblood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the\nenchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. Laurie had a waked-up\nlook as he rose to give her his seat; and when he hurried away to bring\nher some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile,--\"Ah, I thought that would do him good!\"\"You look like Balzac's 'Femme peinte par elle-m√™me,'\" he said, as he\nfanned her with one hand, and held her coffee-cup in the other.\"My rouge won't come off;\" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and\nshowed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh\noutright.\"What do you call this stuff?\" he asked, touching a fold of her dress\nthat had blown over his knee.\"Illusion.\"\"Good name for it; it's very pretty--new thing, isn't it?\"\"It's as old as the hills; you have seen it on dozens of girls, and you\nnever found out that it was pretty till now--_stupide_!\"\"I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see.\"\"None of that, it is forbidden; I'd rather take coffee than compliments\njust now. No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous.\"Laurie sat bolt upright, and meekly took her empty plate, feeling an odd\nsort of pleasure in having \"little Amy\" order him about; for she had\nlost her shyness now, and felt an irresistible desire to trample on him,\nas girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any\nsigns of subjection.\"Where did you learn all this sort of thing?\" he asked, with a quizzical\nlook.\"As 'this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly\nexplain?\" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but\nwickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.\"Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession,\nthe--the--illusion--you know,\" laughed Laurie, breaking down, and\nhelping himself out of his quandary with the new word."

In America, as every one\nknows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their\nfreedom with republican zest; but the young matrons usually abdicate\nwith the first heir to the throne, and go into a seclusion almost as\nclose as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they\nlike it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the\nwedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a\nvery pretty woman the other day, \"I'm as handsome as ever, but no one\ntakes any notice of me because I'm married.\"Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience\nthis affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little world\nprimitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired and\nbeloved than ever."

Day and night she brooded\nover them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the tender\nmercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen\ndepartment. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely\nattentions he had been accustomed to receive; but, as he adored his\nbabies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing,\nwith masculine ignorance, that peace would soon be restored. But three\nmonths passed, and there was no return of repose; Meg looked worn and\nnervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the house was\nneglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life \"aisy,\" kept him on short\ncommons. When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small\ncommissions for the captive mamma; if he came gayly in at night, eager\nto embrace his family, he was quenched by a \"Hush! they are just asleep\nafter worrying all day.\" If he proposed a little amusement at home, \"No,\nit would disturb the babies.\" If he hinted at a lecture or concert, he\nwas answered with a reproachful look, and a decided \"Leave my children\nfor pleasure, never!\" His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions\nof a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the\nnight; his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the\npresiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp\nsounded from the nest above; and when he read his paper of an evening,\nDemi's colic got into the shipping-list, and Daisy's fall affected the\nprice of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of\nhis wife; home was merely a nursery, and the perpetual \"hushing\" made\nhim feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts\nof Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, and, when no\nsigns of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles\ndo,--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and gone\nto housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running over\nfor an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his\nown wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs. Scott was a\nlively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she\nperformed her mission most successfully. The parlor was always bright\nand attractive, the chess-board ready, the piano in tune, plenty of gay\ngossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely;\nbut as it was, he gratefully took the next best thing, and enjoyed his\nneighbor's society."

I often feel\nas if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for\neverything.\"Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and, with a little\ninterruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly\ntogether, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than\never.\"You have only made the mistake that most young wives make,--forgotten\nyour duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very natural\nand forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be remedied before\nyou take to different ways; for children should draw you nearer than\never, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and John had nothing\nto do but support them. I've seen it for some weeks, but have not\nspoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.\"\"I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm jealous; and\nI wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see that I want him,\nand I don't know how to tell him without words.\"\"Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away. My dear, he's longing for\nhis little home; but it isn't home without you, and you are always in\nthe nursery.\"\"Oughtn't I to be there?\"\"Not all the time; too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you\nare unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John as well\nas to the babies; don't neglect husband for children, don't shut him out\nof the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as\nwell as yours, and the children need him; let him feel that he has his\npart to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be\nbetter for you all.\"\"You really think so, mother?\""

Poor father took to his books, after I had refused all\noffers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled\nalong as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me. I nearly spoilt\nher by indulgence. You were poorly, and I worried about you till I fell\nsick myself.

You\nneed the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and John would find his\nwife again. Go out more; keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the\nsunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair\nweather. Then I'd try to take an interest in whatever John likes,--talk\nwith him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in\nthat way. Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman,\nbut understand what is going on, and educate yourself to take your part\nin the world's work, for it all affects you and yours.\"\"John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if I ask\nquestions about politics and things.\"\"I don't believe he would; love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom\ncould you ask more freely than of him? Try it, and see if he doesn't\nfind your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's suppers.\"\"I will. Poor John!

Don't let John be a stranger to\nthe babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this\nworld of trial and temptation than anything else, and through them you\nwill learn to know and love one another as you should. Now, dear,\ngood-by; think over mother's preachment, act upon it if it seems good,\nand God bless you all!\"Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the\nfirst attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. Of course\nthe children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as they\nfound out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted.\nMamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but papa was not so easily\nsubjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt\nat paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a\ntrifle of his sire's firmness of character,--we won't call it\nobstinacy,--and when he made up his little mind to have or to do\nanything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change\nthat pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be\ntaught to conquer his prejudices, but papa believed that it never was\ntoo soon to learn obedience; so Master Demi early discovered that when\nhe undertook to \"wrastle\" with \"parpar,\" he always got the worst of it;\nyet, like the Englishman, Baby respected the man who conquered him, and\nloved the father whose grave \"No, no,\" was more impressive than all\nmamma's love-pats.A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social\nevening with John; so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in\norder, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early, that\nnothing should interfere with her experiment. But, unfortunately, Demi's\nmost unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he\ndecided to go on a rampage; so poor Meg sung and rocked, told stories\nand tried every sleep-provoking wile she could devise, but all in vain,\nthe big eyes wouldn't shut; and long after Daisy had gone to byelow,\nlike the chubby little bunch of good-nature she was, naughty Demi lay\nstaring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression\nof countenance."

This tastes\nright. I drink your health, dear.\" And John sipped his tea with an air\nof reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration, however; for, as\nhe put down his cup, the door-handle rattled mysteriously, and a little\nvoice was heard, saying impatiently,--\"Opy doy; me's tummin!\"\"It's that naughty boy.

No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no\nstory; even the light was put out, and only the red glow of the fire\nenlivened the \"big dark\" which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than\nfear. This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for\n\"marmar,\" as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his\ntender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.

So held, John had waited\nwith womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold; and, while\nwaiting, had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle with his son than\nwith his whole day's work.As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to\nherself, and then slipped away again, saying, in a satisfied tone,--\"I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies: he _does_\nknow how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi _is_ getting\ntoo much for me.\"When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful\nwife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a bonnet,\nand to be greeted with the request to read something about the election,\nif he was not too tired.

He read a long debate\nwith the most amiable readiness, and then explained it in his most lucid\nmanner, while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent\nquestions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the\nnation to the state of her bonnet.

It was not all\nParadise by any means, but every one was better for the division of\nlabor system; the children throve under the paternal rule, for accurate,\nsteadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while Meg\nrecovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome\nexercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential conversation with her\nsensible husband.
