In America, as every one\nknows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their\nfreedom with republican zest; but the young matrons usually abdicate\nwith the first heir to the throne, and go into a seclusion almost as\nclose as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they\nlike it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the\nwedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a\nvery pretty woman the other day, \"I'm as handsome as ever, but no one\ntakes any notice of me because I'm married.\"Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience\nthis affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little world\nprimitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired and\nbeloved than ever."

Day and night she brooded\nover them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the tender\nmercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen\ndepartment. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely\nattentions he had been accustomed to receive; but, as he adored his\nbabies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing,\nwith masculine ignorance, that peace would soon be restored. But three\nmonths passed, and there was no return of repose; Meg looked worn and\nnervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the house was\nneglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life \"aisy,\" kept him on short\ncommons. When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small\ncommissions for the captive mamma; if he came gayly in at night, eager\nto embrace his family, he was quenched by a \"Hush! they are just asleep\nafter worrying all day.\" If he proposed a little amusement at home, \"No,\nit would disturb the babies.\" If he hinted at a lecture or concert, he\nwas answered with a reproachful look, and a decided \"Leave my children\nfor pleasure, never!\" His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions\nof a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the\nnight; his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the\npresiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp\nsounded from the nest above; and when he read his paper of an evening,\nDemi's colic got into the shipping-list, and Daisy's fall affected the\nprice of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of\nhis wife; home was merely a nursery, and the perpetual \"hushing\" made\nhim feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts\nof Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, and, when no\nsigns of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles\ndo,--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and gone\nto housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running over\nfor an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his\nown wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs. Scott was a\nlively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she\nperformed her mission most successfully. The parlor was always bright\nand attractive, the chess-board ready, the piano in tune, plenty of gay\ngossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely;\nbut as it was, he gratefully took the next best thing, and enjoyed his\nneighbor's society."

But by and\nby, when the teething worry was over, and the idols went to sleep at\nproper hours, leaving mamma time to rest, she began to miss John, and\nfind her work-basket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite in\nhis old dressing-gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender.\nShe would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured because he did\nnot know that she wanted him without being told, entirely forgetting the\nmany evenings he had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn\nout with watching and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind\nwhich the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares\noppress them. Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much\ndevotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them feel as\nif they were all nerve and no muscle.\"Yes,\" she would say, looking in the glass, \"I'm getting old and ugly;\nJohn doesn't find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife\nand goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances. Well, the\nbabies love me; they don't care if I am thin and pale, and haven't time\nto crimp my hair; they are my comfort, and some day John will see what\nI've gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious?\"To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a\ncrow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which\nsoothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as\npolitics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss\ninteresting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him.\nNot a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one\nday, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping\nspirits had not escaped her observation.\"I wouldn't tell any one except you, mother; but I really do need\nadvice, for, if John goes on so much longer I might as well be widowed,\"\nreplied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's bib, with an injured\nair.\"Goes on how, my dear?\" asked her mother anxiously.\"He's away all day, and at night, when I want to see him, he is\ncontinually going over to the Scotts'. It isn't fair that I should have\nthe hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish, even\nthe best of them.\"\"So are women; don't blame John till you see where you are wrong\nyourself.\"\"But it can't be right for him to neglect me.\"\"Don't you neglect him?\"\"Why, mother, I thought you'd take my part!\"\"So I do, as far as sympathizing goes; but I think the fault is yours,\nMeg.\"\"I don't see how.\"\"Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you\nmade it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only leisure\ntime?\"\"No; but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend.\""

I often feel\nas if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for\neverything.\"Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and, with a little\ninterruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly\ntogether, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than\never.\"You have only made the mistake that most young wives make,--forgotten\nyour duty to your husband in your love for your children.

Besides, you owe something to John as well\nas to the babies; don't neglect husband for children, don't shut him out\nof the nursery, but teach him how to help in it.

Poor father took to his books, after I had refused all\noffers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled\nalong as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me.

Don't let John be a stranger to\nthe babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this\nworld of trial and temptation than anything else, and through them you\nwill learn to know and love one another as you should. Now, dear,\ngood-by; think over mother's preachment, act upon it if it seems good,\nand God bless you all!\"Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the\nfirst attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. Of course\nthe children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as they\nfound out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted.\nMamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but papa was not so easily\nsubjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt\nat paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a\ntrifle of his sire's firmness of character,--we won't call it\nobstinacy,--and when he made up his little mind to have or to do\nanything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change\nthat pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be\ntaught to conquer his prejudices, but papa believed that it never was\ntoo soon to learn obedience; so Master Demi early discovered that when\nhe undertook to \"wrastle\" with \"parpar,\" he always got the worst of it;\nyet, like the Englishman, Baby respected the man who conquered him, and\nloved the father whose grave \"No, no,\" was more impressive than all\nmamma's love-pats.A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social\nevening with John; so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in\norder, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early, that\nnothing should interfere with her experiment. But, unfortunately, Demi's\nmost unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he\ndecided to go on a rampage; so poor Meg sung and rocked, told stories\nand tried every sleep-provoking wile she could devise, but all in vain,\nthe big eyes wouldn't shut; and long after Daisy had gone to byelow,\nlike the chubby little bunch of good-nature she was, naughty Demi lay\nstaring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression\nof countenance."

They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa to\nsketch; will you come?\" said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely day\nwhen he lounged in as usual, about noon.\"Well, yes; but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?\" he answered\nslowly, for the shaded _salon_ looked inviting, after the glare without.\"I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so\nyou'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves\nnice,\" returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,\nwhich were a weak point with Laurie.\"Then I'll go with pleasure;\" and he put out his hand for her\nsketch-book. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp--\"Don't trouble yourself; it's no exertion to me, but _you_ don't look\nequal to it.\"Laurie lifted his eyebrows, and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran\ndownstairs; but when they got into the carriage he took the reins\nhimself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and\nfall asleep on his perch.The two never quarrelled,--Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie\nwas too lazy; so, in a minute he peeped under her hat-brim with an\ninquiring air; she answered with a smile, and they went on together in\nthe most amicable manner."

  "content": "It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque\nscenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery,\nwhence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a\nbare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket\nover one shoulder, sat piping on a stone, while his goats skipped among\nthe rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with\npanniers of freshly-cut grass, passed by, with a pretty girl in a\n_capaline_ sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning\nwith a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the\nquaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on\nthe bough. Gnarled olive-trees covered the hills with their dusky\nfoliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones\nfringed the roadside; while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the\nMaritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.Valrosa well deserved its name, for, in that climate of perpetual\nsummer, roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust\nthemselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to\npassers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon-trees and\nfeathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where\nseats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom; every cool\ngrotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers, and every\nfountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to\nsmile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped\nthe cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of\nthe wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and\nthe white-walled city on its shore.\"This is a regular honeymoon Paradise, isn't it? Did you ever see such\nroses?\" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a\nluxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\"No, nor felt such thorns,\" returned Laurie, with his thumb in his\nmouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that\ngrew just beyond his reach."

  "content": "\"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,\" said Amy,\ngathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall\nbehind her. She put them in his button-hole, as a peace-offering, and he\nstood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in\nthe Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and\nhe was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,\nwhen imaginative young men find significance in trifles, and food for\nromance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny\nred rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like\nthat from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the\nsort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and,\nfor a moment, he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself; but the\nnext instant his American common-sense got the better of sentimentality,\nand he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard since he came.\"It's good advice; you'd better take it and save your fingers,\" she\nsaid, thinking her speech amused him.\"Thank you, I will,\" he answered in jest, and a few months later he did\nit in earnest.\"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?\" she asked presently,\nas she settled herself on a rustic seat.\"Very soon.\"\"You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.\"\"I dare say; short answers save trouble.\"\"He expects you, and you really ought to go.\"\"Hospitable creature! I know it.\"\"Then why don't you do it?\"\"Natural depravity, I suppose.\"\"Natural indolence, you mean. It's really dreadful!\" and Amy looked\nsevere.\"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I\nmight as well stay, and plague you a little longer, you can bear it\nbetter; in fact, I think it agrees with you excellently;\" and Laurie\ncomposed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.Amy shook her head, and opened her sketch-book with an air of\nresignation; but she had made up her mind to lecture \"that boy,\" and in\na minute she began again.\"What are you doing just now?\"\"Watching lizards.\"\"No, no; I mean what do you intend and wish to do?\"\"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me.\"\"How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars, and I will only allow\nit on condition that you let me put you into my sketch; I need a\nfigure.\"\"With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me,--full-length or\nthree-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully suggest a\nrecumbent posture, then put yourself in also, and call it '_Dolce far\nniente._'\"\"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. _I_ intend to work hard,\"\nsaid Amy, in her most energetic tone.\"What delightful enthusiasm!\" and he leaned against a tall urn with an\nair of entire satisfaction.\"What would Jo say if she saw you now?\" asked Amy impatiently, hoping to\nstir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name."

  "content": "\"As usual, 'Go away, Teddy, I'm busy!'\" He laughed as he spoke, but the\nlaugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the\nutterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed\nyet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them\nbefore, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on\nLaurie's face,--a hard, bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and\nregret. It was gone before she could study it, and the listless\nexpression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic\npleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in\nthe sun with uncovered head, and eyes full of southern dreaminess; for\nhe seemed to have forgotten her, and fallen into a reverie.\"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,\" she\nsaid, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark\nstone.\"Wish I was!\"\"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoilt your life. You are so\nchanged, I sometimes think--\" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,\nhalf-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated\nto express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used to\nsay it to her mother,--\"It's all right, ma'am.\"That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry\nher lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the\ncordial tone in which she said,--\"I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I\nfancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost\nyour heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into some\nof the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a\nforeign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun; come and lie on the grass\nhere, and 'let us be friendly,' as Jo used to say when we got in the\nsofa-corner and told secrets.\"[Illustration: Laurie threw himself down on the turf]Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse\nhimself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay\nthere.\"I'm all ready for the secrets;\" and he glanced up with a decided\nexpression of interest in his eyes.\"I've none to tell; you may begin.\"\"Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had some news\nfrom home.\"\"You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often? I\nfancied Jo would send you volumes.\"\"She's very busy; I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,\nyou know. When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?\" he\nasked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he\nhad been wondering if Amy knew his secret, and wanted to talk about it."

  "content": "\"Never,\" she answered, with a despondent but decided air. \"Rome took all\nthe vanity out of me; for after seeing the wonders there, I felt too\ninsignificant to live, and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.\"\"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?\"\"That's just why,--because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy\ncan make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a\ncommon-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more.\"\"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?\"\"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get the\nchance.\"It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring; but audacity becomes\nyoung people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. Laurie smiled,\nbut he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a\nlong-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.\"Good! and here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.\"Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her\ndowncast face, that made Laurie sit up and say gravely,--\"Now I'm going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?\"\"I don't promise to answer.\"\"Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of the world\nenough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred and\nyou last year, and it's my private opinion that, if he had not been\ncalled home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come\nof it--hey?\"\"That's not for me to say,\" was Amy's prim reply; but her lips would\nsmile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye, which betrayed\nthat she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.\"You are not engaged, I hope?\" and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly\nand grave all of a sudden.\"No.\"\"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down upon his\nknees, won't you?\"\"Very likely.\"\"Then you are fond of old Fred?\"\"I could be, if I tried.\"\"But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul, what\nunearthly prudence! He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I fancied\nyou'd like.\""

  "content": "\"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,\" began Amy, trying\nto be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of herself,\nin spite of the sincerity of her intentions.\"I understand; queens of society can't get on without money, so you mean\nto make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right and proper, as\nthe world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother's\ngirls.\"\"True, nevertheless.\"A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered\ncontrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this\ninstinctively, and laid himself down again, with a sense of\ndisappointment which he could not explain. His look and silence, as well\nas a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her resolve\nto deliver her lecture without delay.\"I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,\" she said\nsharply.\"Do it for me, there's a dear girl.\"\"I could, if I tried;\" and she looked as if she would like doing it in\nthe most summary style.\"Try, then; I give you leave,\" returned Laurie, who enjoyed having some\none to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.\"You'd be angry in five minutes.\"\"I'm never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire: you are\nas cool and soft as snow.\"\"You don't know what I can do; snow produces a glow and a tingle, if\napplied rightly. Your indifference is half affectation, and a good\nstirring up would prove it.\"\"Stir away; it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said\nwhen his little wife beat him. Regard me in the light of a husband or a\ncarpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees\nwith you.\"Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the\napathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and\nbegan:--\"Flo and I have got a new name for you; it's 'Lazy Laurence.' How do you\nlike it?\"She thought it would annoy him; but he only folded his arms under his\nhead, with an imperturbable \"That's not bad. Thank you, ladies.\"\"Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?\"\"Pining to be told.\"\"Well, I despise you.\""

Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing\nbut waste time and money and disappoint your friends.\"\"Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-years grind?\"\"You don't look as if you'd had much; at any rate, you are none the\nbetter for it, as far as I can see. I said, when we first met, that you\nhad improved. Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so nice\nas when I left you at home. You have grown abominably lazy; you like\ngossip, and waste time on frivolous things; you are contented to be\npetted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and respected\nby wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, and beauty,--ah, you\nlike that, Old Vanity! but it's the truth, so I can't help saying\nit,--with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you can find\nnothing to do but dawdle; and, instead of being the man you might and\nought to be, you are only--\" There she stopped, with a look that had\nboth pain and pity in it.\"Saint Laurence on a gridiron,\" added Laurie, blandly finishing the\nsentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a\nwide-awake sparkle in his eyes now, and a half-angry, half-injured\nexpression replaced the former indifference."

You men tell us we are angels, and say we\ncan make you what we will; but the instant we honestly try to do you\ngood, you laugh at us, and won't listen, which proves how much your\nflattery is worth.\" Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the\nexasperating martyr at her feet.In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,\nand Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child,--\"I will be good, oh, I will be good!\"But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest; and, tapping on the\noutspread hand with her pencil, said soberly,--\"Aren't you ashamed of a hand like that? It's as soft and white as a\nwoman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best\ngloves, and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven!\nso I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal-rings on it, only\nthe little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she was\nhere to help me!\"\"So do I!\"The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough in\nthe echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down at him with a\nnew thought in her mind; but he was lying with his hat half over his\nface, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. She only saw his\nchest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and\nthe hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to hide\nsomething too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute\nvarious hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy's mind,\nand told her what her sister never had confided to her. She remembered\nthat Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo; she recalled the shadow on\nhis face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the\nlittle old ring, which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls are\nquick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that\nperhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration, and now she\nwas sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and, when she spoke again, it was\nin a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to\nmake it so."
