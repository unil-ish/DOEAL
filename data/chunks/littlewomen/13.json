Uncle doesn't know ten words, and\n    insists on talking English very loud, as if that would make\n    people understand him. Aunt's pronunciation is old-fashioned,\n    and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good\n    deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do the\n    '_parley vooing_,' as uncle calls it.\"Such delightful times as we are having! sight-seeing from\n    morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay\n    _cafés_, and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy\n    days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures. Jo would turn\n    up her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no\n    soul for art; but _I_ have, and I'm cultivating eye and taste as\n    fast as I can. She would like the relics of great people better,\n    for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and gray coat, his\n    baby's cradle and his old toothbrush; also Marie Antoinette's\n    little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword, and\n    many other interesting things. I'll talk for hours about them\n    when I come, but haven't time to write.\"The Palais Royale is a heavenly place,--so full of _bijouterie_\n    and lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't buy\n    them. Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't allow\n    it. Then the Bois and the Champs Elysées are _très magnifique_.\n    I've seen the imperial family several times,--the emperor an\n    ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed\n    in bad taste, _I_ thought,--purple dress, green hat, and yellow\n    gloves. Little Nap. is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his\n    tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his\n    four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets, and a\n    mounted guard before and behind.[Illustration: I've seen the imperial family several times]\"We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely,\n    though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Père la\n    Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are like small\n    rooms, and, looking in, one sees a table, with images or\n    pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners to sit in\n    when they come to lament. That is so Frenchy."

It is\n    so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there, when too\n    tired with our day's work to go out. Fred is very entertaining,\n    and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever\n    knew,--except Laurie, whose manners are more charming. I wish\n    Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men; however, the Vaughns\n    are very rich, and come of an excellent family, so I won't find\n    fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.\"Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland; and, as we\n    shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty\n    letters. I keep my diary, and try to 'remember correctly and\n    describe clearly all that I see and admire,' as father advised.\n    It is good practice for me, and, with my sketch-book, will give\n    you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.\"Adieu; I embrace you tenderly.                     VOTRE AMIE.\"\"MY DEAR MAMMA,--                                   \"HEIDELBERG.\"Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to tell\n    you what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you\n    will see.\"The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed\n    it with all my might. Get father's old guide-books, and read\n    about it; I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At\n    Coblentz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with\n    whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was\n    a moonlight night, and, about one o'clock, Flo and I were waked\n    by the most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and\n    hid behind the curtains; but sly peeps showed us Fred and the\n    students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing\n    I ever saw,--the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress\n    opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of\n    stone.\"When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them\n    scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and\n    go laughing away,--to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next\n    morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his\n    vest-pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and\n    said I didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him,\n    for he tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again.\n    I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to\n    look like it."

Kate said once she\n    hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her that it would\n    be well for him. Frankfort was delightful; I saw Goethe's house,\n    Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous 'Ariadne.' It was very\n    lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the\n    story better. I didn't like to ask, as every one knew it, or\n    pretended they did.

  "content": "\"Now comes the serious part,--for it happened here, and Fred is\n    just gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite\n    fond of him; I never thought of anything but a travelling\n    friendship, till the serenade night. Since then I've begun to\n    feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily\n    adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven't\n    flirted, mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and\n    have done my very best. I can't help it if people like me; I\n    don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for\n    them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know mother\n    will shake her head, and the girls say, 'Oh, the mercenary\n    little wretch!' but I've made up my mind, and, if Fred asks me,\n    I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him,\n    and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young,\n    clever enough, and very rich,--ever so much richer than the\n    Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I should\n    be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous\n    people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have\n    the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one as it is! A city\n    house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses,\n    but twice as comfortable, and full of solid luxury, such as\n    English people believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've\n    seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and\n    pictures of the country place, with its park, great house,\n    lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should\n    ask! and I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up\n    so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I\n    hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I\n    can help. One of us _must_ marry well; Meg didn't, Jo won't,\n    Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything cosey all round.\n    I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of\n    that; and, though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well,\n    and, in time, I should get fond enough of him if he was very\n    fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I've been turning\n    the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible\n    to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little\n    things showed it; he never goes with Flo, always gets on my side\n    of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we\n    are alone, and frowns at any one else who ventures to speak to\n    me. Yesterday, at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us,\n    and then said something to his friend,--a rakish-looking\n    baron,--about '_ein wonderschönes Blöndchen_,' Fred looked as\n    fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely, it nearly flew\n    off his plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but\n    is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might\n    guess from his bonnie blue eyes."

We had a charming time poking\n    about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the\n    beautiful gardens made by the elector, long ago, for his English\n    wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine;\n    so, while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there\n    trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with\n    scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got\n    into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling\n    through the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band\n    below, and waiting for my lover, like a real story-book girl. I\n    had a feeling that something was going to happen, and I was\n    ready for it. I didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool,\n    and only a little excited.[Illustration: Trying to sketch the gray-stone lion's head on the wall]\"By and by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying\n    through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled that I\n    forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said\n    he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was\n    very ill; so he was going at once, in the night train, and only\n    had time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and\n    disappointed for myself, but only for a minute, because he\n    said, as he shook hands,--and said it in a way that I could not\n    mistake,--'I shall soon come back; you won't forget me, Amy?'"

I found her crying over the babies the other day. When she\nsings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in\nher face that I don't understand. This isn't like Beth, and it worries\nme.\"\"Have you asked her about it?\"\"I have tried once or twice; but she either evaded my questions, or\nlooked so distressed that I stopped. I never force my children's\nconfidence, and I seldom have to wait for it long.\"Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed\nquite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's; and, after\nsewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said,--\"I think she is growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have\nhopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why, or being able to\nexplain them. Why, mother, Beth's eighteen, but we don't realize it, and\ntreat her like a child, forgetting she's a woman.\"\"So she is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,\" returned her mother,\nwith a sigh and a smile.\"Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of\nworries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one.

A slight incident gave Jo the clue\nto the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the\nrest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she\nand Beth were alone together; yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on\nher sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth's\nwork often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand,\nin a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal\nlandscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic\nblackbird, and a voice called out,--[Illustration: She leaned her head upon her hands]\"All serene! Coming in to-night.\"Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by\ntill his quick tramp died away, then said softly, as if to herself,--\"How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.\""

Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring\nsomething about needing more paper.\"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!\" she said, sitting down in her own\nroom, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had\njust made. \"I never dreamt of such a thing. What _will_ mother say? I\nwonder if he--\" there Jo stopped, and turned scarlet with a sudden\nthought. \"If he shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be. He\nmust; I'll make him!\" and she shook her head threateningly at the\npicture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.\n\"Oh dear, we _are_ growing up with a vengeance. Here's Meg married and a\nmamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love. I'm the only one\nthat has sense enough to keep out of mischief.\" Jo thought intently for\na minute, with her eyes fixed on the picture; then she smoothed out her\nwrinkled forehead, and said, with a decided nod at the face opposite,\n\"No, thank you, sir; you're very charming, but you've no more stability\nthan a weathercock; so you needn't write touching notes, and smile in\nthat insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I won't have\nit.\""

  "content": "Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie, from which she did not wake\ntill the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which\nonly confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked\nwith Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,\nbut so was everybody's; therefore, no one thought of imagining that he\ncared more for her than for the others. Indeed, a general impression had\nprevailed in the family, of late, that \"our boy\" was getting fonder than\never of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject, and\nscolded violently if any one dared to suggest it. If they had known the\nvarious tender passages of the past year, or rather attempts at tender\npassages which had been nipped in the bud, they would have had the\nimmense satisfaction of saying, \"I told you so.\" But Jo hated\n\"philandering,\" and wouldn't allow it, always having a joke or a smile\nready at the least sign of impending danger.When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month;\nbut these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much\namused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope, despair,\nand resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly\nconferences. But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many\nshrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged\noccasionally in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender\nsubject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,\nand gave out that he was going to \"dig,\" intending to graduate in a\nblaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight\nconfidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the\neye; for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred\nimaginary heroes to real ones, because, when tired of them, the former\ncould be shut up in the tin-kitchen till called for, and the latter were\nless manageable."

If she had not\ngot the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in\nthe fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But\nhaving given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at\na great pace; and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course\nof romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual, Beth lay on\nthe sofa, and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all\nsorts of gossip; for she depended on her weekly \"spin,\" and he never\ndisappointed her. But that evening, Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested\non the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she\nlistened with intense interest to an account of some exciting\ncricket-match, though the phrases, \"caught off a tice,\" \"stumped off his\nground,\" and \"the leg hit for three,\" were as intelligible to her as\nSanscrit. She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it, that\nshe saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that he\ndropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a little\nabsent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an assiduity\nthat was really almost tender.\"Who knows? stranger things have happened,\" thought Jo, as she fussed\nabout the room. \"She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make\nlife delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love each\nother. I don't see how he can help it; and I do believe he would if the\nrest of us were out of the way.\"As every one _was_ out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that\nshe ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should she go?\nand burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she sat\ndown to settle that point.Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa,--long, broad,\nwell-cushioned, and low; a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the\ngirls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back, rode\non the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested tired\nheads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young women.\nThey all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always\nbeen Jo's favorite lounging-place. Among the many pillows that adorned\nthe venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly\nhorsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end; this\nrepulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon of\ndefence, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber."

If \"the\nsausage\" as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might\napproach and repose; but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to the man,\nwoman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot to\nbarricade her corner, and had not been in her seat five minutes, before\na massive form appeared beside her, and, with both arms spread over the\nsofa-back, both long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed,\nwith a sigh of satisfaction,--\"Now, _this_ is filling at the price.\"[Illustration: Now, this is filling at the price]\"No slang,\" snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too late,\nthere was no room for it; and, coasting on to the floor, it disappeared\nin a most mysterious manner.\"Come, Jo, don't be thorny.

She's engaged.

Jo knew that \"young Laurence\" was regarded as a\nmost eligible _parti_ by worldly mammas, was much smiled upon by their\ndaughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb\nof him; so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be spoilt,\nand rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in\nmodest girls.

When I lost sight of father's dear old face, I felt a\n    trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an\n    Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less,\n    hadn't diverted my mind; for I amused myself by dropping\n    gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their\n    mouths to roar.\"Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared\n    up likewise, and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.\"Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even\n    in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little\n    sky-parlor--all she had; but there is a stove in it, and a nice\n    table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I\n    like. A fine view and a church-tower opposite atone for the many\n    stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery,\n    where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs.\n    Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty\n    children,--rather spoilt, I fancy, but they took to me after\n    telling them 'The Seven Bad Pigs;' and I've no doubt I shall\n    make a model governess."

The\n    flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting\n    at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber\n    up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod\n    of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at\n    a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a\n    foreign accent,--\"'It goes better so.

When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that\n    evening, she laughed, and said,--\"'That must have been Professor Bhaer; he's always doing things\n    of that sort.'\"Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin; very learned and good, but\n    poor as a church-mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and\n    two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according\n    to the wishes of his sister, who married an American.

Professor Bhaer was\n    there; and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at\n    him. A regular German,--rather stout, with brown hair tumbled\n    all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I\n    ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good,\n    after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes were\n    rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome\n    feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth; yet I liked\n    him, for he had a fine head; his linen was very nice, and he\n    looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat,\n    and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of\n    his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth\n    bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like\n    an old friend. Then he smiled; and when a tap came at the door,\n    called out in a loud, brisk tone,--\"'Herein!'\"I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a\n    child carrying a big book, and stopped to see what was going on.\"'Me wants my Bhaer,' said the mite, slamming down her book, and\n    running to meet him."

One of the girls kept\n    laughing affectedly, and saying 'Now Professor,' in a\n    coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an\n    accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.\"Both seemed to try his patience sorely; for more than once I\n    heard him say emphatically, 'No, no, it is _not_ so; you haf not\n    attend to what I say;' and once there was a loud rap, as if he\n    struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing\n    exclamation, 'Prut! it all goes bad this day.'\"Poor man, I pitied him; and when the girls were gone, took just\n    one more peep, to see if he survived it.
