I wouldn't have you told,\nfor I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I've done\nit,\" said Jo, when she got her breath.\"I never was more staggered in my life. Isn't it fun? Are they boys?\nWhat are you going to name them? Let's have another look. Hold me up,\nJo; for upon my life it's one too many for me,\" returned Laurie,\nregarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland\nlooking at a pair of infantile kittens.\"Boy and girl. Aren't they beauties?\" said the proud papa, beaming upon\nthe little, red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.\"Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?\" and Laurie bent\nlike a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.\"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French\nfashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes and one\nbrown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,\" said wicked Jo.\"I'm afraid they mightn't like it,\" began Laurie, with unusual timidity\nin such matters.\"Of course they will; they are used to it now. Do it this minute, sir!\"\ncommanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.Laurie screwed up his face, and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each\nlittle cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.\"There, I knew they didn't like it! That's the boy; see him kick; he\nhits out with his fists like a good one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch\ninto a man of your own size, will you?\" cried Laurie, delighted with a\npoke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.\"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother and\ngrandmother. We shall call her Daisy, so as not to have two Megs, and I\nsuppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name,\" said\nAmy, with aunt-like interest.\"Name him Demijohn, and call him 'Demi' for short,\" said Laurie.\"Daisy and Demi,--just the thing!

It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you\npride yourself on keeping promises; so be honorable; come and do your\nduty, and then be at peace for another six months.\"At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking; for she was\nmantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself\nbecause she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking\nto be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make\ncalls in her best array, on a warm July day. She hated calls of the\nformal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain,\nbribe, or promise. In the present instance, there was no escape; and\nhaving clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she\nsmelt thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat and\ngloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.\"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don't intend\nto make calls in that state, I hope,\" cried Amy, surveying her with\namazement."

Hold back your shoulders, and carry your hands\neasily, no matter if your gloves do pinch. There's one thing you can do\nwell, Jo, that is, wear a shawl--I can't; but it's very nice to see you,\nand I'm so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one; it's simple, but\nhandsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point\nof my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to\nshow my boots, for my feet _are_ pretty, though my nose isn't.\"\"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,\" said Jo, looking through\nher hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the\ngold hair. \"Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it up,\nplease, ma'am?\"\"Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house; the sweeping style\nsuits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully. You\nhaven't half buttoned one cuff; do it at once. You'll never look\nfinished if you are not careful about the little details, for they make\nup the pleasing whole.\"Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing up\nher cuff; but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as\n\"pretty as picters,\" Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window to\nwatch them."

'Calm, cool, and quiet,'--yes, I think I can promise that.\nI've played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I'll try it\noff. My powers are great, as you shall see; so be easy in your mind, my\nchild.\"Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word; for, during\nthe first call, she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold\ncorrectly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snow-bank, and as\nsilent as a sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her \"charming\nnovel,\" and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera,\nand the fashions; each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a\ndemure \"Yes\" or \"No,\" with the chill on.

Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment\nlike Maud's face, \"icily regular, splendidly null.\"\"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!\" was\nthe unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door\nclosed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall,\nbut Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very\nnaturally laid the blame upon Jo.\"How could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly\ndignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and\nstone. Try to be sociable at the Lambs', gossip as other girls do, and\nbe interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up.\nThey move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to know, and\nI wouldn't fail to make a good impression there for anything.\"\"I'll be agreeable; I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and\nraptures over any trifle you like.

  "content": "Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there\nwas no knowing where she would stop. Amy's face was a study when she saw\nher sister skim into the next drawing-room, kiss all the young ladies\nwith effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and join in the\nchat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken possession\nof by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to hear a long\naccount of Lucretia's last attack, while three delightful young\ngentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush in and\nrescue her. So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who seemed\npossessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the old\nlady. A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to\nhear what was going on; for broken sentences filled her with alarm,\nround eyes and uplifted hands tormented her with curiosity, and frequent\npeals of laughter made her wild to share the fun. One may imagine her\nsuffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation:--\"She rides splendidly,--who taught her?\"\"No one; she used to practise mounting, holding the reins, and sitting\nstraight on an old saddle in a tree. Now she rides anything, for she\ndoesn't know what fear is, and the stable-man lets her have horses\ncheap, because she trains them to carry ladies so well. She has such a\npassion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails she can be a\nhorse-breaker, and get her living so.\"At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the\nimpression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which\nwas her especial aversion. But what could she do? for the old lady was\nin the middle of her story, and long before it was done Jo was off\nagain, making more droll revelations, and committing still more fearful\nblunders.\"Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone,\nand of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that\nyou had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal for\na pleasure party, wasn't it?\"\"Which did she choose?\" asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who enjoyed\nthe subject.\"None of them; she heard of a young horse at the farmhouse over the\nriver, and, though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try,\nbecause he was handsome and spirited. Her struggles were really\npathetic; there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she took\nthe saddle to the horse. My dear creature, she actually rowed it over\nthe river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the utter\namazement of the old man!\"[Illustration: She took the saddle to the horse]\"Did she ride the horse?\"\"Of course she did, and had a capital time. I expected to see her\nbrought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the\nlife of the party.\"\"Well, I call that plucky!\" and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving\nglance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the\ngirl look so red and uncomfortable."

One of\nthe young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to\nthe picnic; and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was\nbought two years ago, must needs answer, with unnecessary frankness,\n\"Oh, Amy painted it; you can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours\nany color we like. It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister.\"\"Isn't that an original idea?\" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.\"That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's\nnothing the child can't do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for\nSallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest\nshade of sky-blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,\"\nadded Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments that\nexasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her\ncard-case at her.\"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,\"\nobserved the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,\nwho did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.Any mention of her \"works\" always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either\ngrew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a _brusque_\nremark, as now. \"Sorry you could find nothing better to read. I write\nthat rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you\ngoing to New York this winter?\"As Miss Lamb had \"enjoyed\" the story, this speech was not exactly\ngrateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake;\nbut, fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was\nfor her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an\nabruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their\nmouths.\"Amy, we _must_ go. _Good_-by, dear; _do_ come and see us; we are\n_pining_ for a visit. I don't dare to ask _you_, Mr. Lamb; but if you\n_should_ come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away.\"Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style\nthat Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong\ndesire to laugh and cry at the same time.\"Didn't I do that well?\" asked Jo, with a satisfied air, as they walked\naway."

  "content": "\"Nothing could have been worse,\" was Amy's crushing reply. \"What\npossessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and\nboots, and all the rest of it?\"\"Why, it's funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it's no\nuse pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and\nhave things as easy and fine as they do.\"\"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our\npoverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven't a bit of proper\npride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak,\"\nsaid Amy despairingly.Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with the\nstiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.\"How shall I behave here?\" she asked, as they approached the third\nmansion.\"Just as you please; I wash my hands of you,\" was Amy's short answer.\"Then I'll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we'll have a\ncomfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance\nhas a bad effect upon my constitution,\" returned Jo gruffly, being\ndisturbed by her failures to suit.An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children\nspeedily soothed her ruffled feelings; and, leaving Amy to entertain the\nhostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted\nherself to the young folks, and found the change refreshing. She\nlistened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and\npoodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that \"Tom Brown was a brick,\"\nregardless of the improper form of praise; and when one lad proposed a\nvisit to his turtle-tank, she went with an alacrity which caused mamma\nto smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left\nin a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bear-like but affectionate, and\ndearer to her than the most faultless _coiffure_ from the hands of an\ninspired Frenchwoman."

Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady who\nwas third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole family\nwith great respect; for, in spite of her American birth and breeding,\nshe possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of\nus,--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set\nthe most democratic nation under the sun in a ferment at the coming of a\nroyal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has\nsomething to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that\nof a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she\ncould, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But\neven the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the\nBritish nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time; and when the\nproper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from\nthis aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping\nthat her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which\nshould bring disgrace upon the name of March.[Illustration: It might have been worse]It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad; for Jo sat on the\ngrass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog\nreposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related\none of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience. One small child was\npoking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating\ngingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her\ngloves. But all were enjoying themselves; and when Jo collected her\ndamaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come\nagain, \"it was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks.\"\"Capital boys, aren't they? I feel quite young and brisk again after\nthat,\" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from\nhabit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.\"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?\" asked Amy, wisely refraining from\nany comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.\"Don't like him; he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father,\nand doesn't speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast,\nand _I_ don't consider him a desirable acquaintance; so I let him\nalone.\"\"You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod; and\njust now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,\nwhose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod and\nthe bow, it would have been right,\" said Amy reprovingly.\"No, it wouldn't,\" returned perverse Jo; \"I neither like, respect, nor\nadmire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece _was_\nthird cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very\nclever; I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he _is_ a\ngentleman in spite of the brown-paper parcels.\"\"It's no use trying to argue with you,\" began Amy.\"Not the least, my dear,\" interrupted Jo; \"so let us look amiable, and\ndrop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply\ngrateful.\""

Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet.\"\"What a good girl you are, Amy!\" said Jo, with a repentant glance from\nher own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and\nspotless still. \"I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to\nplease people as it is for you.

By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of\nseveral years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of\nholding her tongue.\"I don't like favors; they oppress and make me feel like a slave. I'd\nrather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.\"\"Ahem!\" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.\"I told you so,\" said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in the\nair, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.\"Do you speak French, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying her hand on\nAmy's.\"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often\nas I like,\" replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old lady\nto smile affably."

Eyes don't trouble you\nany more, do they?\"\"Not at all, thank you, ma'am. I'm very well, and mean to do great\nthings next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that\njoyful time arrives.\"\"Good girl! You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some day,\" said\nAunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her ball\nfor her.\"Cross-patch, draw the latch,\n         Sit by the fire and spin,\"squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to\npeep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that\nit was impossible to help laughing.\"Most observing bird,\" said the old lady.\"Come and take a walk, my dear?\" cried Polly, hopping toward the\nchina-closet, with a look suggestive of lump-sugar.\"Thank you, I will. Come, Amy;\" and Jo brought the visit to an end,\nfeeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon\nher constitution. She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy\nkissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the\nimpression of shadow and sunshine; which impression caused Aunt March to\nsay, as they vanished,--\"You'd better do it, Mary; I'll supply the money,\" and Aunt Carrol to\nreply decidedly, \"I certainly will, if her father and mother consent.\"[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: You shall have another table]XXX.CONSEQUENCES."

  "content": "Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was\nconsidered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be\ninvited to take a table, and every one was much interested in the\nmatter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all\nparties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life,\nand it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily.\nThe \"haughty, uninteresting creature\" was let severely alone; but Amy's\ntalent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art-table,\nand she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable\ncontributions to it.Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened; then\nthere occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost\nimpossible to avoid, when some five and twenty women, old and young,\nwith all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater\nfavorite than herself, and, just at this time, several trifling\ncircumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's dainty pen-and-ink\nwork entirely eclipsed May's painted vases,--that was one thorn; then\nthe all-conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy, at a late\nparty, and only once with May,--that was thorn number two; but the chief\ngrievance that rankled in her soul, and gave her an excuse for her\nunfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered\nto her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'. All the\nblame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had\nbeen too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had\npermitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits,\nhowever, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before\nthe fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs.\nChester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter,\nsaid, in a bland tone, but with a cold look,--\"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about\nmy giving this table to any one but my girls. As this is the most\nprominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are\nthe chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take\nthis place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in\nthe cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have\nanother table if you like.\""

Wouldn't you like the flower-table? The\nlittle girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a\ncharming thing of it, and the flower-table is always attractive, you\nknow.\"\"Especially to gentlemen,\" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy\nas to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She colored angrily, but\ntook no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered, with\nunexpected amiability,--\"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I'll give up my place here at\nonce, and attend to the flowers, if you like.\"\"You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,\" began\nMay, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty\nracks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so carefully\nmade and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook\nher meaning, and said quickly,--\"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way;\" and sweeping her contributions\ninto her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her\nworks of art had been insulted past forgiveness.\"Now she's mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak, mamma,\"\nsaid May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.\"Girls' quarrels are soon over,\" returned her mother, feeling a trifle\nashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might."

But\neverything seemed against her: it was late, and she was tired; every one\nwas too busy with their own affairs to help her; and the little girls\nwere only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many\nmagpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to\npreserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm\nafter she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her\nhead when the hanging baskets were filled; her best tile got a splash of\nwater, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's cheek; she bruised her\nhands with hammering, and got cold working in a draught, which last\naffliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl-reader\nwho has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy, and\nwish her well through with her task.There was great indignation at home when she told her story that\nevening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done\nright; Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all; and Jo demanded\nwhy she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to\nget on without her.\"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things,\nand though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to show it.\nThey will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions, won't\nthey, Marmee?\"\"That's the right spirit, my dear; a kiss for a blow is always best,\nthough it's not very easy to give it sometimes,\" said her mother, with\nthe air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and\npractising.In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,\nAmy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her\nenemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came\nto her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table\nthat morning, while the little girls were in an ante-room filling the\nbaskets, she took up her pet production,--a little book, the antique\ncover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which,\non leaves of vellum, she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As\nshe turned the pages, rich in dainty devices, with very pardonable\npride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed\nin a brilliant scroll-work of scarlet, blue, and gold, with little\nspirits of good-will helping one another up and down among the thorns\nand flowers, were the words, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\""

  "content": "\"I ought, but I don't,\" thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright\npage to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not\nhide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a minute,\nturning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for\nall heart-burnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true\nsermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street,\nschool, office, or home; even a fair-table may become a pulpit, if it\ncan offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season.\nAmy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and\nthere; and she did what many of us do not always do,--took the sermon to\nheart, and straightway put it in practice.A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty\nthings, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their\nvoices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the\nstory, and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit\nhad come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She\nheard May say sorrowfully,--\"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't\nwant to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then:\nnow it's spoilt.\"\"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her,\" suggested some one.\"How could I after all the fuss?\" began May, but she did not finish, for\nAmy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly,--\"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was\njust thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your table\nrather than mine. Here they are; please take them, and forgive me if I\nwas hasty in carrying them away last night.\"As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and\nhurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing\nthan it was to stay and be thanked for it.\"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?\" cried one girl.May's answer was inaudible; but another young lady, whose temper was\nevidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable\nlaugh, \"Very lovely; for she knew she wouldn't sell them at her own\ntable.\"Now, that was hard; when we make little sacrifices we like to have them\nappreciated, at least; and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it,\nfeeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is,--as she\npresently discovered; for her spirits began to rise, and her table to\nblossom under her skilful hands; the girls were very kind, and that one\nlittle act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly."

  "content": "It was a very long day, and a hard one to Amy, as she sat behind her\ntable, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon: few\ncared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long\nbefore night.The art-table _was_ the most attractive in the room; there was a crowd\nabout it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro\nwith important faces and rattling money-boxes. Amy often looked\nwistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy,\ninstead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to\nsome of us; but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious,\nbut very trying; and the thought of being found there in the evening by\nher family, and Laurie and his friends, made it a real martyrdom.She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet\nthat they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no\ncomplaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her\nan extra cordial cup of tea, Beth helped her dress, and made a charming\nlittle wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by getting\nherself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were\nabout to be turned.\"Don't do anything rude, pray, Jo. I won't have any fuss made, so let it\nall pass, and behave yourself,\" begged Amy, as she departed early,\nhoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little\ntable.\"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I\nknow, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and his\nboys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet,\" returned Jo,\nleaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. Presently the familiar tramp\nwas heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.\"Is that my boy?\"\"As sure as this is my girl!\" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm,\nwith the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.\"O Teddy, such doings!\" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.\"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by and by, and I'll be\nhanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down\nbefore her table afterward,\" said Laurie, espousing her cause with\nwarmth."

I told him to.\"\"I didn't know that; he forgot, I suppose; and, as your grandpa was\npoorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.\"\"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking! They are\njust as much yours as mine. Don't we always go halves in everything?\"\nbegan Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.\"Gracious, I hope not! half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at\nall. But we mustn't stand philandering here; I've got to help Amy, so\nyou go and make yourself splendid; and if you'll be so very kind as to\nlet Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you\nforever.\"\"Couldn't you do it now?\" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut the\ngate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the bars,\n\"Go away, Teddy; I'm busy.\"Thanks to the conspirators, the tables _were_ turned that night; for\nHayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a lovely basket, arranged in\nhis best manner, for a centre-piece; then the March family turned out\n_en masse_, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only\ncame, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and\napparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his friends\ngallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,\nencamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in\nthe room. Amy was in her element now, and, out of gratitude, if nothing\nmore, was as sprightly and gracious as possible,--coming to the\nconclusion, about that time, that virtue _was_ its own reward, after\nall.[Illustration: Bought up the bouquets]"

As she passed the art-table, she\nglanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no signs of them.\n\"Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,\" thought Jo, who could forgive\nher own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered to her family.\"Good evening, Miss Jo.
