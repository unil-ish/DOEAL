One of\nthe young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to\nthe picnic; and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was\nbought two years ago, must needs answer, with unnecessary frankness,\n\"Oh, Amy painted it; you can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours\nany color we like. It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister.\"\"Isn't that an original idea?\" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.\"That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's\nnothing the child can't do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for\nSallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest\nshade of sky-blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,\"\nadded Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments that\nexasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her\ncard-case at her.\"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,\"\nobserved the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,\nwho did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.Any mention of her \"works\" always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either\ngrew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a _brusque_\nremark, as now. \"Sorry you could find nothing better to read. I write\nthat rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you\ngoing to New York this winter?\"As Miss Lamb had \"enjoyed\" the story, this speech was not exactly\ngrateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake;\nbut, fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was\nfor her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an\nabruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their\nmouths.\"Amy, we _must_ go. _Good_-by, dear; _do_ come and see us; we are\n_pining_ for a visit. I don't dare to ask _you_, Mr. Lamb; but if you\n_should_ come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away.\"Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style\nthat Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong\ndesire to laugh and cry at the same time.\"Didn't I do that well?\" asked Jo, with a satisfied air, as they walked\naway."

  "content": "\"Nothing could have been worse,\" was Amy's crushing reply. \"What\npossessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and\nboots, and all the rest of it?\"\"Why, it's funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it's no\nuse pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and\nhave things as easy and fine as they do.\"\"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our\npoverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven't a bit of proper\npride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak,\"\nsaid Amy despairingly.Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with the\nstiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.\"How shall I behave here?\" she asked, as they approached the third\nmansion.\"Just as you please; I wash my hands of you,\" was Amy's short answer.\"Then I'll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we'll have a\ncomfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance\nhas a bad effect upon my constitution,\" returned Jo gruffly, being\ndisturbed by her failures to suit.An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children\nspeedily soothed her ruffled feelings; and, leaving Amy to entertain the\nhostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted\nherself to the young folks, and found the change refreshing. She\nlistened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and\npoodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that \"Tom Brown was a brick,\"\nregardless of the improper form of praise; and when one lad proposed a\nvisit to his turtle-tank, she went with an alacrity which caused mamma\nto smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left\nin a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bear-like but affectionate, and\ndearer to her than the most faultless _coiffure_ from the hands of an\ninspired Frenchwoman."

Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady who\nwas third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole family\nwith great respect; for, in spite of her American birth and breeding,\nshe possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of\nus,--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set\nthe most democratic nation under the sun in a ferment at the coming of a\nroyal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has\nsomething to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that\nof a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she\ncould, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But\neven the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the\nBritish nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time; and when the\nproper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from\nthis aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping\nthat her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which\nshould bring disgrace upon the name of March.[Illustration: It might have been worse]It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad; for Jo sat on the\ngrass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog\nreposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related\none of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience. One small child was\npoking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating\ngingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her\ngloves. But all were enjoying themselves; and when Jo collected her\ndamaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come\nagain, \"it was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks.\"\"Capital boys, aren't they? I feel quite young and brisk again after\nthat,\" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from\nhabit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.\"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?\" asked Amy, wisely refraining from\nany comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.\"Don't like him; he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father,\nand doesn't speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast,\nand _I_ don't consider him a desirable acquaintance; so I let him\nalone.\"\"You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod; and\njust now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,\nwhose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod and\nthe bow, it would have been right,\" said Amy reprovingly.\"No, it wouldn't,\" returned perverse Jo; \"I neither like, respect, nor\nadmire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece _was_\nthird cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very\nclever; I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he _is_ a\ngentleman in spite of the brown-paper parcels.\"\"It's no use trying to argue with you,\" began Amy.\"Not the least, my dear,\" interrupted Jo; \"so let us look amiable, and\ndrop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply\ngrateful.\""

We can run down\nthere any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the dust in our\nbest bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.\"\"Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt likes to have us pay her the\ncompliment of coming in style, and making a formal call; it's a little\nthing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't believe it will hurt\nyour things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil\nthem. Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet.\"\"What a good girl you are, Amy!\" said Jo, with a repentant glance from\nher own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and\nspotless still. \"I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to\nplease people as it is for you. I think of them, but it takes too much\ntime to do them; so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and let\nthe small ones slip; but they tell best in the end, I fancy.\"Amy smiled, and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,--\"Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones; for they\nhave no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you'd\nremember that, and practise it, you'd be better liked than I am, because\nthere is more of you.\"\"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing to own\nthat you are right; only it's easier for me to risk my life for a person\nthan to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it. It's a great\nmisfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn't it?\"\"It's a greater not to be able to hide them. I don't mind saying that I\ndon't approve of Tudor any more than you do; but I'm not called upon to\ntell him so; neither are you, and there is no use in making yourself\ndisagreeable because he is.\""

  "content": "Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was\nconsidered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be\ninvited to take a table, and every one was much interested in the\nmatter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all\nparties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life,\nand it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily.\nThe \"haughty, uninteresting creature\" was let severely alone; but Amy's\ntalent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art-table,\nand she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable\ncontributions to it.Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened; then\nthere occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost\nimpossible to avoid, when some five and twenty women, old and young,\nwith all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater\nfavorite than herself, and, just at this time, several trifling\ncircumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's dainty pen-and-ink\nwork entirely eclipsed May's painted vases,--that was one thorn; then\nthe all-conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy, at a late\nparty, and only once with May,--that was thorn number two; but the chief\ngrievance that rankled in her soul, and gave her an excuse for her\nunfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered\nto her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'. All the\nblame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had\nbeen too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had\npermitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits,\nhowever, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before\nthe fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs.\nChester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter,\nsaid, in a bland tone, but with a cold look,--\"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about\nmy giving this table to any one but my girls. As this is the most\nprominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are\nthe chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take\nthis place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in\nthe cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have\nanother table if you like.\""

But\neverything seemed against her: it was late, and she was tired; every one\nwas too busy with their own affairs to help her; and the little girls\nwere only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many\nmagpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to\npreserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm\nafter she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her\nhead when the hanging baskets were filled; her best tile got a splash of\nwater, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's cheek; she bruised her\nhands with hammering, and got cold working in a draught, which last\naffliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl-reader\nwho has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy, and\nwish her well through with her task.There was great indignation at home when she told her story that\nevening.

She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came\nto her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table\nthat morning, while the little girls were in an ante-room filling the\nbaskets, she took up her pet production,--a little book, the antique\ncover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which,\non leaves of vellum, she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As\nshe turned the pages, rich in dainty devices, with very pardonable\npride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed\nin a brilliant scroll-work of scarlet, blue, and gold, with little\nspirits of good-will helping one another up and down among the thorns\nand flowers, were the words, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\""

Amy stood a minute,\nturning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for\nall heart-burnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true\nsermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street,\nschool, office, or home; even a fair-table may become a pulpit, if it\ncan offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season.\nAmy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and\nthere; and she did what many of us do not always do,--took the sermon to\nheart, and straightway put it in practice.A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty\nthings, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their\nvoices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the\nstory, and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit\nhad come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She\nheard May say sorrowfully,--\"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't\nwant to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then:\nnow it's spoilt.\"\"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her,\" suggested some one.\"How could I after all the fuss?\" began May, but she did not finish, for\nAmy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly,--\"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was\njust thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your table\nrather than mine. Here they are; please take them, and forgive me if I\nwas hasty in carrying them away last night.\"As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and\nhurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing\nthan it was to stay and be thanked for it.\"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?\" cried one girl.May's answer was inaudible; but another young lady, whose temper was\nevidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable\nlaugh, \"Very lovely; for she knew she wouldn't sell them at her own\ntable.\"Now, that was hard; when we make little sacrifices we like to have them\nappreciated, at least; and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it,\nfeeling that virtue was not always its own reward.

Amy often looked\nwistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy,\ninstead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to\nsome of us; but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious,\nbut very trying; and the thought of being found there in the evening by\nher family, and Laurie and his friends, made it a real martyrdom.She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet\nthat they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no\ncomplaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her\nan extra cordial cup of tea, Beth helped her dress, and made a charming\nlittle wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by getting\nherself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were\nabout to be turned.\"Don't do anything rude, pray, Jo.

She reproached herself for her share of the\nill-feeling, and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible; she also\ndiscovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and\nconsidered her a model of magnanimity. As she passed the art-table, she\nglanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no signs of them.\n\"Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,\" thought Jo, who could forgive\nher own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered to her family.\"Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?\" asked May, with a\nconciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be\ngenerous.\"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is\nenjoying herself. The flower-table is always attractive, you know,\n'especially to gentlemen.'\"Jo _couldn't_ resist giving that little slap, but May took it so meekly\nshe regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising the great vases,\nwhich still remained unsold.\"Is Amy's illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy that for\nfather,\" said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister's work.\"Everything of Amy's sold long ago; I took care that the right people\nsaw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,\" returned\nMay, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy, that\nday.Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news; and Amy looked\nboth touched and surprised by the report of May's words and manner.\"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables\nas generously as you have by mine--especially the art-table,\" she said,\nordering out \"Teddy's Own,\" as the girls called the college friends.\"'Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table; but do your\nduty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of _art_ in every sense\nof the word,\" said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx prepared\nto take the field.\"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,\" said little\nParker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and getting\npromptly quenched by Laurie, who said, \"Very well, my son, for a small\nboy!\" and walked him off, with a paternal pat on the head.\"Buy the vases,\" whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals of\nfire on her enemy's head."

The other gentlemen\nspeculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and\nwandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted\nfans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said\nsomething to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam\nwith satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and\nanxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till\nseveral days later.The fair was pronounced a success; and when May bade Amy good night, she\ndid not \"gush\" as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look\nwhich said, \"Forgive and forget.\" That satisfied Amy; and when she got\nhome she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney-piece, with a\ngreat bouquet in each. \"The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,\" as\nLaurie announced with a flourish.\"You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character\nthan I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved sweetly, and I\nrespect you with all my heart,\" said Jo warmly, as they brushed their\nhair together late that night.\"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It must\nhave been dreadfully hard, after working so long, and setting your heart\non selling your own pretty things. I don't believe I could have done it\nas kindly as you did,\" added Beth from her pillow.\"Why, girls, you needn't praise me so; I only did as I'd be done by. You\nlaugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true\ngentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know\nhow. I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the little\nmeannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. I'm far from\nit now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what mother is.\"Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug,--\"I understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You\nare getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in\ntrue politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away,\ndeary; you'll get your reward some day, and no one will be more\ndelighted than I shall.\""

A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's face was\nilluminated to such a degree, when she read it, that Jo and Beth, who\nwere with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.\"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants--\"\"Me to go with her!\" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an\nuncontrollable rapture.\"No, dear, not you; it's Amy.\"\"O mother! she's too young; it's my turn first. I've wanted it so\nlong--it would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid--I\n_must_ go.\"\"I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is not\nfor us to dictate when she offers such a favor.\"\"It's always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn't\nfair, oh, it isn't fair!\" cried Jo passionately.\"I'm afraid it is partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me the\nother day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit;\nand here she writes, as if quoting something you had said,--'I planned\nat first to ask Jo; but as \"favors burden her,\" and she \"hates French,\"\nI think I won't venture to invite her. Amy is more docile, will make a\ngood companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the trip may\ngive her.'\"\"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! why can't I learn to keep it\nquiet?\" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing. When\nshe had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said\nsorrowfully,--\"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time; so\ntry to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure by reproaches\nor regrets.\"\"I'll try,\" said Jo, winking hard, as she knelt down to pick up the\nbasket she had joyfully upset. \"I'll take a leaf out of her book, and\ntry not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute\nof happiness; but it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful\ndisappointment;\" and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held\nwith several very bitter tears."

The young lady herself received the\nnews as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,\nand began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving\nsuch trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in\nvisions of art than herself.\"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,\" she said impressively, as\nshe scraped her best palette. \"It will decide my career; for if I have\nany genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove\nit.\"\"Suppose you haven't?\" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new\ncollars which were to be handed over to Amy.\"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,\" replied the\naspirant for fame, with philosophic composure; but she made a wry face\nat the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on\nvigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.\"No, you won't; you hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man, and\ncome home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,\" said Jo.\"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one\nwill. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I\nshould like to be able to help those who are,\" said Amy, smiling, as if\nthe part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor\ndrawing-teacher.\"Hum!\" said Jo, with a sigh; \"if you wish it you'll have it, for your\nwishes are always granted--mine never.\"\"Would you like to go?\" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with\nher knife.\"Rather!\"\"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum\nfor relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times.\"\"Thank you; I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes,\nif it ever does,\" returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer\nas gratefully as she could."

Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the\nsteamer sailed; then, just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it\nsuddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her\nand those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last\nlingerer, saying with a sob,--\"Oh, take care of them for me; and if anything should happen--\"\"I will, dear, I will; and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort\nyou,\" whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to\nkeep his word.So Amy sailed away to find the old world, which is always new and\nbeautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from\nthe shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall\nthe happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see\nnothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Flo and I ordered a hansom-cab]XXXI.OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.\"LONDON.\n    \"DEAREST PEOPLE,--\"Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,\n    Piccadilly.

I wish Beth could\n    have come, it would have done her so much good; as for Jo, she\n    would have gone up and sat on the main-top jib, or whatever the\n    high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and\n    tooted on the captain's speaking-trumpet, she'd have been in\n    such a state of rapture.\"It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and\n    found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here\n    and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's\n    country-seats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It\n    was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to see\n    it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore _so_\n    picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead.

The farmhouses were my delight; with thatched roofs,\n    ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy\n    children at the doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than\n    ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a\n    contented cluck, as if they never got nervous, like Yankee\n    biddies. Such perfect color I never saw,--the grass so green,\n    sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark,--I was in a rapture\n    all the way. So was Flo; and we kept bouncing from one side to\n    the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along\n    at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Aunt was tired and went to\n    sleep, but uncle read his guide-book, and wouldn't be astonished\n    at anything. This is the way we went on: Amy, flying up,--'Oh,\n    that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!' Flo,\n    darting to my window,--'How sweet! We must go there some time,\n    won't we, papa?' Uncle, calmly admiring his boots,--'No, my\n    dear, not unless you want beer; that's a brewery.'\"A pause,--then Flo cried out, 'Bless me, there's a gallows and\n    a man going up.' 'Where, where?' shrieks Amy, staring out at two\n    tall posts with a cross-beam and some dangling chains. 'A\n    colliery,' remarks uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. 'Here's a\n    lovely flock of lambs all lying down,' says Amy. 'See, papa,\n    aren't they pretty!' added Flo sentimentally. 'Geese, young\n    ladies,' returns uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo\n    settles down to enjoy 'The Flirtations of Capt. Cavendish,' and\n    I have the scenery all to myself.\"Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was\n    nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested, unpacked,\n    and shopped a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some\n    new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready.\n    A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the\n    loveliest mantle you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is\n    perfectly splendid; things seem so cheap--nice ribbons only\n    sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in\n    Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?\"Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while aunt\n    and uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned\n    afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in\n    them alone. It was so droll! for when we were shut in by the\n    wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and\n    told me to stop him. But he was up outside behind somewhere, and\n    I couldn't get at him. He didn't hear me call, nor see me flap\n    my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling\n    away, and whirling around corners at a break-neck pace. At last,\n    in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on poking it\n    open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said,--\"'Now then, mum?'"

The Duke of Devonshire lives\n    near. I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate; and the\n    Duke of Wellington's house is not far off. Such sights as I saw,\n    my dear! It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers\n    rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous\n    Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and\n    powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with the rosiest\n    children I ever saw; handsome girls, looking half asleep;\n    dandies, in queer English hats and lavender kids, lounging\n    about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps\n    stuck on one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch them.\"Rotten Row means '_Route de Roi_,' or the king's way; but now\n    it's more like a riding-school than anything else.

I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they\n    trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant habits and high\n    hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah's Ark. Every one\n    rides,--old men, stout ladies, little children,--and the young\n    folks do a deal of flirting here; I saw a pair exchange\n    rosebuds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole, and\n    I thought it rather a nice little idea.\"In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey; but don't expect me to\n    describe it, that's impossible--so I'll only say it was sublime!\n    This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an\n    appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.\"MIDNIGHT."
