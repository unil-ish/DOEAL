  "content": "While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home; but\nthe letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and when the\nnext found her, the grass was green above her sister. The sad news met\nher at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they\nhad travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian\nlakes. She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the family decree\nthat she should not shorten her visit, for, since it was too late to say\ngood-by to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow.\nBut her heart was very heavy; she longed to be at home, and every day\nlooked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort\nher.He did come very soon; for the same mail brought letters to them both,\nbut he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him. The moment he\nread it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow-pedestrians,\nand was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow,\nhope and suspense.He knew Vevay well; and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he\nhurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living _en\npension_. The _gar√ßon_ was in despair that the whole family had gone to\ntake a promenade on the lake; but no, the blond mademoiselle might be in\nthe chateau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting\ndown, a flash of time should present her. But monsieur could not wait\neven \"a flash of time,\" and, in the middle of the speech, departed to\nfind mademoiselle himself."

  "content": "A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts\nrustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the\ntower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide, low\nwall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console\nherself with the beauty all about her. She was sitting here that day,\nleaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes,\nthinking of Beth, and wondering why Laurie did not come. She did not\nhear him cross the court-yard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway\nthat led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute,\nlooking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen\nbefore,--the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely\nsuggested love and sorrow,--the blotted letters in her lap, the black\nribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face;\neven the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for\nhe had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had\nany doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set at\nrest the minute she looked up and saw him; for, dropping everything, she\nran to him, exclaiming, in a tone of unmistakable love and longing,--\"O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!\"[Illustration: O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come]I think everything was said and settled then; for, as they stood\ntogether quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down\nprotectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and\nsustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only\nwoman in the world who could fill Jo's place, and make him happy. He did\nnot tell her so; but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth,\nwere satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.In a minute Amy went back to her place; and, while she dried her tears,\nLaurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry\nwell-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future. As\nhe sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the\nrecollection of her impulsive greeting.\"I couldn't help it; I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to\nsee you. It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was\nbeginning to fear you wouldn't come,\" she said, trying in vain to speak\nquite naturally.\"I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to comfort you\nfor the loss of dear little Beth; but I can only feel, and--\" He could\nnot get any further, for he, too, turned bashful all of a sudden, and\ndid not quite know what to say. He longed to lay Amy's head down on his\nshoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare; so took\nher hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than\nwords.\"You needn't say anything; this comforts me,\" she said softly. \"Beth is\nwell and happy, and I mustn't wish her back; but I dread the going home,\nmuch as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for it makes\nme cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay. You needn't go right\nback, need you?\"\"Not if you want me, dear.\""

  "content": "\"I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind; but you seem like one of the\nfamily, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while.\"Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child, whose heart was full,\nthat Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what\nshe wanted,--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation\nshe needed.\"Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half-sick! I'm\ngoing to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk\nabout with me; the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,\" he said, in\nthe half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on\nher hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the\nsunny walk, under the new-leaved chestnuts. He felt more at ease upon\nhis legs; and Amy found it very pleasant to have a strong arm to lean\nupon, a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk\ndelightfully for her alone.The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed\nexpressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but\nthe tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of\ntheir words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this new pair walked\nand talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which\ngave such a charm to time and place; and when an unromantic dinner-bell\nwarned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and\nsorrow behind her in the chateau garden.The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated\nwith a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, \"Now I understand it\nall,--the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my heart, I\nnever thought of such a thing!\"With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed\nno sign of enlightenment; but cordially urged Laurie to stay, and begged\nAmy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much\nsolitude. Amy was a model of docility; and, as her aunt was a good deal\noccupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it with\nmore than her usual success."

  "content": "At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded; at Vevay, Laurie was\nnever idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying, in the\nmost energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did, and followed\nhis example as far and as fast as she could. He said the change was\nowing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a\nlike excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked\nwholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get clearer\nviews of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills; the fresh\nwinds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists;\nthe warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas, tender\nhopes, and happy thoughts; the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of\nthe past, and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them,\nsaying, \"Little children, love one another.\"In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that\nLaurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him a little\nwhile to recover from his surprise at the rapid cure of his first, and,\nas he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled himself\nfor the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost\nthe same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been\nimpossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His\nfirst wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon\nit as if through a long vista of years, with a feeling of compassion\nblended with regret. He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of\nthe bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be grateful\nwhen the pain was over. His second wooing he resolved should be as calm\nand simple as possible; there was no need of having a scene, hardly any\nneed of telling Amy that he loved her; she knew it without words, and\nhad given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that\nno one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, even\nJo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be\nwary and slow in making a second trial; so Laurie let the days pass,\nenjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word\nthat would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance."

  "content": "He had rather imagined that the _d√©nouement_ would take place in the\nchateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous\nmanner; but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was\nsettled on the lake, at noonday, in a few blunt words. They had been\nfloating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny\nMontreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the\nDent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon\nthe hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake\nbelow, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged\ngulls.They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of\nRousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his \"H√©loise.\"\nNeither had read it, but they knew it was a love-story, and each\nprivately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had\nbeen dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell\nbetween them, and, when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars,\nwith an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for the\nsake of saying something,--\"You must be tired; rest a little, and let me row; it will do me good;\nfor, since you came, I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.\"\"I'm not tired; but you may take an oar, if you like. There's room\nenough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't\ntrim,\" returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered third\nof a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar. She rowed\nas well as she did many other things; and, though she used both hands,\nand Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went smoothly\nthrough the water.[Illustration: How well we pull together]\"How well we pull together, don't we?\" said Amy, who objected to silence\njust then.\"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,\nAmy?\" very tenderly.\"Yes, Laurie,\" very low.Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little\n_tableau_ of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected\nin the lake.XLII.ALL ALONE."

  "content": "It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in\nanother, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example; but when\nthe helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved\npresence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo\nfound her promise very hard to keep. How could she \"comfort father and\nmother,\" when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her\nsister; how could she \"make the house cheerful,\" when all its light and\nwarmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home\nfor the new; and where in all the world could she \"find some useful,\nhappy work to do,\" that would take the place of the loving service which\nhad been its own reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her\nduty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust\nthat her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life\nget harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all\nsunshine, and some all shadow; it was not fair, for she tried more than\nAmy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble,\nand hard work.Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came\nover her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,\ndevoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never\nseemed to grow any easier. \"I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a life\nlike this, and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if\nsomebody don't come and help me,\" she said to herself, when her first\nefforts failed, and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind\nwhich often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.But some one did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good\nangels at once, because they wore familiar shapes, and used the simple\nspells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started up at night,\nthinking Beth called her; and when the sight of the little empty bed\nmade her cry with the bitter cry of an unsubmissive sorrow, \"O Beth,\ncome back! come back!\" she did not stretch out her yearning arms in\nvain; for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her\nsister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with\nwords only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears\nthat were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken\nwhispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went\nhand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to\nheart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,\nwhich chastened grief and strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo's burden\nseemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more\nendurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms.When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found\nhelp; for one day she went to the study, and, leaning over the good gray\nhead lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said, very\nhumbly,--\"Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she did, for\nI'm all wrong.\""

  "content": "\"My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,\" he answered, with a falter\nin his voice, and both arms round her, as if he, too, needed help, and\ndid not fear to ask it.[Illustration: Jo and her father]Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told her\ntroubles,--the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that\ndiscouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all\nthe sad bewilderment which we call despair. She gave him entire\nconfidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation\nin the act; for the time had come when they could talk together not only\nas father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve\neach other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. Happy,\nthoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called \"the church of\none member,\" and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered\ncheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit; for the parents who had\ntaught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach\nanother to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its\nbeautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.Other helps had Jo,--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would\nnot be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to\nsee and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as\nthey once had been, for Beth had presided over both; and something of\nher housewifely spirit seemed to linger round the little mop and the old\nbrush, that was never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found herself\nhumming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and\ngiving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and\ncosey, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she\ndidn't know it, till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the\nhand,--\"You thoughtful creter, you're determined we sha'n't miss that dear lamb\nef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see it, and the Lord will\nbless you for't, see ef He don't.\""

I wonder if I should blossom\nout half as well as you have, if I tried it?\" said Jo, as she\nconstructed a kite for Demi, in the topsy-turvy nursery.\"It's just what you need to bring out the tender, womanly half of your\nnature, Jo. You are like a chestnut-burr, prickly outside, but\nsilky-soft within, and a sweet kernel, if one can only get at it. Love\nwill make you show your heart some day, and then the rough burr will\nfall off.\"\"Frost opens chestnut-burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to bring\nthem down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by them,\"\nreturned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would\never carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, but\nshe felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her\npower; and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of\nMeg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.\nGrief is the best opener for some hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for\nthe bag: a little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's\nimpatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the\nburr, and find the kernel sound and sweet. If she had suspected this,\nshe would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever;\nfortunately she wasn't thinking about herself, so, when the time came,\ndown she dropped."

But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine; she was only a struggling\nhuman girl, like hundreds of others, and she just acted out her nature,\nbeing sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood suggested. It's\nhighly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once,\nand it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together,\nbefore some of us even get our feet set in the right way. Jo had got so\nfar, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did\nnot; but to do it cheerfully--ah, that was another thing! She had often\nsaid she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard; and now\nshe had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to devote her\nlife to father and mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they\nhad to her? And, if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor\nof the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than\nto give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for\nothers?Providence had taken her at her word; here was the task, not what she\nhad expected, but better, because self had no part in it: now, could she\ndo it? She decided that she would try; and, in her first attempt, she\nfound the helps I have suggested. Still another was given her, and she\ntook it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the\nrefreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed\nthe hill called Difficulty.\"Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy,\" said her\nmother, once, when the desponding fit overshadowed Jo.\"I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things.\"\"We do; write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world.\nTry it, dear; I'm sure it would do you good, and please us very much.\"\"Don't believe I can;\" but Jo got out her desk, and began to overhaul\nher half-finished manuscripts.An hour afterward her mother peeped in, and there she was, scratching\naway, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which\ncaused Mrs. March to smile, and slip away, well pleased with the success\nof her suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something got into\nthat story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it; for,\nwhen her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it, much\nagainst her will, to one of the popular magazines, and, to her utter\nsurprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested. Letters from\nseveral persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the\nlittle story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends\nadmired it. For a small thing it was a great success; and Jo was more\nastonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.\"I don't understand it. What _can_ there be in a simple little story\nlike that, to make people praise it so?\" she said, quite bewildered."

Do your best, and grow as happy as we\nare in your success.\"\"If there _is_ anything good or true in what I write, it isn't mine; I\nowe it all to you and mother and to Beth,\" said Jo, more touched by her\nfather's words than by any amount of praise from the world.So, taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent\nthem away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very\ncharitable world to such humble wanderers; for they were kindly\nwelcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful\nchildren whom good fortune overtakes.When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that Jo\nwould find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon set\nat rest; for, though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very quietly,\nand was full of hopes and plans for \"the children\" before she read the\nletter twice. It was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the\nother in lover-like fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to\nthink of, for no one had any objection to make.\"You like it, mother?\" said Jo, as they laid down the closely written\nsheets, and looked at one another.\"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused\nFred.

You never said a word to\nme.\"\"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have\ngirls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your head, lest\nyou should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled.\"\"I'm not the scatter-brain I was; you may trust me, I'm sober and\nsensible enough for any one's _confidante_ now.\"\"So you are, dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied it\nmight pain you to learn that your Teddy loved any one else.\""

But you are right in one thing: I _am_ lonely, and perhaps if Teddy\nhad tried again, I might have said 'Yes,' not because I love him any\nmore, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away.\"\"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are\nplenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with father and mother,\nsisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all\ncomes to give you your reward.\"\"Mothers are the _best_ lovers in the world; but I don't mind whispering\nto Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds.

I never knew how good and generous and tender\nhe was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it full of\nnoble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it's\nmine.

A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again,\nnot bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one\nsister should have all she asked, the other nothing. It was not true;\nshe knew that, and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for\naffection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry longing for\nsome one to \"love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them\nbe together.\"Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended, stood four little\nwooden chests in a row, each marked with its owner's name, and each\nfilled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all. Jo\nglanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the\nedge, and stared absently at the chaotic collection, till a bundle of\nold exercise-books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them over,\nand re-lived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's. She had smiled\nat first, then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a\nlittle message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began to\ntremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the\nfriendly words, as if they took a new meaning, and touched a tender spot\nin her heart.\"Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely\ncome.\"\"Oh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always; my\ndear old Fritz, I didn't value him half enough when I had him, but now\nhow I should love to see him, for every one seems going away from me,\nand I'm all alone.\""

It was her favorite way of spending the hour of\ndusk; no one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little\nred pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender\nthoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her face looked tired,\ngrave, and rather sad; for to-morrow was her birthday, and she was\nthinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how\nlittle she seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and nothing\nto show for it. Jo was mistaken in that; there was a good deal to show,\nand by and by she saw, and was grateful for it.\"An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for\na spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a\nmorsel of fame, perhaps; when, like poor Johnson, I'm old, and can't\nenjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.\nWell, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner; and, I dare say,\nold maids are very comfortable when they get used to it; but--\" and\nthere Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting."

At\ntwenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly\nresolve that they never will be; at thirty they say nothing about it,\nbut quietly accept the fact, and, if sensible, console themselves by\nremembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which\nthey may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don't laugh at the\nspinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragical romances are\nhidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,\nand many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make\nthe faded faces beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour sisters\nshould be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part\nof life, if for no other reason; and, looking at them with compassion,\nnot contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may\nmiss the blossom time; that rosy cheeks don't last forever, that silver\nthreads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by and by,\nkindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter\nhow poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that\nwhich is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,\nand serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect\nthe good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and\npetted, too often without thanks; the scrapes they have helped you out\nof, the \"tips\" they have given you from their small store, the stitches\nthe patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet\nhave taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions\nthat women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls\nare quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them;\nand if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son,\nshould rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and\nmaternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest\ncorner of her lonely old heart for the \"the best nevvy in the world.\"Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this\nlittle homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before\nher,--a substantial, lifelike ghost,--leaning over her, with the very\nlook he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't like to show\nit. But, like Jenny in the ballad,--\"She could not think it he,\"and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and\nkissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully,--\"O my Teddy! O my Teddy!\"\"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?\"\"Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?\"\"Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by the way, and\nthere was no getting my wife out of their clutches.\"\"Your what?\" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an\nunconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him."

What dreadful thing will you do next?\" and Jo fell into\nher seat, with a gasp.\"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,\"\nreturned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with\nsatisfaction.\"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like\na burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you\nridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.\"\"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to\nbarricade.\"Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted\nthe sofa invitingly, as she said, in a cordial tone,--\"The old pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now; so, come and\n'fess, Teddy.\"\"How good it sounds to hear you say 'Teddy'! No one ever calls me that\nbut you;\" and Laurie sat down, with an air of great content.\"What does Amy call you?\"\"My lord.\"\"That's like her. Well, you look it;\" and Jo's eyes plainly betrayed\nthat she found her boy comelier than ever.The pillow was gone, but there _was_ a barricade, nevertheless,--a\nnatural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it,\nand for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast\na little shadow over them. It was gone directly, however, for Laurie\nsaid, with a vain attempt at dignity,--\"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?\"\"Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, but you\nare the same scapegrace as ever.\"\"Now, really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\" began\nLaurie, who enjoyed it all immensely."

I couldn't wait; I wanted to be the one to tell you\nthe grand surprise, and have 'first skim,' as we used to say when we\nsquabbled about the cream.\"\"Of course you did, and spoilt your story by beginning at the wrong end.\nNow, start right, and tell me how it all happened; I'm pining to know.\"\"Well, I did it to please Amy,\" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made\nJo exclaim,--\"Fib number one; Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth, if\nyou can, sir.\"\"Now she's beginning to marm it; isn't it jolly to hear her?\" said\nLaurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite\nagreed. \"It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to\ncome home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly\nchanged their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But\ngrandpa wanted to come home; he went to please me, and I couldn't let\nhim go alone, neither could I leave Amy; and Mrs. Carrol had got English\nnotions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy come\nwith us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be married,\nand then we can do as we like.'\"\"Of course you did; you always have things to suit you.\"\"Not always;\" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily,--\"How did you ever get aunt to agree?\"\"It was hard work; but, between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps\nof good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write and ask leave,\nbut you all liked it, had consented to it by and by, and it was only\n'taking Time by the fetlock,' as my wife says.\"\"Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?\"\ninterrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with\ndelight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so\ntragically gloomy when she saw them last."

As\nI told you in my letter, when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I\nnever shall stop loving you; but the love is altered, and I have learned\nto see that it is better as it is. Amy and you change places in my\nheart, that's all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come\nabout naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me; but I never\ncould be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong\nand violent; and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it\n_was_ one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of\nmyself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that\nI didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love both\nalike; but I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything\nseemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and\nI felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with\nthe new; that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife\nAmy, and love them both dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the\nhappy old times when we first knew one another?\"\"I'll believe it, with all my heart; but, Teddy, we never can be boy and\ngirl again: the happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't expect\nit. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for playtime is\nover, and we must give up frolicking. I'm sure you feel this; I see the\nchange in you, and you'll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I\nshall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be\nwhat I hoped he would. We can't be little playmates any longer, but we\nwill be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives,\nwon't we, Laurie?\"He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his\nface down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish\npassion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them\nboth. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming home\nto be a sad one,--\"I can't make it true that you children are really married, and going to\nset up housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning\nAmy's pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how\ntime does fly!\"\"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so like\na grandma. I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed,' as Peggotty said\nof David; and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a precocious\ninfant,\" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in\nfeeling, Teddy. Women always are; and this last year has been such a\nhard one that I feel forty.\"\"Poor Jo! we left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You\n_are_ older; here's a line, and there's another; unless you smile, your\neyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear\non it. You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.\nWhat a selfish beast I've been!\" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a\nremorseful look."

I _am_ lonely, sometimes, but I dare say\nit's good for me, and--\"\"You never shall be again,\" broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,\nas if to fence out every human ill. \"Amy and I can't get on without\nyou, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep house, and go\nhalves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and all\nbe blissfully happy and friendly together.\"\"If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant.

You look a little wicked now; what is it, grandma?\"\"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.\"\"Like angels!\"\"Yes, of course, at first; but which rules?\"\"I don't mind telling you that she does, now; at least I let her think\nso,--it pleases her, you know. By and by we shall take turns, for\nmarriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties.\"\"You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your\nlife.\"\"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind\nmuch. She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well; in fact, I\nrather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and\nprettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you\na favor all the while.\"\"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying\nit!\" cried Jo, with uplifted hands."
