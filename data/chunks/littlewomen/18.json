  "content": "\"There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret; humor and pathos make it\nalive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote with no thought\nof fame or money, and put your heart into it, my daughter; you have had\nthe bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your best, and grow as happy as we\nare in your success.\"\"If there _is_ anything good or true in what I write, it isn't mine; I\nowe it all to you and mother and to Beth,\" said Jo, more touched by her\nfather's words than by any amount of praise from the world.So, taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent\nthem away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very\ncharitable world to such humble wanderers; for they were kindly\nwelcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful\nchildren whom good fortune overtakes.When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that Jo\nwould find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon set\nat rest; for, though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very quietly,\nand was full of hopes and plans for \"the children\" before she read the\nletter twice. It was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the\nother in lover-like fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to\nthink of, for no one had any objection to make.\"You like it, mother?\" said Jo, as they laid down the closely written\nsheets, and looked at one another.\"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused\nFred. I felt sure then that something better than what you call the\n'mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here and there in her\nletters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day.\"\"How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a word to\nme.\"\"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have\ngirls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your head, lest\nyou should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled.\"\"I'm not the scatter-brain I was; you may trust me, I'm sober and\nsensible enough for any one's _confidante_ now.\"\"So you are, dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied it\nmight pain you to learn that your Teddy loved any one else.\""

  "content": "\"Now, mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish,\nafter I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?\"\"I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he\ncame back, and asked again, you might, perhaps, feel like giving another\nanswer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very lonely,\nand sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart;\nso I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now.\"\"No, mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned to love\nhim. But you are right in one thing: I _am_ lonely, and perhaps if Teddy\nhad tried again, I might have said 'Yes,' not because I love him any\nmore, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away.\"\"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are\nplenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with father and mother,\nsisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all\ncomes to give you your reward.\"\"Mothers are the _best_ lovers in the world; but I don't mind whispering\nto Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very curious, but the\nmore I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the\nmore I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts could take in so many; mine is\nso elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite contented\nwith my family. I don't understand it.\"\"I do;\" and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the\nleaves to read what Amy said of Laurie."

  "content": "\"It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me; he isn't\nsentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he\nsays and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don't seem\nto be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and tender\nhe was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it full of\nnoble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it's\nmine. He says he feels as if he 'could make a prosperous voyage now\nwith me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast.' I pray he may,\nand try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain with all\nmy heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets\nus be together. O mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world\ncould be, when two people love and live for one another!\"\"And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love does work\nmiracles. How very, very happy they must be!\" And Jo laid the rustling\nsheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a\nlovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he\nfinds himself alone in the work-a-day world again.By and by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not\nwalk. A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again,\nnot bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one\nsister should have all she asked, the other nothing. It was not true;\nshe knew that, and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for\naffection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry longing for\nsome one to \"love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them\nbe together.\"Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended, stood four little\nwooden chests in a row, each marked with its owner's name, and each\nfilled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all. Jo\nglanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the\nedge, and stared absently at the chaotic collection, till a bundle of\nold exercise-books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them over,\nand re-lived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's. She had smiled\nat first, then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a\nlittle message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began to\ntremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the\nfriendly words, as if they took a new meaning, and touched a tender spot\nin her heart.\"Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely\ncome.\"\"Oh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always; my\ndear old Fritz, I didn't value him half enough when I had him, but now\nhow I should love to see him, for every one seems going away from me,\nand I'm all alone.\""

It was her favorite way of spending the hour of\ndusk; no one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little\nred pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender\nthoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her face looked tired,\ngrave, and rather sad; for to-morrow was her birthday, and she was\nthinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how\nlittle she seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and nothing\nto show for it. Jo was mistaken in that; there was a good deal to show,\nand by and by she saw, and was grateful for it.\"An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for\na spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a\nmorsel of fame, perhaps; when, like poor Johnson, I'm old, and can't\nenjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.\nWell, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner; and, I dare say,\nold maids are very comfortable when they get used to it; but--\" and\nthere Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting."

At\ntwenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly\nresolve that they never will be; at thirty they say nothing about it,\nbut quietly accept the fact, and, if sensible, console themselves by\nremembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which\nthey may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don't laugh at the\nspinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragical romances are\nhidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,\nand many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make\nthe faded faces beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour sisters\nshould be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part\nof life, if for no other reason; and, looking at them with compassion,\nnot contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may\nmiss the blossom time; that rosy cheeks don't last forever, that silver\nthreads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by and by,\nkindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter\nhow poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that\nwhich is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,\nand serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect\nthe good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and\npetted, too often without thanks; the scrapes they have helped you out\nof, the \"tips\" they have given you from their small store, the stitches\nthe patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet\nhave taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions\nthat women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls\nare quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them;\nand if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son,\nshould rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and\nmaternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest\ncorner of her lonely old heart for the \"the best nevvy in the world.\"Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this\nlittle homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before\nher,--a substantial, lifelike ghost,--leaning over her, with the very\nlook he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't like to show\nit. But, like Jenny in the ballad,--\"She could not think it he,\"and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and\nkissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully,--\"O my Teddy! O my Teddy!\"\"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?\"\"Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?\"\"Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by the way, and\nthere was no getting my wife out of their clutches.\"\"Your what?\" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an\nunconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him."

What dreadful thing will you do next?\" and Jo fell into\nher seat, with a gasp.\"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,\"\nreturned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with\nsatisfaction.\"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like\na burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that?

No one ever calls me that\nbut you;\" and Laurie sat down, with an air of great content.\"What does Amy call you?\"\"My lord.\"\"That's like her. Well, you look it;\" and Jo's eyes plainly betrayed\nthat she found her boy comelier than ever.The pillow was gone, but there _was_ a barricade, nevertheless,--a\nnatural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it,\nand for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast\na little shadow over them. It was gone directly, however, for Laurie\nsaid, with a vain attempt at dignity,--\"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?\"\"Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, but you\nare the same scapegrace as ever.\"\"Now, really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\" began\nLaurie, who enjoyed it all immensely."

I couldn't wait; I wanted to be the one to tell you\nthe grand surprise, and have 'first skim,' as we used to say when we\nsquabbled about the cream.\"\"Of course you did, and spoilt your story by beginning at the wrong end.\nNow, start right, and tell me how it all happened; I'm pining to know.\"\"Well, I did it to please Amy,\" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made\nJo exclaim,--\"Fib number one; Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth, if\nyou can, sir.\"\"Now she's beginning to marm it; isn't it jolly to hear her?\" said\nLaurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite\nagreed. \"It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to\ncome home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly\nchanged their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But\ngrandpa wanted to come home; he went to please me, and I couldn't let\nhim go alone, neither could I leave Amy; and Mrs. Carrol had got English\nnotions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy come\nwith us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be married,\nand then we can do as we like.'\"\"Of course you did; you always have things to suit you.\"\"Not always;\" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily,--\"How did you ever get aunt to agree?\"\"It was hard work; but, between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps\nof good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write and ask leave,\nbut you all liked it, had consented to it by and by, and it was only\n'taking Time by the fetlock,' as my wife says.\"\"Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?\"\ninterrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with\ndelight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so\ntragically gloomy when she saw them last."

As\nI told you in my letter, when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I\nnever shall stop loving you; but the love is altered, and I have learned\nto see that it is better as it is. Amy and you change places in my\nheart, that's all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come\nabout naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me; but I never\ncould be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong\nand violent; and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it\n_was_ one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of\nmyself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that\nI didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love both\nalike; but I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything\nseemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and\nI felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with\nthe new; that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife\nAmy, and love them both dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the\nhappy old times when we first knew one another?\"\"I'll believe it, with all my heart; but, Teddy, we never can be boy and\ngirl again: the happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't expect\nit. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for playtime is\nover, and we must give up frolicking. I'm sure you feel this; I see the\nchange in you, and you'll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I\nshall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be\nwhat I hoped he would. We can't be little playmates any longer, but we\nwill be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives,\nwon't we, Laurie?\"He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his\nface down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish\npassion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them\nboth. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming home\nto be a sad one,--\"I can't make it true that you children are really married, and going to\nset up housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning\nAmy's pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how\ntime does fly!\"\"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so like\na grandma. I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed,' as Peggotty said\nof David; and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a precocious\ninfant,\" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in\nfeeling, Teddy. Women always are; and this last year has been such a\nhard one that I feel forty.\"\"Poor Jo! we left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You\n_are_ older; here's a line, and there's another; unless you smile, your\neyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear\non it.

  "content": "\"I don't care;\" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an\nuncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the party\nvanishing above, and, as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last\nstair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she\nlooked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,\nfor even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift was\ncoming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to\nherself, \"I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed; it won't do to be\ndismal now.\" Then she drew her hand over her eyes,--for one of her\nboyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was,--and had\njust managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the\nporch-door.She opened it with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had\ncome to surprise her; for there stood a tall, bearded gentleman, beaming\non her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\"O Mr. Bhaer, I _am_ so glad to see you!\" cried Jo, with a clutch, as if\nshe feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.[Illustration: O Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you]\"And I to see Miss Marsch,--but no, you haf a party--\" and the Professor\npaused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to\nthem.\"No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have just come\nhome, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us.\"Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously\naway, and come again another day; but how could he, when Jo shut the\ndoor behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had\nsomething to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,\nand showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary\nman, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all. You\nhaf been ill, my friend?\"He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light\nfell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you\nlast.\"\"Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that;\" and he\nshook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no\ncomfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,\nwarm hand.\"Father, mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,\" she said, with a\nface and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as\nwell have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish."

Every one greeted\nhim kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his\nown. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all\nhearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once, feeling even the\nmore friendly because he was poor; for poverty enriches those who live\nabove it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer\nsat looking about him with the air of a traveller who knocks at a\nstrange door, and, when it opens, finds himself at home. The children\nwent to him like bees to a honey-pot; and, establishing themselves on\neach knee, proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling\nhis beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The\nwomen telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling\nthat he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his\nguest's benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but\nsaid not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have\namused her; for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like\nsuspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe\nthe new-comer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.\nHe got interested in spite of himself, and, before he knew it, was drawn\ninto the circle; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,\nand did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him\noften, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own\nlost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eye would\nturn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute\ninquiry if she had seen it; but Jo had her own eyes to take care of,\nand, feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on\nthe little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt."

Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, and\nlooked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and\nhandsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she\nusually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite\ninspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the\nconversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic.\nJo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and\nthought to herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, \"How he\nwould enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!\"\nLastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him\nlook more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and\nsmoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for, in exciting\nmoments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do; and Jo liked\nit rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his\nfine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that\nplain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing\nescape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold\nsleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands!\"Dear old fellow! He couldn't have got himself up with more care if he'd\nbeen going a-wooing,\" said Jo to herself; and then a sudden thought,\nborn of the words, made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her\nball, and go down after it to hide her face.The manœuvre did not succeed as well as she expected, however; for,\nthough just in the act of setting fire to a funeral-pile, the Professor\ndropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the\nlittle blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,\nsaw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to\nresume their seats, wishing they had not left them.Nobody knew where the evening went to; for Hannah skilfully abstracted\nthe babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.\nLaurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking\naway, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal\nmind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of\nbed, and Demi set his night-gown afire studying the structure of\nmatches, made a move to go.\"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together\nagain once more,\" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and\npleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.They were not _all_ there. But no one found the words thoughtless or\nuntrue; for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,\ninvisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the\nhousehold league that love made indissoluble. The little chair stood in\nits old place; the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished\nwhen the needle grew \"so heavy,\" was still on its accustomed shelf; the\nbeloved instrument, seldom touched now, had not been moved; and above it\nBeth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon\nthem, seeming to say, \"Be happy. I am here.\""

Let them hear how much you have improved,\" said\nLaurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool,--\"Not to-night, dear. I can't show off to-night.\"But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill; for she sung\nBeth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master\ncould not have taught, and touched the listeners' hearts with a sweeter\npower than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very\nstill, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth's\nfavorite hymn. It was hard to say,--\"Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;\"and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that\nher welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.\"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song; for Mr. Bhaer sings that,\" said\nJo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with\na gratified \"Hem!\" as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood,\nsaying,--\"You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.\"A pleasing fiction, by the way; for Jo had no more idea of music than a\ngrasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a\nwhole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.\nIt didn't much matter; for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily\nand well; and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen\nto the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.[Illustration: Mr. Bhaer sang heartily]\"Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,\"used to be the Professor's favorite line, for \"das land\" meant Germany\nto him; but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,\nupon the words,--\"There, oh there, might I with thee,\n         O my beloved, go!\"and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she\nlonged to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither\nwhenever he liked."

But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners\nentirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet; for she had been\nintroduced simply as \"my sister,\" and no one had called her by her new\nname since he came. He forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in\nhis most gracious manner, at parting,--\"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that\nthere is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\"Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly\nilluminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most\ndelightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\"I too shall go; but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me\nleave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here\nsome days.\"He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo; and the mother's voice gave\nas cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes; for Mrs. March was not\nso blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.\"I suspect that is a wise man,\" remarked Mr. March, with placid\nsatisfaction, from the hearth-rug, after the last guest had gone.\"I know he is a good one,\" added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as\nshe wound up the clock.\"I thought you'd like him,\" was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her\nbed.She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,\nand finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,\nsomewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen\nhis face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a\nsevere and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to\nbe gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the\nsubject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture\nin the dark.[Illustration: Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap]XLIV.MY LORD AND LADY.\"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour?

Men are _so_ helpless, mother,\" said Amy, with a\nmatronly air, which delighted her husband.\"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?\" asked\nJo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.\"We have our plans; we don't mean to say much about them yet, because we\nare such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle. I'm going into\nbusiness with a devotion that shall delight grandfather, and prove to\nhim that I'm not spoilt. I need something of the sort to keep me steady.\nI'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.\"\"And Amy, what is she going to do?\" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at\nLaurie's decision, and the energy with which he spoke.\"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall\nastonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant\nsociety we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall\nexert over the world at large.

If my memory serves me, you once thought it your\nduty to make a rich match; that accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a\ngood-for-nothing like me.\"\"O my dearest boy, don't, don't say that! I forgot you were rich when I\nsaid 'Yes.' I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I sometimes\nwish you _were_ poor that I might show how much I love you;\" and Amy,\nwho was very dignified in public and very fond in private, gave\nconvincing proofs of the truth of her words.\"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be\nonce, do you?
