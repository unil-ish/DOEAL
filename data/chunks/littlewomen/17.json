  "content": "\"How well you draw!\" he said, with genuine surprise and pleasure at her\nskill, adding, with a half-laugh,--\"Yes, that's me.\"\"As you are: this is as you were;\" and Amy laid another sketch beside\nthe one he held.It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it\nwhich atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that a\nsudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked. Only a rough\nsketch of Laurie taming a horse; hat and coat were off, and every line\nof the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude, was full\nof energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood arching\nhis neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing\nthe ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had\nmastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider's breezy hair and erect\nattitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of\nstrength, courage, and youthful buoyancy, that contrasted sharply with\nthe supine grace of the \"_Dolce far niente_\" sketch. Laurie said\nnothing; but, as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush\nup and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little\nlesson she had given him. That satisfied her; and, without waiting for\nhim to speak, she said, in her sprightly way,--[Illustration: A rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse]\"Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all\nlooked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and\nI sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the\nother day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.\"\"Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I congratulate\nyou. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon Paradise' that five\no'clock is the dinner-hour at your hotel?\""

He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air,\nbut it _was_ an affectation now, for the rousing had been more\nefficacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his\nmanner, and said to herself,--\"Now I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad; if it makes\nhim hate me, I'm sorry; but it's true, and I can't take back a word of\nit.\"They laughed and chatted all the way home; and little Baptiste, up\nbehind, thought that monsieur and mademoiselle were in charming spirits.\nBut both felt ill at ease; the friendly frankness was disturbed, the\nsunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gayety, there\nwas a secret discontent in the heart of each.\"Shall we see you this evening, _mon fr√®re_?\" asked Amy as they parted\nat her aunt's door.\"Unfortunately I have an engagement. _Au revoir, mademoiselle_,\" and\nLaurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became\nhim better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and\nwarmly,--\"No; be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd\nrather have a hearty English hand-shake than all the sentimental\nsalutations in France.\"\"Good-by, dear,\" and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,\nLaurie left her, after a hand-shake almost painful in its heartiness.Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made\nher smile at the beginning and sigh at the end:--\"MY DEAR MENTOR,--\"Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself,\n    for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of\n    boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a\n    blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited\n    by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations.\"Yours gratefully,          TELEMACHUS.\"\"Good boy! I'm glad he's gone,\" said Amy, with an approving smile; the\nnext minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding,\nwith an involuntary sigh,--\"Yes, I _am_ glad, but how I shall miss him!\"[Illustration: The Valley of the Shadow]XL.THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW."

  "content": "When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,\nand tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased\naffection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of\ntrouble. They put away their grief, and each did his or her part toward\nmaking that last year a happy one.The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was\ngathered everything that she most loved,--flowers, pictures, her piano,\nthe little work-table, and the beloved pussies. Father's best books\nfound their way there, mother's easy-chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest\nsketches; and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,\nto make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart a little sum,\nthat he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with\nthe fruit she loved and longed for; old Hannah never wearied of\nconcocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears\nas she worked; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful\nletters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands\nthat know no winter.Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil\nand busy as ever; for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish nature,\nand even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for\nthose who should remain behind. The feeble fingers were never idle, and\none of her pleasures was to make little things for the school-children\ndaily passing to and fro,--to drop a pair of mittens from her window for\na pair of purple hands, a needle-book for some small mother of many\ndolls, pen-wipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pot-hooks,\nscrap-books for picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices,\ntill the reluctant climbers up the ladder of learning found their way\nstrewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as\na sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts\nmiraculously suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had wanted any\nreward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her\nwindow, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which came to\nher, full of blots and gratitude."

  "content": "The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look\nround, and say \"How beautiful this is!\" as they all sat together in her\nsunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and\nsisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from\nthe wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as\napplicable now as when written centuries ago; a little chapel, where a\npaternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying\nto show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation\npossible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of those who\nlistened; for the father's heart was in the minister's religion, and the\nfrequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he\nspoke or read.It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as\npreparation for the sad hours to come; for, by and by, Beth said the\nneedle was \"so heavy,\" and put it down forever; talking wearied her,\nfaces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil\nspirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble\nflesh. Ah me! such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching\nhearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced\nto see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the\nbitter cry, \"Help me, help me!\" and to feel that there was no help. A\nsad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with\ndeath; but both were mercifully brief, and then, the natural rebellion\nover, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck of\nher frail body, Beth's soul grew strong; and, though she said little,\nthose about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim\ncalled was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,\ntrying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed\nthe river.Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said, \"I feel stronger when\nyou are here.\" She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew\nthe fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom\nasked for anything, and \"tried not to be a trouble.\" All day she haunted\nthe room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then\nthan of any honor her life ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours\nto Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it needed; lessons\nin patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn\nthem; charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly\nforget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and\nthe sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly."

  "content": "Often, when she woke, Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little\nbook, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw\nher lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the\ntransparent fingers; and Jo would lie watching her, with thoughts too\ndeep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was\ntrying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the\nlife to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music\nshe loved so well.Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest\nhymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter; for, with\neyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest\nsorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life,--uneventful,\nunambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which \"smell sweet, and\nblossom in the dust,\" the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on\nearth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible\nto all.One night, when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find\nsomething to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as\nhard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite\nPilgrim's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's\nhand. The name caught her eye, and the blurred look of the lines made\nher sure that tears had fallen on it.\"Poor Jo! she's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave; she shows\nme all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at this,\"\nthought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug, with the\ntongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.\"MY BETH.\"Sitting patient in the shadow\n           Till the blessed light shall come,\n         A serene and saintly presence\n           Sanctifies our troubled home.\n         Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows\n           Break like ripples on the strand\n         Of the deep and solemn river\n           Where her willing feet now stand.\"O my sister, passing from me,\n           Out of human care and strife,\n         Leave me, as a gift, those virtues\n           Which have beautified your life.\n         Dear, bequeath me that great patience\n           Which has power to sustain\n         A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit\n           In its prison-house of pain."

As she sat with the paper folded between her hands, the\ncharred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze, and crept to\nthe bedside, hoping Beth slept.\"Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it; I knew\nyou wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?\" she asked, with\nwistful, humble earnestness.\"O Beth, so much, so much!\" and Jo's head went down upon the pillow,\nbeside her sister's.\"Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good as you make\nme, but I _have_ tried to do right; and now, when it's too late to\nbegin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that some one loves\nme so much, and feels as if I'd helped them.\"\"More than any one in the world, Beth.

They\nwill turn to you, don't fail them; and if it's hard to work alone,\nremember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing\nthat than writing splendid books or seeing all the world; for love is\nthe only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the\nend so easy.\"\"I'll try, Beth;\" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,\npledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of\nother desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the\nimmortality of love.So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth\ngreener, the flowers were up fair and early, and the birds came back in\ntime to say good-by to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, clung\nto the hands that had led her all her life, as father and mother guided\nher tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up to God.Seldom, except in books, do the dying utter memorable words, see\nvisions, or depart with beatified countenances; and those who have sped\nmany parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and\nsimply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the \"tide went out easily;\" and in\nthe dark hour before the dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her\nfirst breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving\nlook, one little sigh.With tears and prayers and tender hands, mother and sisters made her\nready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with\ngrateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic\npatience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling, with reverent\njoy, that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom\nfull of dread.When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,\nJo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird sang\nblithely on a budding bough, close by, the snow-drops blossomed freshly\nat the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction\nover the placid face upon the pillow,--a face so full of painless peace\nthat those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked God\nthat Beth was well at last.[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Sat staring up at the busts]XLI.LEARNING TO FORGET."

Laurie went back to\nhis grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the\nold gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully,\nand he had better try it again. There was nothing the young gentleman\nwould have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back\nafter the scolding he had received; pride forbid, and whenever the\nlonging grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating the\nwords that had made the deepest impression, \"I despise you;\" \"Go and do\nsomething splendid that will _make_ her love you.\"Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought\nhimself to confess that he _had_ been selfish and lazy; but then when a\nman has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries\ntill he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted affections were\nquite dead now; and, though he should never cease to be a faithful\nmourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously. Jo\n_wouldn't_ love him, but he might _make_ her respect and admire him by\ndoing something which should prove that a girl's \"No\" had not spoilt his\nlife. He had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was quite\nunnecessary. He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted\naffections were decently interred; that being done, he felt that he was\nready to \"hide his stricken heart, and still toil on.\"As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie\nresolved to embalm his love-sorrow in music, and compose a Requiem which\nshould harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer. Therefore\nthe next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody,\nand ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends,\nand fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself.\nBut, whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or music\ntoo ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem\nwas beyond him, just at present. It was evident that his mind was not in\nworking order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying; for often in the\nmiddle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself humming a dancing\ntune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the\nstout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the\ntime being."

He wanted Jo for his\nheroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender\nrecollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned\ntraitor; and, as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would\nonly recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in\nthe most unsentimental aspects,--beating mats with her head tied up in\na bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa-pillow, or throwing cold\nwater over his passion _√† la_ Gummidge,--and an irresistible laugh\nspoilt the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn't be\nput into the Opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a \"Bless\nthat girl, what a torment she is!\" and a clutch at his hair, as became a\ndistracted composer.When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to\nimmortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging\nreadiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair,\nwas enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his\nmind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and\nblue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he\ntook her for his heroine, and grew quite fond of her, as well he might;\nfor he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted\nher, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal\nwoman.Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but\ngradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he\nsat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas\nand refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state\nthat winter. He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was\nconscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. \"It's\ngenius simmering, perhaps. I'll let it simmer, and see what comes of\nit,\" he said, with a secret suspicion, all the while, that it wasn't\ngenius, but something far more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to\nsome purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory\nlife, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and\nbody, and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved\nmusic was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas,\nsplendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own,\nplayed a few of the best parts, sat staring up at the busts of\nMendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then\nsuddenly he tore up his music-sheets, one by one, and, as the last\nfluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself,--"

Now, if ever, occurred an eligible\nopportunity for \"going to the devil,\" as he once forcibly expressed it,\nfor he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially\nfond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow\nhad temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood\nthem pretty well; for, much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith\nand confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire\nto be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,\nand say \"All's well,\" kept him safe and steady.Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, \"I don't believe it; boys\nwill be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not\nexpect miracles.\" I dare say _you_ don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true\nnevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion\nthat they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by\nrefusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the longer the\nbetter, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must; but\nmothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one, and\nkeep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and showing\nthat they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which\nmake men manliest in good women's eyes. If it _is_ a feminine delusion,\nleave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and\nthe romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter\nall our hopes of the brave, tender-hearted little lads, who still love\ntheir mothers better than themselves, and are not ashamed to own it."

He refused to believe it at first, got angry with\nhimself, and couldn't understand it; but these hearts of ours are\ncurious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in\nspite of us. Laurie's heart _wouldn't_ ache; the wound persisted in\nhealing with a rapidity that astonished him, and, instead of trying to\nforget, he found himself trying to remember. He had not foreseen this\nturn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He was disgusted with\nhimself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of\ndisappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous\nblow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love, but\nthey refused to burst into a blaze: there was only a comfortable glow\nthat warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever, and he\nwas reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly\nsubsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and\nresentful still, but that was sure to pass away in time, leaving a\nbrotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.As the word \"brotherly\" passed through his mind in one of these\nreveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was\nbefore him:--\"Well, he was a great man; and when he couldn't have one sister he took\nthe other, and was happy.\"Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them; and the next\ninstant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself,--\"No, I won't! I haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if\nthat fails, why, then--\"Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to\nJo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the\nleast hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't she, and let\nhim come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he did nothing,\nbut he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience. It\ncame at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo\ndecidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She was wrapped up in Beth, and never\nwished to hear the word \"love\" again. Then she begged him to be happy\nwith somebody else, but always to keep a little corner of his heart for\nhis loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy\nthat Beth was worse; she was coming home in the spring, and there was no\nneed of saddening the remainder of her stay. That would be time enough,\nplease God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel\nlonely, homesick, or anxious.\"So I will, at once. Poor little girl; it will be a sad going home for\nher, I'm afraid;\" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had\nbeen the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks\nbefore."

With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered\nup all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small\ndrawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his\nfinger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the\ndrawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if\nthere had been a funeral; and, though not overwhelmed with affliction,\nthis seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in\nwriting letters to charming young ladies.[Illustration: Turning the ring thoughtfully upon his finger]The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy\n_was_ homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding\nmanner.

She ought to have made an effort, and tried to love him;\nit couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and glad to have\nsuch a dear boy care for them; but Jo never would act like other girls,\nso there was nothing to do but be very kind, and treat him like a\nbrother.If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they\nwould be a much happier race of beings than they are. Amy never lectured\nnow; she asked his opinion on all subjects; she was interested in\neverything he did, made charming little presents for him, and sent him\ntwo letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, and\ncaptivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. As few brothers are\ncomplimented by having their letters carried about in their sisters'\npockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when short, kissed when\nlong, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that Amy did any of\nthese fond and foolish things. But she certainly did grow a little pale\nand pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went\nout sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when she\ncame home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours,\nwith her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched\nany fancy that occurred to her,--a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a\nyoung man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a\ncurly-haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ball-room on the\narm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the\nlast fashion in art, which was safe, but not altogether satisfactory.Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred; and, finding\ndenials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what\nshe liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to\nEgypt. That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he\nsaid to himself, with a venerable air,--\"I was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I've been\nthrough it all, and I can sympathize.\"With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his\nduty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa, and enjoyed Amy's letter\nluxuriously."

The sad news met\nher at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they\nhad travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian\nlakes. She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the family decree\nthat she should not shorten her visit, for, since it was too late to say\ngood-by to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow.\nBut her heart was very heavy; she longed to be at home, and every day\nlooked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort\nher.He did come very soon; for the same mail brought letters to them both,\nbut he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him. The moment he\nread it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow-pedestrians,\nand was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow,\nhope and suspense.He knew Vevay well; and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he\nhurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living _en\npension_. The _gar√ßon_ was in despair that the whole family had gone to\ntake a promenade on the lake; but no, the blond mademoiselle might be in\nthe chateau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting\ndown, a flash of time should present her. But monsieur could not wait\neven \"a flash of time,\" and, in the middle of the speech, departed to\nfind mademoiselle himself."

At one corner of the wide, low\nwall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console\nherself with the beauty all about her. She was sitting here that day,\nleaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes,\nthinking of Beth, and wondering why Laurie did not come. She did not\nhear him cross the court-yard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway\nthat led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute,\nlooking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen\nbefore,--the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely\nsuggested love and sorrow,--the blotted letters in her lap, the black\nribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face;\neven the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for\nhe had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had\nany doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set at\nrest the minute she looked up and saw him; for, dropping everything, she\nran to him, exclaiming, in a tone of unmistakable love and longing,--\"O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!\"[Illustration: O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come]I think everything was said and settled then; for, as they stood\ntogether quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down\nprotectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and\nsustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only\nwoman in the world who could fill Jo's place, and make him happy. He did\nnot tell her so; but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth,\nwere satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.In a minute Amy went back to her place; and, while she dried her tears,\nLaurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry\nwell-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future. As\nhe sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the\nrecollection of her impulsive greeting.\"I couldn't help it; I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to\nsee you. It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was\nbeginning to fear you wouldn't come,\" she said, trying in vain to speak\nquite naturally.\"I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to comfort you\nfor the loss of dear little Beth; but I can only feel, and--\" He could\nnot get any further, for he, too, turned bashful all of a sudden, and\ndid not quite know what to say. He longed to lay Amy's head down on his\nshoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare; so took\nher hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than\nwords.\"You needn't say anything; this comforts me,\" she said softly. \"Beth is\nwell and happy, and I mustn't wish her back; but I dread the going home,\nmuch as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for it makes\nme cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay. You needn't go right\nback, need you?\"\"Not if you want me, dear.\""

  "content": "\"I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind; but you seem like one of the\nfamily, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while.\"Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child, whose heart was full,\nthat Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what\nshe wanted,--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation\nshe needed.\"Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half-sick! I'm\ngoing to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk\nabout with me; the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,\" he said, in\nthe half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on\nher hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the\nsunny walk, under the new-leaved chestnuts. He felt more at ease upon\nhis legs; and Amy found it very pleasant to have a strong arm to lean\nupon, a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk\ndelightfully for her alone.The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed\nexpressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but\nthe tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of\ntheir words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this new pair walked\nand talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which\ngave such a charm to time and place; and when an unromantic dinner-bell\nwarned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and\nsorrow behind her in the chateau garden.The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated\nwith a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, \"Now I understand it\nall,--the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my heart, I\nnever thought of such a thing!\"With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed\nno sign of enlightenment; but cordially urged Laurie to stay, and begged\nAmy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much\nsolitude. Amy was a model of docility; and, as her aunt was a good deal\noccupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it with\nmore than her usual success."

He said the change was\nowing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a\nlike excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked\nwholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get clearer\nviews of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills; the fresh\nwinds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists;\nthe warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas, tender\nhopes, and happy thoughts; the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of\nthe past, and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them,\nsaying, \"Little children, love one another.\"In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that\nLaurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him a little\nwhile to recover from his surprise at the rapid cure of his first, and,\nas he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled himself\nfor the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost\nthe same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been\nimpossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His\nfirst wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon\nit as if through a long vista of years, with a feeling of compassion\nblended with regret. He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of\nthe bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be grateful\nwhen the pain was over. His second wooing he resolved should be as calm\nand simple as possible; there was no need of having a scene, hardly any\nneed of telling Amy that he loved her; she knew it without words, and\nhad given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that\nno one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, even\nJo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be\nwary and slow in making a second trial; so Laurie let the days pass,\nenjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word\nthat would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance."

They had been\nfloating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny\nMontreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the\nDent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon\nthe hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake\nbelow, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged\ngulls.They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of\nRousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his \"H√©loise.\"\nNeither had read it, but they knew it was a love-story, and each\nprivately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had\nbeen dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell\nbetween them, and, when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars,\nwith an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for the\nsake of saying something,--\"You must be tired; rest a little, and let me row; it will do me good;\nfor, since you came, I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.\"\"I'm not tired; but you may take an oar, if you like. There's room\nenough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't\ntrim,\" returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered third\nof a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar. She rowed\nas well as she did many other things; and, though she used both hands,\nand Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went smoothly\nthrough the water.[Illustration: How well we pull together]\"How well we pull together, don't we?\" said Amy, who objected to silence\njust then.\"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,\nAmy?\" very tenderly.\"Yes, Laurie,\" very low.Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little\n_tableau_ of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected\nin the lake.XLII.ALL ALONE."

How could she \"comfort father and\nmother,\" when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her\nsister; how could she \"make the house cheerful,\" when all its light and\nwarmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home\nfor the new; and where in all the world could she \"find some useful,\nhappy work to do,\" that would take the place of the loving service which\nhad been its own reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her\nduty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust\nthat her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life\nget harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all\nsunshine, and some all shadow; it was not fair, for she tried more than\nAmy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble,\nand hard work.Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came\nover her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,\ndevoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never\nseemed to grow any easier. \"I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a life\nlike this, and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if\nsomebody don't come and help me,\" she said to herself, when her first\nefforts failed, and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind\nwhich often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.But some one did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good\nangels at once, because they wore familiar shapes, and used the simple\nspells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started up at night,\nthinking Beth called her; and when the sight of the little empty bed\nmade her cry with the bitter cry of an unsubmissive sorrow, \"O Beth,\ncome back! come back!\" she did not stretch out her yearning arms in\nvain; for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her\nsister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with\nwords only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears\nthat were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken\nwhispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went\nhand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to\nheart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,\nwhich chastened grief and strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo's burden\nseemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more\nendurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms.When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found\nhelp; for one day she went to the study, and, leaning over the good gray\nhead lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said, very\nhumbly,--\"Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she did, for\nI'm all wrong.\""

She gave him entire\nconfidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation\nin the act; for the time had come when they could talk together not only\nas father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve\neach other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. Happy,\nthoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called \"the church of\none member,\" and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered\ncheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit; for the parents who had\ntaught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach\nanother to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its\nbeautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.Other helps had Jo,--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would\nnot be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to\nsee and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as\nthey once had been, for Beth had presided over both; and something of\nher housewifely spirit seemed to linger round the little mop and the old\nbrush, that was never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found herself\nhumming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and\ngiving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and\ncosey, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she\ndidn't know it, till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the\nhand,--\"You thoughtful creter, you're determined we sha'n't miss that dear lamb\nef you can help it.

If she had suspected this,\nshe would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever;\nfortunately she wasn't thinking about herself, so, when the time came,\ndown she dropped."
