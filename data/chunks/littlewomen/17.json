  "content": "It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque\nscenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery,\nwhence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a\nbare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket\nover one shoulder, sat piping on a stone, while his goats skipped among\nthe rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with\npanniers of freshly-cut grass, passed by, with a pretty girl in a\n_capaline_ sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning\nwith a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the\nquaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on\nthe bough. Gnarled olive-trees covered the hills with their dusky\nfoliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones\nfringed the roadside; while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the\nMaritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.Valrosa well deserved its name, for, in that climate of perpetual\nsummer, roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust\nthemselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to\npassers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon-trees and\nfeathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where\nseats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom; every cool\ngrotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers, and every\nfountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to\nsmile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped\nthe cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of\nthe wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and\nthe white-walled city on its shore.\"This is a regular honeymoon Paradise, isn't it? Did you ever see such\nroses?\" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a\nluxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\"No, nor felt such thorns,\" returned Laurie, with his thumb in his\nmouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that\ngrew just beyond his reach."

  "content": "\"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,\" said Amy,\ngathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall\nbehind her. She put them in his button-hole, as a peace-offering, and he\nstood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in\nthe Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and\nhe was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,\nwhen imaginative young men find significance in trifles, and food for\nromance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny\nred rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like\nthat from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the\nsort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and,\nfor a moment, he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself; but the\nnext instant his American common-sense got the better of sentimentality,\nand he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard since he came.\"It's good advice; you'd better take it and save your fingers,\" she\nsaid, thinking her speech amused him.\"Thank you, I will,\" he answered in jest, and a few months later he did\nit in earnest.\"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?\" she asked presently,\nas she settled herself on a rustic seat.\"Very soon.\"\"You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.\"\"I dare say; short answers save trouble.\"\"He expects you, and you really ought to go.\"\"Hospitable creature! I know it.\"\"Then why don't you do it?\"\"Natural depravity, I suppose.\"\"Natural indolence, you mean. It's really dreadful!\" and Amy looked\nsevere.\"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I\nmight as well stay, and plague you a little longer, you can bear it\nbetter; in fact, I think it agrees with you excellently;\" and Laurie\ncomposed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.Amy shook her head, and opened her sketch-book with an air of\nresignation; but she had made up her mind to lecture \"that boy,\" and in\na minute she began again.\"What are you doing just now?\"\"Watching lizards.\"\"No, no; I mean what do you intend and wish to do?\"\"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me.\"\"How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars, and I will only allow\nit on condition that you let me put you into my sketch; I need a\nfigure.\"\"With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me,--full-length or\nthree-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully suggest a\nrecumbent posture, then put yourself in also, and call it '_Dolce far\nniente._'\"\"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. _I_ intend to work hard,\"\nsaid Amy, in her most energetic tone.\"What delightful enthusiasm!\" and he leaned against a tall urn with an\nair of entire satisfaction.\"What would Jo say if she saw you now?\" asked Amy impatiently, hoping to\nstir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name."

  "content": "\"As usual, 'Go away, Teddy, I'm busy!'\" He laughed as he spoke, but the\nlaugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the\nutterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed\nyet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them\nbefore, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on\nLaurie's face,--a hard, bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and\nregret. It was gone before she could study it, and the listless\nexpression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic\npleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in\nthe sun with uncovered head, and eyes full of southern dreaminess; for\nhe seemed to have forgotten her, and fallen into a reverie.\"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,\" she\nsaid, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark\nstone.\"Wish I was!\"\"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoilt your life. You are so\nchanged, I sometimes think--\" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,\nhalf-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated\nto express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used to\nsay it to her mother,--\"It's all right, ma'am.\"That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry\nher lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the\ncordial tone in which she said,--\"I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I\nfancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost\nyour heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into some\nof the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a\nforeign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun; come and lie on the grass\nhere, and 'let us be friendly,' as Jo used to say when we got in the\nsofa-corner and told secrets.\"[Illustration: Laurie threw himself down on the turf]Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse\nhimself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay\nthere.\"I'm all ready for the secrets;\" and he glanced up with a decided\nexpression of interest in his eyes.\"I've none to tell; you may begin.\"\"Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had some news\nfrom home.\"\"You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often? I\nfancied Jo would send you volumes.\"\"She's very busy; I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,\nyou know. When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?\" he\nasked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he\nhad been wondering if Amy knew his secret, and wanted to talk about it."

  "content": "\"Never,\" she answered, with a despondent but decided air. \"Rome took all\nthe vanity out of me; for after seeing the wonders there, I felt too\ninsignificant to live, and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.\"\"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?\"\"That's just why,--because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy\ncan make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a\ncommon-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more.\"\"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?\"\"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get the\nchance.\"It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring; but audacity becomes\nyoung people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. Laurie smiled,\nbut he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a\nlong-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.\"Good! and here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.\"Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her\ndowncast face, that made Laurie sit up and say gravely,--\"Now I'm going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?\"\"I don't promise to answer.\"\"Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of the world\nenough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred and\nyou last year, and it's my private opinion that, if he had not been\ncalled home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come\nof it--hey?\"\"That's not for me to say,\" was Amy's prim reply; but her lips would\nsmile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye, which betrayed\nthat she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.\"You are not engaged, I hope?\" and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly\nand grave all of a sudden.\"No.\"\"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down upon his\nknees, won't you?\"\"Very likely.\"\"Then you are fond of old Fred?\"\"I could be, if I tried.\"\"But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul, what\nunearthly prudence! He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I fancied\nyou'd like.\""

  "content": "\"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,\" began Amy, trying\nto be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of herself,\nin spite of the sincerity of her intentions.\"I understand; queens of society can't get on without money, so you mean\nto make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right and proper, as\nthe world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother's\ngirls.\"\"True, nevertheless.\"A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered\ncontrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this\ninstinctively, and laid himself down again, with a sense of\ndisappointment which he could not explain. His look and silence, as well\nas a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her resolve\nto deliver her lecture without delay.\"I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,\" she said\nsharply.\"Do it for me, there's a dear girl.\"\"I could, if I tried;\" and she looked as if she would like doing it in\nthe most summary style.\"Try, then; I give you leave,\" returned Laurie, who enjoyed having some\none to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.\"You'd be angry in five minutes.\"\"I'm never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire: you are\nas cool and soft as snow.\"\"You don't know what I can do; snow produces a glow and a tingle, if\napplied rightly. Your indifference is half affectation, and a good\nstirring up would prove it.\"\"Stir away; it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said\nwhen his little wife beat him. Regard me in the light of a husband or a\ncarpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees\nwith you.\"Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the\napathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and\nbegan:--\"Flo and I have got a new name for you; it's 'Lazy Laurence.' How do you\nlike it?\"She thought it would annoy him; but he only folded his arms under his\nhead, with an imperturbable \"That's not bad. Thank you, ladies.\"\"Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?\"\"Pining to be told.\"\"Well, I despise you.\""

  "content": "If she had even said \"I hate you,\" in a petulant or coquettish tone, he\nwould have laughed, and rather liked it; but the grave, almost sad,\naccent of her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly,--\"Why, if you please?\"\"Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are\nfaulty, lazy, and miserable.\"\"Strong language, mademoiselle.\"\"If you like it, I'll go on.\"\"Pray, do; it's quite interesting.\"\"I thought you'd find it so; selfish people always like to talk about\nthemselves.\"\"Am _I_ selfish?\" The question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone\nof surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was\ngenerosity.\"Yes, very selfish,\" continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as\neffective, just then, as an angry one. \"I'll show you how, for I've\nstudied you while we have been frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied\nwith you. Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing\nbut waste time and money and disappoint your friends.\"\"Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-years grind?\"\"You don't look as if you'd had much; at any rate, you are none the\nbetter for it, as far as I can see. I said, when we first met, that you\nhad improved. Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so nice\nas when I left you at home. You have grown abominably lazy; you like\ngossip, and waste time on frivolous things; you are contented to be\npetted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and respected\nby wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, and beauty,--ah, you\nlike that, Old Vanity! but it's the truth, so I can't help saying\nit,--with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you can find\nnothing to do but dawdle; and, instead of being the man you might and\nought to be, you are only--\" There she stopped, with a look that had\nboth pain and pity in it.\"Saint Laurence on a gridiron,\" added Laurie, blandly finishing the\nsentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a\nwide-awake sparkle in his eyes now, and a half-angry, half-injured\nexpression replaced the former indifference."

  "content": "\"I supposed you'd take it so. You men tell us we are angels, and say we\ncan make you what we will; but the instant we honestly try to do you\ngood, you laugh at us, and won't listen, which proves how much your\nflattery is worth.\" Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the\nexasperating martyr at her feet.In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,\nand Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child,--\"I will be good, oh, I will be good!\"But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest; and, tapping on the\noutspread hand with her pencil, said soberly,--\"Aren't you ashamed of a hand like that? It's as soft and white as a\nwoman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best\ngloves, and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven!\nso I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal-rings on it, only\nthe little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she was\nhere to help me!\"\"So do I!\"The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough in\nthe echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down at him with a\nnew thought in her mind; but he was lying with his hat half over his\nface, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. She only saw his\nchest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and\nthe hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to hide\nsomething too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute\nvarious hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy's mind,\nand told her what her sister never had confided to her. She remembered\nthat Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo; she recalled the shadow on\nhis face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the\nlittle old ring, which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls are\nquick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that\nperhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration, and now she\nwas sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and, when she spoke again, it was\nin a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to\nmake it so."

I never did\nlike that Miss Randal, and now I hate her!\" said artful Amy, wishing to\nbe sure of her facts this time.\"Hang Miss Randal!\" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look\nthat left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.\"I beg pardon; I thought--\" and there she paused diplomatically.\"No, you didn't; you knew perfectly well I never cared for any one but\nJo.\" Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face\naway as he spoke.\"I did think so; but as they never said anything about it, and you came\naway, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind to you? Why, I\nwas sure she loved you dearly.\"\"She _was_ kind, but not in the right way; and it's lucky for her she\ndidn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. It's\nher fault, though, and you may tell her so.\"The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled\nAmy, for she did not know what balm to apply.\"I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I can't\nhelp wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear.\"\"Don't, that's her name for me!\" and Laurie put up his hand with a quick\ngesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind, half-reproachful\ntone. \"Wait till you've tried it yourself,\" he added, in a low voice, as\nhe pulled up the grass by the handful.\"I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved,\" said\nAmy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it."

  "content": "Now, Laurie flattered himself that he _had_ borne it remarkably well,\nmaking no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live\nit down alone. Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for the\nfirst time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first\nfailure, and shut himself up in moody indifference. He felt as if\nsuddenly shaken out of a pensive dream, and found it impossible to go to\nsleep again. Presently he sat up, and asked slowly,--\"Do you think Jo would despise me as you do?\"\"Yes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don't you do\nsomething splendid, and _make_ her love you?\"\"I did my best, but it was no use.\"\"Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to have\ndone, for your grandfather's sake. It would have been shameful to fail\nafter spending so much time and money, when every one knew you _could_\ndo well.\"\"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,\" began Laurie,\nleaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.\"No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and\nproved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set about\nanother task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self again,\nand forget your trouble.\"\"That's impossible.\"\"Try it and see. You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 'Much she\nknows about such things.' I don't pretend to be wise, but I _am_\nobserving, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm\ninterested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies; and,\nthough I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit. Love\nJo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's\nwicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the one\nyou want. There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake up and\nbe a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.\"Neither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little ring on\nhis finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had\nbeen working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,\nmerely saying,--\"How do you like that?\"He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it\nwas capitally done,--the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless\nface, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the\nlittle wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head."

  "content": "\"How well you draw!\" he said, with genuine surprise and pleasure at her\nskill, adding, with a half-laugh,--\"Yes, that's me.\"\"As you are: this is as you were;\" and Amy laid another sketch beside\nthe one he held.It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it\nwhich atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that a\nsudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked. Only a rough\nsketch of Laurie taming a horse; hat and coat were off, and every line\nof the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude, was full\nof energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood arching\nhis neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing\nthe ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had\nmastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider's breezy hair and erect\nattitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of\nstrength, courage, and youthful buoyancy, that contrasted sharply with\nthe supine grace of the \"_Dolce far niente_\" sketch. Laurie said\nnothing; but, as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush\nup and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little\nlesson she had given him. That satisfied her; and, without waiting for\nhim to speak, she said, in her sprightly way,--[Illustration: A rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse]\"Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all\nlooked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and\nI sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the\nother day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.\"\"Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I congratulate\nyou. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon Paradise' that five\no'clock is the dinner-hour at your hotel?\""

He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air,\nbut it _was_ an affectation now, for the rousing had been more\nefficacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his\nmanner, and said to herself,--\"Now I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad; if it makes\nhim hate me, I'm sorry; but it's true, and I can't take back a word of\nit.\"They laughed and chatted all the way home; and little Baptiste, up\nbehind, thought that monsieur and mademoiselle were in charming spirits.\nBut both felt ill at ease; the friendly frankness was disturbed, the\nsunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gayety, there\nwas a secret discontent in the heart of each.\"Shall we see you this evening, _mon frère_?\" asked Amy as they parted\nat her aunt's door.\"Unfortunately I have an engagement. _Au revoir, mademoiselle_,\" and\nLaurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became\nhim better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and\nwarmly,--\"No; be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd\nrather have a hearty English hand-shake than all the sentimental\nsalutations in France.\"\"Good-by, dear,\" and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,\nLaurie left her, after a hand-shake almost painful in its heartiness.Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made\nher smile at the beginning and sigh at the end:--\"MY DEAR MENTOR,--\"Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself,\n    for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of\n    boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a\n    blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited\n    by a rouser.

They put away their grief, and each did his or her part toward\nmaking that last year a happy one.The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was\ngathered everything that she most loved,--flowers, pictures, her piano,\nthe little work-table, and the beloved pussies. Father's best books\nfound their way there, mother's easy-chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest\nsketches; and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,\nto make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart a little sum,\nthat he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with\nthe fruit she loved and longed for; old Hannah never wearied of\nconcocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears\nas she worked; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful\nletters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands\nthat know no winter.Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil\nand busy as ever; for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish nature,\nand even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for\nthose who should remain behind. The feeble fingers were never idle, and\none of her pleasures was to make little things for the school-children\ndaily passing to and fro,--to drop a pair of mittens from her window for\na pair of purple hands, a needle-book for some small mother of many\ndolls, pen-wipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pot-hooks,\nscrap-books for picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices,\ntill the reluctant climbers up the ladder of learning found their way\nstrewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as\na sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts\nmiraculously suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had wanted any\nreward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her\nwindow, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which came to\nher, full of blots and gratitude."

  "content": "The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look\nround, and say \"How beautiful this is!\" as they all sat together in her\nsunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and\nsisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from\nthe wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as\napplicable now as when written centuries ago; a little chapel, where a\npaternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying\nto show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation\npossible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of those who\nlistened; for the father's heart was in the minister's religion, and the\nfrequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he\nspoke or read.It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as\npreparation for the sad hours to come; for, by and by, Beth said the\nneedle was \"so heavy,\" and put it down forever; talking wearied her,\nfaces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil\nspirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble\nflesh. Ah me! such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching\nhearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced\nto see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the\nbitter cry, \"Help me, help me!\" and to feel that there was no help. A\nsad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with\ndeath; but both were mercifully brief, and then, the natural rebellion\nover, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck of\nher frail body, Beth's soul grew strong; and, though she said little,\nthose about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim\ncalled was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,\ntrying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed\nthe river.Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said, \"I feel stronger when\nyou are here.\" She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew\nthe fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom\nasked for anything, and \"tried not to be a trouble.\" All day she haunted\nthe room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then\nthan of any honor her life ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours\nto Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it needed; lessons\nin patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn\nthem; charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly\nforget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and\nthe sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly."

  "content": "Often, when she woke, Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little\nbook, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw\nher lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the\ntransparent fingers; and Jo would lie watching her, with thoughts too\ndeep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was\ntrying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the\nlife to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music\nshe loved so well.Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest\nhymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter; for, with\neyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest\nsorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life,--uneventful,\nunambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which \"smell sweet, and\nblossom in the dust,\" the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on\nearth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible\nto all.One night, when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find\nsomething to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as\nhard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite\nPilgrim's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's\nhand. The name caught her eye, and the blurred look of the lines made\nher sure that tears had fallen on it.\"Poor Jo! she's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave; she shows\nme all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at this,\"\nthought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug, with the\ntongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.\"MY BETH.\"Sitting patient in the shadow\n           Till the blessed light shall come,\n         A serene and saintly presence\n           Sanctifies our troubled home.\n         Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows\n           Break like ripples on the strand\n         Of the deep and solemn river\n           Where her willing feet now stand.\"O my sister, passing from me,\n           Out of human care and strife,\n         Leave me, as a gift, those virtues\n           Which have beautified your life.\n         Dear, bequeath me that great patience\n           Which has power to sustain\n         A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit\n           In its prison-house of pain."

As she sat with the paper folded between her hands, the\ncharred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze, and crept to\nthe bedside, hoping Beth slept.\"Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it; I knew\nyou wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?\" she asked, with\nwistful, humble earnestness.\"O Beth, so much, so much!\" and Jo's head went down upon the pillow,\nbeside her sister's.\"Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good as you make\nme, but I _have_ tried to do right; and now, when it's too late to\nbegin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that some one loves\nme so much, and feels as if I'd helped them.\"\"More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I couldn't let\nyou go; but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose you; that you'll be\nmore to me than ever, and death can't part us, though it seems to.\""

They\nwill turn to you, don't fail them; and if it's hard to work alone,\nremember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing\nthat than writing splendid books or seeing all the world; for love is\nthe only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the\nend so easy.\"\"I'll try, Beth;\" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,\npledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of\nother desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the\nimmortality of love.So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth\ngreener, the flowers were up fair and early, and the birds came back in\ntime to say good-by to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, clung\nto the hands that had led her all her life, as father and mother guided\nher tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up to God.Seldom, except in books, do the dying utter memorable words, see\nvisions, or depart with beatified countenances; and those who have sped\nmany parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and\nsimply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the \"tide went out easily;\" and in\nthe dark hour before the dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her\nfirst breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving\nlook, one little sigh.With tears and prayers and tender hands, mother and sisters made her\nready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with\ngrateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic\npatience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling, with reverent\njoy, that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom\nfull of dread.When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,\nJo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird sang\nblithely on a budding bough, close by, the snow-drops blossomed freshly\nat the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction\nover the placid face upon the pillow,--a face so full of painless peace\nthat those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked God\nthat Beth was well at last.[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Sat staring up at the busts]XLI.LEARNING TO FORGET."

Laurie went back to\nhis grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the\nold gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully,\nand he had better try it again. There was nothing the young gentleman\nwould have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back\nafter the scolding he had received; pride forbid, and whenever the\nlonging grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating the\nwords that had made the deepest impression, \"I despise you;\" \"Go and do\nsomething splendid that will _make_ her love you.\"Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought\nhimself to confess that he _had_ been selfish and lazy; but then when a\nman has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries\ntill he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted affections were\nquite dead now; and, though he should never cease to be a faithful\nmourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously. Jo\n_wouldn't_ love him, but he might _make_ her respect and admire him by\ndoing something which should prove that a girl's \"No\" had not spoilt his\nlife. He had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was quite\nunnecessary. He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted\naffections were decently interred; that being done, he felt that he was\nready to \"hide his stricken heart, and still toil on.\"As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie\nresolved to embalm his love-sorrow in music, and compose a Requiem which\nshould harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer. Therefore\nthe next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody,\nand ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends,\nand fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself.\nBut, whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or music\ntoo ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem\nwas beyond him, just at present. It was evident that his mind was not in\nworking order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying; for often in the\nmiddle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself humming a dancing\ntune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the\nstout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the\ntime being."

He wanted Jo for his\nheroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender\nrecollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned\ntraitor; and, as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would\nonly recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in\nthe most unsentimental aspects,--beating mats with her head tied up in\na bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa-pillow, or throwing cold\nwater over his passion _à la_ Gummidge,--and an irresistible laugh\nspoilt the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn't be\nput into the Opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a \"Bless\nthat girl, what a torment she is!\" and a clutch at his hair, as became a\ndistracted composer.When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to\nimmortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging\nreadiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair,\nwas enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his\nmind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and\nblue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he\ntook her for his heroine, and grew quite fond of her, as well he might;\nfor he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted\nher, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal\nwoman.Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but\ngradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he\nsat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas\nand refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state\nthat winter. He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was\nconscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. \"It's\ngenius simmering, perhaps. I'll let it simmer, and see what comes of\nit,\" he said, with a secret suspicion, all the while, that it wasn't\ngenius, but something far more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to\nsome purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory\nlife, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and\nbody, and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved\nmusic was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas,\nsplendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own,\nplayed a few of the best parts, sat staring up at the busts of\nMendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then\nsuddenly he tore up his music-sheets, one by one, and, as the last\nfluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself,--"

Now what shall I do?\"That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had\nto work for his daily bread. Now, if ever, occurred an eligible\nopportunity for \"going to the devil,\" as he once forcibly expressed it,\nfor he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially\nfond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow\nhad temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood\nthem pretty well; for, much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith\nand confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire\nto be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,\nand say \"All's well,\" kept him safe and steady.Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, \"I don't believe it; boys\nwill be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not\nexpect miracles.\" I dare say _you_ don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true\nnevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion\nthat they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by\nrefusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the longer the\nbetter, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must; but\nmothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one, and\nkeep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and showing\nthat they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which\nmake men manliest in good women's eyes. If it _is_ a feminine delusion,\nleave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and\nthe romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter\nall our hopes of the brave, tender-hearted little lads, who still love\ntheir mothers better than themselves, and are not ashamed to own it."

  "content": "Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb\nall his powers for years; but, to his great surprise, he discovered it\ngrew easier every day. He refused to believe it at first, got angry with\nhimself, and couldn't understand it; but these hearts of ours are\ncurious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in\nspite of us. Laurie's heart _wouldn't_ ache; the wound persisted in\nhealing with a rapidity that astonished him, and, instead of trying to\nforget, he found himself trying to remember. He had not foreseen this\nturn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He was disgusted with\nhimself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of\ndisappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous\nblow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love, but\nthey refused to burst into a blaze: there was only a comfortable glow\nthat warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever, and he\nwas reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly\nsubsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and\nresentful still, but that was sure to pass away in time, leaving a\nbrotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.As the word \"brotherly\" passed through his mind in one of these\nreveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was\nbefore him:--\"Well, he was a great man; and when he couldn't have one sister he took\nthe other, and was happy.\"Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them; and the next\ninstant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself,--\"No, I won't! I haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if\nthat fails, why, then--\"Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to\nJo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the\nleast hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't she, and let\nhim come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he did nothing,\nbut he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience. It\ncame at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo\ndecidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She was wrapped up in Beth, and never\nwished to hear the word \"love\" again. Then she begged him to be happy\nwith somebody else, but always to keep a little corner of his heart for\nhis loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy\nthat Beth was worse; she was coming home in the spring, and there was no\nneed of saddening the remainder of her stay. That would be time enough,\nplease God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel\nlonely, homesick, or anxious.\"So I will, at once. Poor little girl; it will be a sad going home for\nher, I'm afraid;\" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had\nbeen the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks\nbefore."

Tumbling\nabout in one part of the desk, among bills, passports, and business\ndocuments of various kinds, were several of Jo's letters, and in another\ncompartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her\nblue ribbons, and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away\ninside. With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered\nup all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small\ndrawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his\nfinger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the\ndrawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if\nthere had been a funeral; and, though not overwhelmed with affliction,\nthis seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in\nwriting letters to charming young ladies.[Illustration: Turning the ring thoughtfully upon his finger]The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy\n_was_ homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding\nmanner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and\nfro, with unfailing regularity, all through the early spring. Laurie\nsold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,\nhoping somebody would arrive before long. He wanted desperately to go to\nNice, but would not till he was asked; and Amy would not ask him, for\njust then she was having little experiences of her own, which made her\nrather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of \"our boy.\""
