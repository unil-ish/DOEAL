  "content": "To outsiders, the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so\nthey did in many things; but the quiet scholar, sitting among his books,\nwas still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and\ncomforter; for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous\ntimes, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred words, husband\nand father.The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls\ninto their father's; and to both parents, who lived and labored so\nfaithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth, and\nbound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and\noutlives death.Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we\nsaw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the\nhospitals and homes, still full of wounded \"boys\" and soldiers' widows,\ndecidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent\nhome, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars, but he\ndeserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had; and life and love\nare very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his\ndischarge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business,\nand earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence\nthat characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more generous offers,\nand accepted the place of book-keeper feeling better satisfied to begin\nwith an honestly-earned salary, than by running any risks with borrowed\nmoney."

  "content": "Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in\ncharacter, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever; for love is\na great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt\nsome disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin.\nNed Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help\ncontrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid\noutfit, with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But\nsomehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the\npatient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her;\nand when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small\nplans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot\nSallie's splendor, and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in\nChristendom.Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to\nAmy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of\nthe best teachers going; and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would\nhave served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her\nafternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo, meantime, devoted\nherself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the\nfever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again\nthe rosy, healthy creature she had been; yet always hopeful, happy, and\nserene, busy with the quiet duties she loved, every one's friend, and an\nangel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to\nknow it.As long as \"The Spread Eagle\" paid her a dollar a column for her\n\"rubbish,\" as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun\nher little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy\nbrain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a\nslowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place\nthe name of March upon the roll of fame.Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was\nnow getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please\nhimself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,\nand the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to\nget other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoilt,\nand probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had\nnot possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man\nwho was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over\nhim as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the\nknowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him\nwith all their hearts."

But as high spirits and the\nlove of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save\nhimself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible\npower of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather\nprided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with\ngraphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified\nprofessors, and vanquished enemies. The \"men of my class\" were heroes in\nthe eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of \"our\nfellows,\" and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these\ngreat creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among\nthem; for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of\nfascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her\nprivate and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and\nBeth too shy to do more than peep at them, and wonder how Amy dared to\norder them about so; but Jo felt quite in her element, and found it very\ndifficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases,\nand feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed\nfor young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love\nwith her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a\nsentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine. And speaking of sentiment\nbrings us very naturally to the \"Dove-cote.\""

  "content": "That was the name of the little brown house which Mr. Brooke had\nprepared for Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was\nhighly appropriate to the gentle lovers, who \"went on together like a\npair of turtle-doves, with first a bill and then a coo.\" It was a tiny\nhouse, with a little garden behind, and a lawn about as big as a\npocket-handkerchief in front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain,\nshrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers; though just at present,\nthe fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a\ndilapidated slop-bowl; the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,\nundecided whether to live or die; and the profusion of flowers was\nmerely hinted by regiments of sticks, to show where seeds were planted.\nBut inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault\nfrom garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow, it was\nfortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in\nwhole; the dining-room was so small that six people were a tight fit;\nand the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of\nprecipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coal-bin. But\nonce get used to these slight blemishes, and nothing could be more\ncomplete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the\nfurnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no\nmarble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little\nparlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a\nstand of flowers in the bay-window, and, scattered all about, the pretty\ngifts which came from friendly hands, and were the fairer for the loving\nmessages they brought.I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty\nbecause John put up the bracket it stood upon; that any upholsterer\ncould have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's\nartistic hand; or that any store-room was ever better provided with good\nwishes, merry words, and happy hopes, than that in which Jo and her\nmother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles; and I am morally\ncertain that the spandy-new kitchen never _could_ have looked so cosey\nand neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times\nover, and laid the fire all ready for lighting, the minute \"Mis. Brooke\ncame home.\" I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so\nrich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece-bags; for Beth made enough\nto last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three\ndifferent kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal\nchina.People who hire all these things done for them never know what they\nlose; for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,\nand Meg found so many proofs of this, that everything in her small nest,\nfrom the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was\neloquent of home love and tender forethought."

In his love of jokes, this\nyoung gentleman, though nearly through college, was as much of a boy as\never. His last whim had been to bring with him, on his weekly visits,\nsome new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a\nbag of remarkable clothes-pins; next, a wonderful nutmeg-grater, which\nfell to pieces at the first trial; a knife-cleaner that spoilt all the\nknives; or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet, and left\nthe dirt; labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands;\ninfallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the\ndeluded buyer; and every kind of tin-ware, from a toy savings-bank for\nodd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own\nsteam, with every prospect of exploding in the process.In vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him\n\"Mr. Toodles.\" He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee\ningenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week\nbeheld some fresh absurdity.Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored\nsoaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the table\nfor the first meal.\"Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you\nshould be happy here?\" asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went\nthrough the new kingdom, arm-in-arm; for just then they seemed to cling\ntogether more tenderly than ever.\"Yes, mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and _so_ happy\nthat I can't talk about it,\" answered Meg, with a look that was better\nthan words.\"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,\" said Amy,\ncoming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether\nthe bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantle-piece.\"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try\nher way first. There will be so little to do, that, with Lotty to run my\nerrands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to\nkeep me from getting lazy or homesick,\" answered Meg tranquilly.\"Sallie Moffat has four,\" began Amy.\"If Meg had four the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis\nwould have to camp in the garden,\" broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big\nblue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door-handles."

Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that\nthere will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big\none. It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves\nnothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first\nmarried, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so\nthat I might have the pleasure of mending them; for I got heartily sick\nof doing fancy work and tending my pocket handkerchief.\"\"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she\ndoes, to amuse herself, though they never turn out well, and the\nservants laugh at her,\" said Meg.\"I did, after a while; not to 'mess,' but to learn of Hannah how things\nshould be done, that my servants need _not_ laugh at me. It was play\nthen; but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only\npossessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little\ngirls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You\nbegin at the other end, Meg, dear; but the lessons you learn now will be\nof use to you by and by, when John is a richer man, for the mistress of\na house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she\nwishes to be well and honestly served.\"\"Yes, mother, I'm sure of that,\" said Meg, listening respectfully to the\nlittle lecture; for the best of women will hold forth upon the\nall-absorbing subject of housekeeping. \"Do you know I like this room\nmost of all in my baby-house,\" added Meg, a minute after, as they went\nupstairs, and she looked into her well-stored linen-closet."

You see, having said that if Meg married \"that\nBrooke\" she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in\na quandary, when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her\nvow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her mind how to\nget round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy\nherself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to buy, have made,\nand marked, a generous supply of house and table linen, and send it as\n_her_ present, all of which was faithfully done; but the secret leaked\nout, and was greatly enjoyed by the family; for Aunt March tried to look\nutterly unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the\nold-fashioned pearls, long promised to the first bride.\"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young friend\nwho set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for\ncompany, and that satisfied her,\" said Mrs. March, patting the damask\ntable-cloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.\"I haven't a single finger-bowl, but this is a 'set out' that will last\nme all my days, Hannah says;\" and Meg looked quite contented, as well\nshe might.\"Toodles is coming,\" cried Jo from below; and they all went down to meet\nLaurie, whose weekly visit was an important event in their quiet lives.A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt-basin\nof a hat, and a fly-away coat, came tramping down the road at a great\npace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate,\nstraight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out, and a hearty--\"Here I am, mother! Yes, it's all right.\"The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him; a\nkindly questioning look, which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the\nlittle ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.\"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and compliments.\nBless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are, Jo. Amy, you are\ngetting altogether too handsome for a single lady.\"As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth's\nhair-ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of\nmock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and every one began\nto talk.\"Where is John?\" asked Meg anxiously.\"Stopped to get the license for to-morrow, ma'am.\"\"Which side won the last match, Teddy?\" inquired Jo, who persisted in\nfeeling an interest in manly sports, despite her nineteen years.\"Ours, of course. Wish you'd been there to see.\"\"How is the lovely Miss Randal?\" asked Amy, with a significant smile.\"More cruel than ever; don't you see how I'm pining away?\" and Laurie\ngave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh."

Nice thing, isn't it?\" and Laurie gave them a sample of its\npowers that made them cover up their ears.\"There's gratitude for you! and speaking of gratitude reminds me to\nmention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding-cake from\ndestruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she\nhadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked\nlike a remarkably plummy one.\"\"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,\" said Meg, in a matronly\ntone.\"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as six\nfeet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,\" responded the\nyoung gentleman, whose head was about level with the little chandelier.\n\"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick and\nspan new bower, so, as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an\nadjournment,\" he added presently.\"Mother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things to\nsettle,\" said Meg, bustling away.\"Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for\nto-morrow,\" added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque\ncurls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.\"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow.

I don't wish to get\ncross, so let's change the subject;\" and Jo looked quite ready to fling\ncold water on the slightest provocation.Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in a\nlong low whistle, and the fearful prediction, as they parted at the\ngate, \"Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next.\"[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: The First Wedding]XXV.THE FIRST WEDDING.The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that\nmorning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine, like\nfriendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with excitement\nwere their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one\nanother what they had seen; for some peeped in at the dining-room\nwindows, where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile at\nthe sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those\nwho came and went on various errands in garden, porch, and hall, and\nall, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby-bud, offered\ntheir tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had\nloved and tended them so long.Meg looked very like a rose herself; for all that was best and sweetest\nin heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it fair\nand tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk, lace,\nnor orange-flowers would she have. \"I don't want to look strange or\nfixed up to-day,\" she said. \"I don't want a fashionable wedding, but\nonly those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to look and be my\nfamiliar self.\"So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes\nand innocent romances of a girlish heart. Her sisters braided up her\npretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the\nvalley, which \"her John\" liked best of all the flowers that grew.\"You _do_ look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely\nthat I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,\" cried Amy,\nsurveying her with delight, when all was done."

The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,\nmore becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a\nfresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only\ngentle words fall from her sharp tongue to-day.Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever; the beautiful,\nkind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,\nalthough it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches\nthe young face with such pathetic patience; but Beth seldom complains,\nand always speaks hopefully of \"being better soon.\"Amy is with truth considered \"the flower of the family;\" for at sixteen\nshe has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman--not beautiful, but\npossessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the\nlines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her\ndress, the droop of her hair,--unconscious, yet harmonious, and as\nattractive to many as beauty itself. Amy's nose still afflicted her, for\nit never _would_ grow Grecian; so did her mouth, being too wide, and\nhaving a decided chin. These offending features gave character to her\nwhole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her\nwonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls, more golden and\nabundant than ever."

I'm too happy to\ncare what any one says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little\nwedding just as I like it. John, dear, here's your hammer;\" and away\nwent Meg to help \"that man\" in his highly improper employment.Mr. Brooke didn't even say \"Thank you,\" but as he stooped for the\nunromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding-door,\nwith a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket-handkerchief, with\na sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous\nexclamation, \"Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset the cake again!\" caused a\nmomentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived,\nand \"the party came in,\" as Beth used to say when a child.\"Don't let that young giant come near me; he worries me worse than\nmosquitoes,\" whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled, and\nLaurie's black head towered above the rest.\"He has promised to be very good to-day, and he _can_ be perfectly\nelegant if he likes,\" returned Amy, gliding away to warn Hercules to\nbeware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady\nwith a devotion that nearly distracted her."

Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder,\nbut Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of\nsunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly\nmarried, Meg cried, \"The first kiss for Marmee!\" and, turning, gave it\nwith her heart on her lips. During the next fifteen minutes she looked\nmore like a rose than ever, for every one availed themselves of their\nprivileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,\nadorned with a head-dress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her\nin the hall, crying, with a sob and a chuckle, \"Bless you, deary, a\nhundred times! The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely.\"Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried\nto, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light.\nThere was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little\nhouse, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of\ncake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt March\nshrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were\nfound to be the only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried\nround. No one said anything, however, till Laurie, who insisted on\nserving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand\nand a puzzled expression on his face.\"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?\" he whispered, \"or am I\nmerely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this\nmorning?\""

You know he thinks that wine\nshould be used only in illness, and mother says that neither she nor her\ndaughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.\"Meg spoke seriously, and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh; but he\ndid neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous\nway, \"I like that! for I've seen enough harm done to wish other women\nwould think as you do.\"\"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?\" and there was an anxious\naccent in Meg's voice.\"No; I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me, either; this\nis not one of my temptations. Being brought up where wine is as common\nas water, and almost as harmless, I don't care for it; but when a pretty\ngirl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see.\"\"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,\nLaurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest\nday of my life.\"A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,\nfor ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if\nhe gave the promise he would keep it at all costs; and, feeling her\npower, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak,\nbut she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,\nand a smile which said, \"No one can refuse me anything to-day.\" Laurie\ncertainly could not; and, with an answering smile, he gave her his hand,\nsaying heartily, \"I promise, Mrs. Brooke!\"\"I thank you, very, very much.\"\"And I drink 'long life to your resolution,' Teddy,\" cried Jo, baptizing\nhim with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass, and beamed\napprovingly upon him.So the toast was drunk, the pledge made, and loyally kept, in spite of\nmany temptations; for, with instinctive wisdom, the girls had seized a\nhappy moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all\nhis life."

Meg and John\nhappened to be standing together in the middle of the grass-plot, when\nLaurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to\nthis unfashionable wedding.\"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband\nand wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in\ncouples outside!\" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy, with\nsuch infectious spirit and skill that every one else followed their\nexample without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol,\nbegan it; others rapidly joined in; even Sallie Moffat, after a moment's\nhesitation, threw her train over her arm, and whisked Ned into the ring.\nBut the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March; for when the\nstately old gentleman _chasséed_ solemnly up to the old lady, she just\ntucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands\nwith the rest, and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks\npervaded the garden, like butterflies on a midsummer day.Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people\nbegan to go.\"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well; but I think you'll\nbe sorry for it,\" said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as\nhe led her to the carriage, \"You've got a treasure, young man, see that\nyou deserve it.\"\"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I don't\nsee why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,\" observed Mrs. Moffat\nto her husband, as they drove away.\"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get\none of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly\nsatisfied,\" said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy-chair to\nrest, after the excitement of the morning.\"I'll do my best to gratify you, sir,\" was Laurie's unusually dutiful\nreply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his button-hole."

Amy was learning this\ndistinction through much tribulation; for, mistaking enthusiasm for\ninspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.\nFor a long time there was a lull in the \"mud-pie\" business, and she\ndevoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed\nsuch taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant\nand profitable. But overstrained eyes soon caused pen and ink to be laid\naside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,\nthe family lived in constant fear of a conflagration; for the odor of\nburning wood pervaded the house at all hours; smoke issued from attic\nand shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about\npromiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and\nthe dinner-bell at her door, in case of fire. Raphael's face was found\nboldly executed on the under side of the moulding-board, and Bacchus on\nthe head of a beer-barrel; a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the\nsugar-bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied\nkindlings for some time."

An artist friend fitted her\nout with his cast-off palettes, brushes, and colors; and she daubed\naway, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on\nland or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken\nprizes at an agricultural fair; and the perilous pitching of her vessels\nwould have produced sea-sickness in the most nautical observer, if the\nutter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not\nconvulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and\ndark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,\nsuggested Murillo; oily-brown shadows of faces, with a lurid streak in\nthe wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropsical infants,\nRubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange\nlightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash\nin the middle, which might be the sun or a buoy, a sailor's shirt or a\nking's robe, as the spectator pleased.Charcoal portraits came next; and the entire family hung in a row,\nlooking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coal-bin. Softened\ninto crayon sketches, they did better; for the likenesses were good, and\nAmy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were pronounced\n\"wonderfully fine.\" A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly\ncasts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off\ncloset-shelves on to people's heads. Children were enticed in as models,\ntill their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy\nto be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line,\nhowever, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which\nquenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook\nto cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an\nunearthly bumping and screaming, and running to the rescue, found the\nyoung enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed, with her foot held fast\nin a pan-full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity.\nWith much difficulty and some danger she was dug out; for Jo was so\novercome with laughter while she excavated, that her knife went too far,\ncut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt,\nat least.[Illustration: Her foot held fast in a panful of plaster]After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her\nto haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing\nfor ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to\nbook \"a delicious bit,\" composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and\na broken mullein-stalk, or \"a heavenly mass of clouds,\" that looked like\na choice display of feather-beds when done. She sacrificed her\ncomplexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun, to study light\nand shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose, trying after \"points of\nsight,\" or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called."

Here she succeeded better; for she was one\nof those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends\neverywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate\nsouls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star.\nEverybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. She had an\ninstinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right\nthing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and\nwas so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, \"If Amy went to\ncourt without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do.\"One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in \"our best society,\"\nwithout being quite sure what the _best_ really was. Money, position,\nfashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable\nthings in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed\nthem, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not\nadmirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she\ncultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the\nopportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty\nnow excluded her.\"My lady,\" as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine\nlady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy\nrefinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and\nthat true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.\"I want to ask a favor of you, mamma,\" Amy said, coming in, with an\nimportant air, one day.\"Well, little girl, what is it?\" replied her mother, in whose eyes the\nstately young lady still remained \"the baby.\""
