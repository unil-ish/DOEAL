Undo the bundle and see, Meg,\" said Beth, eying\nthe knobby parcel with curiosity.\"It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,\"\nobserved Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of\nthe girls.[Illustration: A small watchman's rattle]\"Any time when John is away, and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just\nswing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood\nin a jiffy. Nice thing, isn't it?\" and Laurie gave them a sample of its\npowers that made them cover up their ears.\"There's gratitude for you! and speaking of gratitude reminds me to\nmention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding-cake from\ndestruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she\nhadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked\nlike a remarkably plummy one.\"\"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,\" said Meg, in a matronly\ntone.\"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as six\nfeet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,\" responded the\nyoung gentleman, whose head was about level with the little chandelier.\n\"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick and\nspan new bower, so, as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an\nadjournment,\" he added presently.\"Mother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things to\nsettle,\" said Meg, bustling away.\"Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for\nto-morrow,\" added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque\ncurls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.\"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow. I'm in such a state of exhaustion I\ncan't get home without help. Don't take off your apron, whatever you do;\nit's peculiarly becoming,\" said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial\naversion in her capacious pocket, and offered him her arm to support his\nfeeble steps.\"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about to-morrow,\" began Jo,\nas they strolled away together. \"You _must_ promise to behave well, and\nnot cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.\"\"Not a prank.\""

I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.\"\"Exactly. I say, Jo, how is grandpa this week; pretty amiable?\"\"Very; why, have you got into a scrape, and want to know how he'll take\nit?\" asked Jo rather sharply.\"Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face, and say 'All\nright,' if it wasn't?\" and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.\"No, I don't.\"\"Then don't go and be suspicious; I only want some money,\" said Laurie,\nwalking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.\"You spend a great deal, Teddy.\"\"Bless you, _I_ don't spend it; it spends itself, somehow, and is gone\nbefore I know it.\"\"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and\ncan't say 'No' to any one.

I\nthought you'd got over the dandy period; but every now and then it\nbreaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be hideous,--to\nmake your head look like a scrubbing-brush, wear a strait-jacket,\norange gloves, and clumping, square-toed boots. If it was cheap\nugliness, I'd say nothing; but it costs as much as the other, and I\ndon't get any satisfaction out of it.\""

Nobody will want\nme, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a\nfamily.\"\"You won't give any one a chance,\" said Laurie, with a sidelong glance,\nand a little more color than before in his sunburnt face. \"You won't\nshow the soft side of your character; and if a fellow gets a peep at it\nby accident, and can't help showing that he likes it, you treat him as\nMrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart,--throw cold water over him,--and get\nso thorny no one dares touch or look at you.\""

I don't wish to get\ncross, so let's change the subject;\" and Jo looked quite ready to fling\ncold water on the slightest provocation.Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in a\nlong low whistle, and the fearful prediction, as they parted at the\ngate, \"Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next.\"[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: The First Wedding]XXV.THE FIRST WEDDING.The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that\nmorning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine, like\nfriendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with excitement\nwere their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one\nanother what they had seen; for some peeped in at the dining-room\nwindows, where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile at\nthe sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those\nwho came and went on various errands in garden, porch, and hall, and\nall, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby-bud, offered\ntheir tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had\nloved and tended them so long.Meg looked very like a rose herself; for all that was best and sweetest\nin heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it fair\nand tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk, lace,\nnor orange-flowers would she have. \"I don't want to look strange or\nfixed up to-day,\" she said. \"I don't want a fashionable wedding, but\nonly those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to look and be my\nfamiliar self.\"So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes\nand innocent romances of a girlish heart. Her sisters braided up her\npretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the\nvalley, which \"her John\" liked best of all the flowers that grew.\"You _do_ look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely\nthat I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,\" cried Amy,\nsurveying her with delight, when all was done."

But please hug and kiss me, every one, and don't\nmind my dress; I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it\nto-day;\" and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her\nwith April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not changed\nthe old.\"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few\nminutes with father quietly in the study;\" and Meg ran down to perform\nthese little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she\nwent, conscious that, in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there\nwas a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first\nbird from the nest.As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their\nsimple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which\nthree years have wrought in their appearance; for all are looking their\nbest just now.Jo's angles are much softened; she has learned to carry herself with\nease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,\nmore becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a\nfresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only\ngentle words fall from her sharp tongue to-day.Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever; the beautiful,\nkind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,\nalthough it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches\nthe young face with such pathetic patience; but Beth seldom complains,\nand always speaks hopefully of \"being better soon.\"Amy is with truth considered \"the flower of the family;\" for at sixteen\nshe has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman--not beautiful, but\npossessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the\nlines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her\ndress, the droop of her hair,--unconscious, yet harmonious, and as\nattractive to many as beauty itself. Amy's nose still afflicted her, for\nit never _would_ grow Grecian; so did her mouth, being too wide, and\nhaving a decided chin. These offending features gave character to her\nwhole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her\nwonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls, more golden and\nabundant than ever."

Jo's upset the cake again!\" caused a\nmomentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived,\nand \"the party came in,\" as Beth used to say when a child.\"Don't let that young giant come near me; he worries me worse than\nmosquitoes,\" whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled, and\nLaurie's black head towered above the rest.\"He has promised to be very good to-day, and he _can_ be perfectly\nelegant if he likes,\" returned Amy, gliding away to warn Hercules to\nbeware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady\nwith a devotion that nearly distracted her."

Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder,\nbut Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of\nsunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly\nmarried, Meg cried, \"The first kiss for Marmee!\" and, turning, gave it\nwith her heart on her lips. During the next fifteen minutes she looked\nmore like a rose than ever, for every one availed themselves of their\nprivileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,\nadorned with a head-dress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her\nin the hall, crying, with a sob and a chuckle, \"Bless you, deary, a\nhundred times! The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely.\"Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried\nto, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light.\nThere was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little\nhouse, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of\ncake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt March\nshrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were\nfound to be the only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried\nround. No one said anything, however, till Laurie, who insisted on\nserving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand\nand a puzzled expression on his face.\"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?\" he whispered, \"or am I\nmerely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this\nmorning?\""

Amy was learning this\ndistinction through much tribulation; for, mistaking enthusiasm for\ninspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.\nFor a long time there was a lull in the \"mud-pie\" business, and she\ndevoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed\nsuch taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant\nand profitable. But overstrained eyes soon caused pen and ink to be laid\naside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,\nthe family lived in constant fear of a conflagration; for the odor of\nburning wood pervaded the house at all hours; smoke issued from attic\nand shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about\npromiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and\nthe dinner-bell at her door, in case of fire.

Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken\nprizes at an agricultural fair; and the perilous pitching of her vessels\nwould have produced sea-sickness in the most nautical observer, if the\nutter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not\nconvulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and\ndark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,\nsuggested Murillo; oily-brown shadows of faces, with a lurid streak in\nthe wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropsical infants,\nRubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange\nlightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash\nin the middle, which might be the sun or a buoy, a sailor's shirt or a\nking's robe, as the spectator pleased.Charcoal portraits came next; and the entire family hung in a row,\nlooking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coal-bin. Softened\ninto crayon sketches, they did better; for the likenesses were good, and\nAmy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were pronounced\n\"wonderfully fine.\" A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly\ncasts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off\ncloset-shelves on to people's heads. Children were enticed in as models,\ntill their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy\nto be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line,\nhowever, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which\nquenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook\nto cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an\nunearthly bumping and screaming, and running to the rescue, found the\nyoung enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed, with her foot held fast\nin a pan-full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity.\nWith much difficulty and some danger she was dug out; for Jo was so\novercome with laughter while she excavated, that her knife went too far,\ncut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt,\nat least.[Illustration: Her foot held fast in a panful of plaster]After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her\nto haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing\nfor ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to\nbook \"a delicious bit,\" composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and\na broken mullein-stalk, or \"a heavenly mass of clouds,\" that looked like\na choice display of feather-beds when done. She sacrificed her\ncomplexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun, to study light\nand shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose, trying after \"points of\nsight,\" or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called."

I know\nthat I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help\na little; and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it,\"\nsaid Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into\nobstinacy.Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it\nwas possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she\nwould gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice\nas much as they did salts and senna.\"Very well, Amy; if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way\nthrough without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll say\nno more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you decide, I'll\ndo my best to help you.\"\"Thanks, mother; you are always _so_ kind;\" and away went Amy to lay her\nplan before her sisters.Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she\npossessed, from her little house itself to her very best salt-spoons.\nBut Jo frowned upon the whole project, and would have nothing to do with\nit at first.\"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and\nturn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a\nsixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle\nto any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a\n_coupé_,\" said Jo, who, being called from the tragical climax of her\nnovel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.\"I _don't_ truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!\"\nreturned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions\narose. \"The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great\ndeal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you\ncall fashionable nonsense. You don't care to make people like you, to go\ninto good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I\nmean to make the most of every chance that comes. _You_ can go through\nthe world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it\nindependence, if you like. That's not my way.\""

Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a good\nhit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more amiable\nturn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day\nto Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she regarded as \"a\nnonsensical business.\"The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following Monday\nwas set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor because her\nweek's work was deranged, and prophesied that \"ef the washin' and\nironin' warn't done reg'lar nothin' would go well anywheres.\" This hitch\nin the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the\nwhole concern; but Amy's motto was \"Nil desperandum,\" and having made up\nher mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles.\nTo begin with, Hannah's cooking didn't turn out well: the chicken was\ntough, the tongue too salt, and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.\nThen the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon; and\nvarious other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up\nrather alarmingly afterward. Beth got cold and took to her bed, Meg had\nan unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a\ndivided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were\nuncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.\"If it hadn't been for mother I never should have got through,\" as Amy\ndeclared afterward, and gratefully remembered when \"the best joke of the\nseason\" was entirely forgotten by everybody else."

On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which\nis more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a\nlittle, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late\nfor any one else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people\nout of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be\ngot in order. The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby; but\nwithout stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skilfully made the\nbest of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the\ncarpet, covering stains on the walls with pictures framed in ivy, and\nfilling up empty corners with home-made statuary, which gave an artistic\nair to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.The lunch looked charmingly; and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped\nit would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver\nwould get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and mother\nwere all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the\nscenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, an\naching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything\nwould allow, and, as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with\nanticipations of the happy moment, when, lunch safely over, she should\ndrive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights; for\nthe \"cherry-bounce\" and the broken bridge were her strong points.Then came two hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor\nto porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart\nshower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young\nladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came; and at two the\nexhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the\nperishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.\"No doubt about the weather to-day; they will certainly come, so we must\nfly round and be ready for them,\" said Amy, as the sun woke her next\nmorning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had\nsaid nothing about Tuesday, for her interest, like her cake, was getting\na little stale.\"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad to-day,\"\nsaid Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of\nplacid despair.\"Use the chicken, then; the toughness won't matter in a salad,\" advised\nhis wife.\"Hannah left it on the kitchen-table a minute, and the kittens got at\nit. I'm very sorry, Amy,\" added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.\"Then I _must_ have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,\" said Amy\ndecidedly.\"Shall I rush into town and demand one?\" asked Jo, with the magnanimity\nof a martyr."

I'll go myself,\" answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to\nfail.Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel travelling-basket, she\ndeparted, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit, and\nfit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her\ndesire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing, to prevent further\nloss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her own\nforethought.As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,\nAmy pocketed her veil, and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to\nfind out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card\nfull of refractory figures that she did not observe a new-comer, who\nentered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,\n\"Good-morning, Miss March,\" and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's\nmost elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he would get out\nbefore she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and,\ncongratulating herself that she had on her new travelling dress,\nreturned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.They got on excellently; for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by\nlearning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away\nin a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling to\nthe door, she upset the basket, and--oh, horror!--the lobster, in all\nits vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a\nTudor.\"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!\" cried the unconscious youth,\npoking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing\nto hand out the basket after the old lady.\"Please don't--it's--it's mine,\" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red\nas her fish.[Illustration: Please don't, it's mine]\"Oh, really, I beg pardon; it's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?\" said\nTudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that\ndid credit to his breeding.Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,\nand said, laughing,--"

Feeling that the neighbors were interested\nin her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday's\nfailure by a grand success to-day; so she ordered the \"cherry-bounce,\"\nand drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.\"There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go into the porch to meet\nthem; it looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time\nafter all her trouble,\" said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word.\nBut after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression,\nfor, looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.\"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table; it will\nbe too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,\" cried\nJo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even for a\nlaugh."

The remodelled lunch being gayly partaken of, the\nstudio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy\nordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce!) and drove her\nfriend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when \"the party went\nout.\"As she came walking in, looking very tired, but as composed as ever, she\nobserved that every vestige of the unfortunate _fête_ had disappeared,\nexcept a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.\"You've had a lovely afternoon for your drive, dear,\" said her mother,\nas respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.\"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I\nthought,\" observed Beth, with unusual warmth.\"Could you spare me some of your cake?

Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would\nhave given more real happiness than did the little sum that came to her\nin this wise.Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her\nscribbling suit, and \"fall into a vortex,\" as she expressed it, writing\naway at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was\nfinished she could find no peace. Her \"scribbling suit\" consisted of a\nblack woollen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a\ncap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which\nshe bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap\nwas a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these\nperiods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads\nsemi-occasionally, to ask, with interest, \"Does genius burn, Jo?\" They\ndid not always venture even to ask this question, but took an\nobservation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive\narticle of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that\nhard work was going on; in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly\naskew; and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and\ncast upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew; and\nnot until the red bow was seen gayly erect upon the gifted brow, did any\none dare address Jo."

Sleep forsook her eyes, meals stood\nuntasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which\nblessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth living, even\nif they bore no other fruit. The divine afflatus usually lasted a week\nor two, and then she emerged from her \"vortex,\" hungry, sleepy, cross,\nor despondent.She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed\nupon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for her virtue\nwas rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's Course, the lecture on\nthe Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for\nsuch an audience, but took it for granted that some great social evil\nwould be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories\nof the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price\nof coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder\nriddles than that of the Sphinx.They were early; and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, Jo\namused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the\nseat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads,\nand bonnets to match, discussing Woman's Rights and making tatting.\nBeyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the\nhand, a sombre spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an\nold gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On\nher right, her only neighbor was a studious-looking lad absorbed in a\nnewspaper.It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,\nidly wondering what unfortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed\nthe melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume, tumbling\nover a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young\ngentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each\nother close by, and a dishevelled female was flying away in the\nbackground with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw\nher looking, and, with boyish good-nature, offered half his paper,\nsaying bluntly, \"Want to read it? That's a first-rate story.\""

By the time the lecture ended and the\naudience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not the\nfirst founded upon paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her\nstory, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the\nelopement or after the murder."
