He brought\nthe flowers himself; and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure\nwhat was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away,\nhearing the frolic, and evidently having none of his own.\"\"It's a mercy you didn't, mother!\" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.\n\"But we'll have another play, some time, that he _can_ see. Perhaps\nhe'll help act; wouldn't that be jolly?\"\"I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!\" And Meg\nexamined her flowers with great interest.\"They _are_ lovely! But Beth's roses are sweeter to me,\" said Mrs.\nMarch, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \"I wish I could send my\nbunch to father.

This was Jo's favorite refuge; and here she loved to retire with\nhalf a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society\nof a pet rat who lived near by, and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg\nappeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her\ncheeks, and waited to hear the news.\"Such fun! only see! a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for\nto-morrow night!\" cried Meg, waving the precious paper, and then\nproceeding to read it, with girlish delight.\"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a\nlittle dance on New-Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go; now\nwhat _shall_ we wear?\"\"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins,\nbecause we haven't got anything else?\" answered Jo, with her mouth full.\"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg. \"Mother says I may when I'm\neighteen, perhaps; but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\""

I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee\nwill lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and\nmy gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.\"\"Mine are spoilt with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I shall\nhave to go without,\" said Jo, who never troubled herself much about\ndress.\"You _must_ have gloves, or I won't go,\" cried Meg decidedly. \"Gloves\nare more important than anything else; you can't dance without them, and\nif you don't I should be _so_ mortified.\"\"Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing; it's no\nfun to go sailing round; I like to fly about and cut capers.\"\"You can't ask mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are\nso careless.

I don't care what people say!\" cried Jo, taking\nup her book.\"You may have it, you may! only don't stain it, and do behave nicely.\nDon't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say 'Christopher\nColumbus!' will you?\"\"Don't worry about me; I'll be as prim as I can, and not get into any\nscrapes, if I can help it.

Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch\nthe papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.[Illustration: Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks]\"Ought they to smoke like that?\" asked Beth, from her perch on the bed.\"It's the dampness drying,\" replied Jo.\"What a queer smell! it's like burnt feathers,\" observed Amy, smoothing\nher own pretty curls with a superior air.\"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little\nringlets,\" said Jo, putting down the tongs.She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the\nhair came with the papers, and the horrified hair-dresser laid a row of\nlittle scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.\"Oh, oh, oh! what _have_ you done? I'm spoilt! I can't go! My hair, oh,\nmy hair!\" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her\nforehead.\"Just my luck! you shouldn't have asked me to do it; I always spoil\neverything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made a\nmess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the black pancakes with tears of\nregret.\"It isn't spoilt; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come\non your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I've\nseen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.\"Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone,\"\ncried Meg petulantly.\"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,\"\nsaid Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep."

Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one\nsoiled one, and all pronounced the effect \"quite easy and fine.\" Meg's\nhigh-heeled slippers were very tight, and hurt her, though she would not\nown it, and Jo's nineteen hair-pins all seemed stuck straight into her\nhead, which was not exactly comfortable; but, dear me, let us be elegant\nor die!\"Have a good time, dearies!\" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\ndaintily down the walk. \"Don't eat much supper, and come away at eleven,\nwhen I send Hannah for you.\" As the gate clashed behind them, a voice\ncried from a window,--\"Girls, girls! _have_ you both got nice pocket-handkerchiefs?\"\"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\" cried Jo, adding,\nwith a laugh, as they went on, \"I do believe Marmee would ask that if we\nwere all running away from an earthquake.\"\"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady\nis always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\" replied Meg,\nwho had a good many little \"aristocratic tastes\" of her own.\"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo.

If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind\nme by a wink, will you?\" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her\nhead a hasty brush.\"No, winking isn't lady-like; I'll lift my eyebrows if anything is\nwrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulders straight,\nand take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to any\none: it isn't the thing.\"\"How _do_ you learn all the proper ways? I never can.

  "content": "Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties,\nand, informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them.\nMrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly, and handed them\nover to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie, and was at her\nease very soon; but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish\ngossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt\nas much out of place as a colt in a flower-garden. Half a dozen jovial\nlads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she\nlonged to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.\nShe telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly\nthat she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the\ngroup near her dwindled away, till she was left alone. She could not\nroam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she\nstared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked\nat once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would\nhave guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big\nred-headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage\nher, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy\nherself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the\nsame refuge; for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face\nto face with the \"Laurence boy.\"[Illustration: Face to face with the Laurence boy]\"Dear me, I didn't know any one was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to\nback out as speedily as she had bounced in.But the boy laughed, and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\nstartled,--\"Don't mind me; stay, if you like.\"\"Sha'n't I disturb you?\"\"Not a bit; I only came here because I don't know many people, and felt\nrather strange at first, you know.\"\"So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.\"The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\nbe polite and easy,--\"I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before; you live near us,\ndon't you?\"\"Next door\"; and he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner\nwas rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket\nwhen he brought the cat home.That put Jo at her ease; and she laughed too, as she said, in her\nheartiest way,--\"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.\"\"Grandpa sent it.\"\"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?\"\"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober,\nwhile his black eyes shone with fun.\"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo,\"\nreturned the young lady.\"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.\"\"Laurie Laurence,--what an odd name!\"\"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called\nme Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\"\"I hate my name, too--so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo,\ninstead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"\"I thrashed 'em.\"\"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it\"; and\nJo resigned herself with a sigh.\"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he\nthought the name suited her."

Don't you dance?\"\"Sometimes; you see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been\ninto company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"\"Abroad!\" cried Jo. \"Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people\ndescribe their travels.\"Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin; but Jo's eager questions soon\nset him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where\nthe boys never wore hats, and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for\nholiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.\"Don't I wish I'd been there!\" cried Jo. \"Did you go to Paris?\"\"We spent last winter there.\"\"Can you talk French?\"\"We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay.\"\"Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce.\"\"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\" said Laurie\ngood-naturedly.\"How nicely you do it!

Do you think she is\npretty?\"\"Yes; she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and\nquiet, and dances like a lady.\"Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and\nstored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticised and chatted,\ntill they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore\noff; for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\nJo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten, and nobody\nlifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the \"Laurence boy\" better than\never, and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\nto the girls; for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\nwere almost unknown creatures to them.\"Curly black hair; brown skin; big, black eyes; handsome nose; fine\nteeth; small hands and feet; taller than I am; very polite, for a boy,\nand altogether jolly.

The hall was\nempty, and they had a grand polka; for Laurie danced well, and taught\nher the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring.\nWhen the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath;\nand Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students' festival at\nHeidelberg, when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and\nJo reluctantly followed her into a side-room, where she found her on a\nsofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.[Illustration: They sat down on the stairs]\"I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned, and gave me a sad\nwrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm ever\ngoing to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry. But I\ndon't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all\nnight,\" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\"I can't have a carriage, without its costing ever so much. I dare say I\ncan't get one at all; for most people come in their own, and it's a long\nway to the stable, and no one to send.\"\"I'll go.\"\"No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop here, for\nthe house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll rest\ntill Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\"\"I'll ask Laurie; he will go,\" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea\noccurred to her.\"Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell any one. Get me my rubbers, and put these\nslippers with our things. I can't dance any more; but as soon as supper\nis over, watch for Hannah, and tell me the minute she comes.\"\"They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you; I'd rather.\"\"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired, I can't\nstir!\"So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away\nto the dining-room, which she found after going into a china-closet, and\nopening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little\nprivate refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee,\nwhich she immediately spilt, thereby making the front of her dress as\nbad as the back.\"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's glove\nby scrubbing her gown with it.\"Can I help you?\" said a friendly voice; and there was Laurie, with a\nfull cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other."

I don't offer to take it\nmyself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\"Jo led the way; and, as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a\nlittle table, brought a second instalment of coffee and ice for Jo, and\nwas so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a \"nice boy.\"\nThey had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the\nmidst of a quiet game of \"Buzz,\" with two or three other young people\nwho had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot, and rose\nso quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation\nof pain.\"Hush! Don't say anything,\" she whispered, adding aloud, \"It's nothing.\nI turned my foot a little, that's all\"; and limped up-stairs to put her\nthings on.Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she\ndecided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down,\nand, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It\nhappened to be a hired waiter, who knew nothing about the neighborhood;\nand Jo was looking round for help, when Laurie, who had heard what she\nsaid, came up, and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just\ncome for him, he said.\"It's so early! You can't mean to go yet?\" began Jo, looking relieved,\nbut hesitating to accept the offer.\"I always go early,--I do, truly! Please let me take you home? It's all\non my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\"That settled it; and, telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully\naccepted, and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah\nhated rain as much as a cat does; so she made no trouble, and they\nrolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and\nelegant.

I'm sure Aunt\nMarch is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've\nlearned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so\nlight that I sha'n't mind her.\"This idea tickled Jo's fancy, and put her in good spirits; but Meg\ndidn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoilt children,\nseemed heavier than ever. She hadn't heart enough even to make herself\npretty, as usual, by putting on a blue neck-ribbon, and dressing her\nhair in the most becoming way.\"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross\nmidgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?\" she muttered,\nshutting her drawer with a jerk. \"I shall have to toil and moil all my\ndays, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly\nand sour, because I'm poor, and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.\nIt's a shame!\"So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable\nat breakfast-time. Every one seemed rather out of sorts, and inclined to\ncroak. Beth had a headache, and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort\nherself with the cat and three kittens; Amy was fretting because her\nlessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers; Jo _would_\nwhistle and make a great racket getting ready; Mrs. March was very busy\ntrying to finish a letter, which must go at once; and Hannah had the\ngrumps, for being up late didn't suit her."

Now then, Meg!\" and Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims\nwere not setting out as they ought to do.They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\nalways at the window, to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\nSomehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without\nthat; for, whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\nmotherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.\"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would\nserve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never\nseen,\" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and\nbitter wind."

Believing that they could not begin too\nearly to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents\nconsented, and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in\nspite of all obstacles, is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a\nplace as nursery governess, and felt rich with her small salary. As she\nsaid, she _was_ \"fond of luxury,\" and her chief trouble was poverty. She\nfound it harder to bear than the others, because she could remember a\ntime when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want\nof any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it\nwas very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay\nfriends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw\nall she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg\ncaught frequent glimpses of dainty ball-dresses and bouquets, heard\nlively gossip about theatres, concerts, sleighing parties, and\nmerry-makings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which\nwould have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a\nsense of injustice made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes, for\nshe had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which\nalone can make life happy.Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame, and needed an active\nperson to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one\nof the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her\noffer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost\nall chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will; but the\nunworldly Marches only said,--\"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will\nkeep together and be happy in one another.\"The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo\nat a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck\nthe old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This\ndid not suit Jo at all; but she accepted the place since nothing better\nappeared, and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well with her\nirascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo had\nmarched home, declaring she couldn't bear it any longer; but Aunt March\nalways cleared up quickly, and sent for her back again with such urgency\nthat she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery\nold lady."

Jo remembered\nthe kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges\nwith his big dictionaries, tell her stories about the queer pictures in\nhis Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in\nthe street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the\ntall book-cases, the cosy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the\nwilderness of books, in which she could wander where she liked, made the\nlibrary a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap, or\nwas busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling\nherself up in the easy-chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,\ntravels, and pictures, like a regular book-worm. But, like all\nhappiness, it did not last long; for as sure as she had just reached the\nheart of the story, the sweetest verse of the song, or the most perilous\nadventure of her traveller, a shrill voice called, \"Josy-phine!\nJosy-phine!\" and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the\npoodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.[Illustration: Curling herself up in the big chair]Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid; what it was she had no\nidea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her; and, meanwhile, found\nher greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and\nride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless\nspirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series\nof ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training\nshe received at Aunt March's was just what she needed; and the thought\nthat she was doing something to support herself made her happy, in spite\nof the perpetual \"Josy-phine!\""

Even when he went away, and her mother was called to\ndevote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went\nfaithfully on by herself, and did the best she could. She was a\nhousewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and\ncomfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be\nloved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little\nworld was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy\nbee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for\nBeth was a child still, and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one\nwhole or handsome one among them; all were outcasts till Beth took them\nin; for, when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her,\nbecause Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the\nmore tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm\ndolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals; no harsh words\nor blows were ever given them; no neglect ever saddened the heart of the\nmost repulsive: but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed, with\nan affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of _dollanity_ had\nbelonged to Jo; and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in\nthe rag-bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth, and\ntaken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat\nlittle cap, and, as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these\ndeficiencies by folding it in a blanket, and devoting her best bed to\nthis chronic invalid. If any one had known the care lavished on that\ndolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they\nlaughed. She brought it bits of bouquets; she read to it, took it out to\nbreathe the air, hidden under her coat; she sung it lullabys, and never\nwent to bed without kissing its dirty face, and whispering tenderly, \"I\nhope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.\""

She loved\nmusic so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practised away so patiently\nat the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if some one (not to\nhint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw\nBeth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune,\nwhen she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work,\nnever was too tired to play for Marmee and the girls, and day after day\nsaid hopefully to herself, \"I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm\ngood.\"There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners\ntill needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the\nsacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the\nsweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she\nwould have answered at once, \"My nose.\" When she was a baby, Jo had\naccidentally dropped her into the coal-hod, and Amy insisted that the\nfall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big, nor red, like poor\n\"Petrea's\"; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world\ncould not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,\nand it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a\nGrecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself."

Her\nteachers complained that, instead of doing her sums, she covered her\nslate with animals; the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps\non; and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering\nout of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as\nwell as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of\ndeportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being\ngood-tempered, and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.\nHer little airs and graces were much admired, so were her\naccomplishments; for beside her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,\ncrochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two thirds of\nthe words. She had a plaintive way of saying, \"When papa was rich we did\nso-and-so,\" which was very touching; and her long words were considered\n\"perfectly elegant\" by the girls.Amy was in a fair way to be spoilt; for every one petted her, and her\nsmall vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,\nhowever, rather quenched the vanities; she had to wear her cousin's\nclothes. Now Florence's mamma hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy\nsuffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,\nunbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was\ngood, well made, and little worn; but Amy's artistic eyes were much\nafflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull\npurple, with yellow dots, and no trimming.\"My only comfort,\" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \"is, that\nmother don't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria\nParks' mother does.

To Jo alone did the shy child tell her\nthoughts; and over her big, harum-scarum sister, Beth unconsciously\nexercised more influence than any one in the family. The two older girls\nwere a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger into\nher keeping, and watched over her in her own way; \"playing mother\" they\ncalled it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls, with\nthe maternal instinct of little women.\"Has anybody got anything to tell?

I actually made myself sleepy; and, before she\nbegan to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by\nopening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.[Illustration: Reading that everlasting Belsham]\"'I wish I could, and be done with it,' said I, trying not to be saucy.\"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and\nthink them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never\nfinds herself very soon; so the minute her cap began to bob, like a\ntop-heavy dahlia, I whipped the 'Vicar of Wakefield' out of my pocket,\nand read away, with one eye on him, and one on aunt.

A poor woman came\nin, with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do\nsome scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her\nchildren, and had been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a\nhurry, and said 'No,' rather crossly; so she was going away, looking\nhungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the\ncrooked end of his cane, and held it out to her.

Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,\nslippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy.'\"[Illustration: Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish]When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one;\nand, after a moment's thought, she said soberly,--\"As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets to-day, at the rooms, I felt\nvery anxious about father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should\nbe, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do; but I\nkept on worrying, till an old man came in, with an order for some\nclothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him; for he looked\npoor and tired and anxious.\"'Have you sons in the army?' I asked; for the note he brought was not\nto me.\"'Yes, ma'am.

I had all my girls\nto comfort me at home; and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say\n'good by' to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy, thinking of my\nblessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and\nthanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.\"\"Tell another story, mother,--one with a moral to it, like this.
