  "content": "News from their father comforted the girls very much; for, though\ndangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had\nalready done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and, as the\nhead of the family, Meg insisted on reading the despatches, which grew\nmore and more cheering as the week passed. At first, every one was eager\nto write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter-box\nby one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their\nWashington correspondence. As one of these packets contained\ncharacteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and\nread them:--\"MY DEAREST MOTHER,--\"It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made\n    us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and\n    crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate\n    that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long,\n    since he is so useful to you and father. The girls are all as\n    good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing\n    all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if\n    I didn't know that her 'moral fit' wouldn't last long. Beth is\n    as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what\n    you told her. She grieves about father, and looks sober except\n    when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I\n    take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am\n    teaching her to make button-holes and mend her stockings. She\n    tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her\n    improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a\n    motherly old hen, as Jo says; and Laurie is very kind and\n    neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue\n    sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah\n    is a perfect saint; she does not scold at all, and always calls\n    me Miss 'Margaret,' which is quite proper, you know, and treats\n    me with respect. We are all well and busy; but we long, day\n    and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to father,\n    and believe me, ever your own\n                                                              \"MEG.\"This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to\nthe next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper,\nornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed\nletters:--\"MY PRECIOUS MARMEE,--"

I rushed\n    up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank God for\n    being so good to us; but I could only cry, and say, 'I'm glad!\n    I'm glad!' Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? for I\n    felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times; and\n    now I can enjoy them, for every one is so desperately good,\n    it's like living in a nest of turtle-doves. You'd laugh to see\n    Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier\n    every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are\n    regular archangels, and I--well, I'm Jo, and never shall be\n    anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a\n    quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little\n    thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I\n    ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till\n    I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't, and got mad. It lasted\n    all day; I felt bad, and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are\n    both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon; but I thought he'd come\n    to it, for I _was_ in the right. He didn't come; and just at\n    night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river.\n    I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun\n    set on _my_ anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I\n    met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both\n    laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and\n    comfortable again.\"I made a 'pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash; and,\n    as father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse\n    him.

Jo liked this, and\nafter an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa\nto nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that housework and\nart did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went\ndaily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much\ntime was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the\nWashington despatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight\nrelapses into idleness or grieving. All the little duties were\nfaithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were\nforgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone\na-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears\nfor father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the\nfolds of a certain dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed\nher little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up\nafter a sober fit, but every one felt how sweet and helpful Beth was,\nand fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small\naffairs.All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character; and,\nwhen the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well, and\ndeserved praise. So they did; but their mistake was in ceasing to do\nwell, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.\"Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels; you know mother told us not\nto forget them,\" said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's departure.\"I'm too tired to go this afternoon,\" replied Meg, rocking comfortably\nas she sewed.\"Can't you, Jo?\" asked Beth.\"Too stormy for me with my cold.\"\"I thought it was almost well.\"\"It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to\ngo to the Hummels',\" said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of\nher inconsistency.\"Why don't you go yourself?\" asked Meg.\"I _have_ been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't know what to\ndo for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of it;\nbut it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to go.\"Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go to-morrow.\"Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth; the air\nwill do you good,\" said Jo, adding apologetically, \"I'd go, but I want\nto finish my writing.\"\"My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought may be some of you would go,\"\nsaid Beth.\"Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,\" suggested Meg.\"Well, I'll rest a little and wait for her.\""

An hour passed: Amy did not come; Meg went to\nher room to try on a new dress; Jo was absorbed in her story, and Hannah\nwas sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her\nhood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and\nwent out into the chilly air, with a heavy head, and a grieved look in\nher patient eyes. It was late when she came back, and no one saw her\ncreep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room. Half an hour\nafter Jo went to \"mother's closet\" for something, and there found Beth\nsitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes, and a\ncamphor-bottle in her hand.\"Christopher Columbus! What's the matter?\" cried Jo, as Beth put out her\nhand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly,--\"You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?\"\"Years ago, when Meg did. Why?\"\"Then I'll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!\"\"What baby?\"\"Mrs. Hummel's; it died in my lap before she got home,\" cried Beth, with\na sob.\"My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone,\" said Jo,\ntaking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's big chair,\nwith a remorseful face.\"It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute that it was\nsicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took\nbaby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden it gave a\nlittle cry, and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its\nfeet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was\ndead.\"[Illustration: It didn't stir, and I knew it was dead]\"Don't cry, dear! What did you do?\"\"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor. He\nsaid it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have got sore\nthroats. 'Scarlet fever, ma'am. Ought to have called me before,' he said\ncrossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure baby\nherself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the\nothers, and trust to charity for his pay. He smiled then, and was\nkinder; but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned round,\nall of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right away,\nor I'd have the fever.\"\"No, you won't!\" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look. \"O\nBeth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What _shall_\nwe do?\"\"Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked in\nmother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and\nqueer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel\nbetter,\" said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead, and\ntrying to look well."

She read a page, looked\nat Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said gravely;\n\"You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and among the\nothers who are going to have it; so I'm afraid _you_ are going to have\nit, Beth. I'll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.\"\"Don't let Amy come; she never had it, and I should hate to give it to\nher. Can't you and Meg have it over again?\" asked Beth, anxiously.\"I guess not; don't care if I do; serve me right, selfish pig, to let\nyou go, and stay writing rubbish myself!\" muttered Jo, as she went to\nconsult Hannah.The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,\nassuring Jo that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet\nfever, and, if rightly treated, nobody died,--all of which Jo believed,\nand felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.\"Now I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Hannah, when she had examined\nand questioned Beth; \"we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at\nyou, dear, and see that we start right; then we'll send Amy off to Aunt\nMarch's, for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you\ngirls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.\"\"I shall stay, of course; I'm oldest,\" began Meg, looking anxious and\nself-reproachful.\"_I_ shall, because it's my fault she is sick; I told mother I'd do the\nerrands, and I haven't,\" said Jo decidedly.\"Which will you have, Beth? there ain't no need of but one,\" said\nHannah.\"Jo, please;\" and Beth leaned her head against her sister, with a\ncontented look, which effectually settled that point.\"I'll go and tell Amy,\" said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather\nrelieved, on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did."

She told her story, expecting to be consoled; but\nLaurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,\nwhistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought.

The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.\nLaurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything all her\nown way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the\nexcellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,\nand kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote\nletters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. She could not\nthink it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind\nHannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of \"Mrs. March bein' told, and worried\njust for sech a trifle.\" Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night; not a\nhard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly\nas long as she could control herself. But there came a time when during\nthe fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on\nthe coverlet, as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a\nthroat so swollen that there was no music left; a time when she did not\nknow the familiar faces round her, but addressed them by wrong names,\nand called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg\nbegged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she \"would\nthink of it, though there was no danger _yet_.\" A letter from Washington\nadded to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not\nthink of coming home for a long while.How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how\nheavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while\nthe shadow of death hovered over the once happy home! Then it was that\nMargaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how\nrich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could\nbuy,--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of\nlife. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that\nsuffering little sister always before her eyes, and that pathetic voice\nsounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of\nBeth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all\nhearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition, to\nlive for others, and make home happy by the exercise of those simple\nvirtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more\nthan talent, wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to\nbe at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service\nwould be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how\nmany neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie\nhaunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the\ngrand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young\nneighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. Every one\nmissed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she\ndid; poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness, and to\nget a shroud for Minna; the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and\ngood wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how\nmany friends shy little Beth had made."

She longed for\nher cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick;\nand, in her quiet hours, she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent\nloving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write\nsoon; and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that\nfather might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these\nintervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing\nto and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy\nsleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,\nHannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to\nsend off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind\nblew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death.\nWhen Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot\nhand in both his own a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low\ntone, to Hannah,--\"If Mrs. March _can_ leave her husband, she'd better be sent for.\"Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously; Meg\ndropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs\nat the sound of those words; and Jo, after standing with a pale face for\na minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and, throwing on\nher things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon back, and, while\nnoiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying\nthat Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy\nweight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of\nmisery that Laurie asked quickly,--\"What is it? is Beth worse?\"\"I've sent for mother,\" said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a\ntragical expression.\"Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?\" asked\nLaurie, as he seated her in the hall chair, and took off the rebellious\nboots, seeing how her hands shook.\"No, the doctor told us to.\"\"O Jo, it's not so bad as that?\" cried Laurie, with a startled face.\"Yes, it is; she doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the\nflocks of green doves, as she calls the vine-leaves on the wall; she\ndoesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it; mother\nand father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find Him.\"As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her\nhand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie\ntook it in his, whispering, as well as he could, with a lump in his\nthroat,--\"I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!\""

It was the best thing he could have done; far\nmore soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken\nsympathy, and, in the silence, learned the sweet solace which affection\nadministers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her,\nand looked up with a grateful face.[Illustration: Gently stroking her head as her mother used to do]\"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now; I don't feel so forlorn, and will try\nto bear it if it comes.\"\"Keep hoping for the best; that will help you, Jo.

Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of\nmind; he patted her back soothingly, and, finding that she was\nrecovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo\nround at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away,\nsaying breathlessly, \"Oh, don't!

She felt her exile deeply, and, for the first time in her\nlife, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March\nnever petted any one; she did not approve of it; but she meant to be\nkind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt\nMarch had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children,\nthough she didn't think proper to confess it. She really did her best to\nmake Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made! Some old people\nkeep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize\nwith children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can\nhide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship\nin the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried\nAmy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy\ntalks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the\nold lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the\nbad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy in hand, and\ntaught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago,--a process\nwhich carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made her feel like a fly in the\nweb of a very strict spider.[Illustration: Polish up the spoons and the fat silver teapot]"

Then Polly must be fed, the\nlap-dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down, to get things, or\ndeliver orders, for the old lady was very lame, and seldom left her big\nchair. After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a\ndaily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour\nfor exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it? Laurie came every day,\nand wheedled Aunt March, till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when\nthey walked and rode, and had capital times. After dinner, she had to\nread aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually\ndid for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork\nor towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward\nrebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked\ntill tea-time. The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell\nto telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull\nthat Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard\nfate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a\ntear or two.If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that\nshe never could have got through that dreadful time.

She also\nallowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and\npretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests;\nfor Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy's chief delight was an Indian\ncabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeon-holes, and secret places,\nin which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely\ncurious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things\ngave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel-cases, in which, on\nvelvet cushions, reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty\nyears ago.

Say nothing to Madame, but\nwhen she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and\npray the dear God to preserve your sister.\"Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice; for she had an\naffectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety.
