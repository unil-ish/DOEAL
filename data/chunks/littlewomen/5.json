One July day she came in with her hands full,\nand went about the house leaving letters and parcels, like the penny\npost.\"Here's your posy, mother! Laurie never forgets that,\" she said, putting\nthe fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \"Marmee's corner,\" and was\nkept supplied by the affectionate boy.\"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\" continued Beth, delivering the\narticles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.\"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\" said Meg, looking\nat the gray cotton glove.\"Didn't you drop the other in the garden?\"\"No, I'm sure I didn't; for there was only one in the office.\""

Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she\npinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she\nbe taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready\nfor either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote,--\"DEAR JO,\n                 What ho!Some English girls and boys are coming to see me to-morrow and\n    I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch\n    my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and\n    croquet,--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all\n    sorts of larks.

Each had made such preparation\nfor the fÃªte as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of\nlittle curl-papers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her\nafflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to\natone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by\nputting a clothes-pin on her nose, to uplift the offending feature. It\nwas one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their\ndrawing-boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the\npurpose to which it was now put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse\nthe sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up, and\nroused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.[Illustration: Amy capped the climax by putting a clothes-pin on her\n                                 nose]Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a\nlively bustle began in both houses.

The lawn was the reception-room, and for several minutes a\nlively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate,\nthough twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would\ndo well to imitate; and she was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances\nthat he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie \"primmed up\nhis mouth\" when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a\nstand-off-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free\nand easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the\nnew boys, and decided that the lame one was not \"dreadful,\" but gentle\nand feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found\nGrace a well-mannered, merry little person; and after staring dumbly at\none another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends."

Laurie and Jo rowed one boat;\nMr. Brooke and Ned the other; while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did\nhis best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed\nwater-bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of\ngeneral utility; it broke the ice in the beginning, by producing a\nlaugh; it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro, as she\nrowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a\nshower came up, she said. Kate looked rather amazed at Jo's proceedings,\nespecially as she exclaimed \"Christopher Columbus!\" when she lost her\noar; and Laurie said, \"My dear fellow, did I hurt you?\" when he tripped\nover her feet in taking his place. But after putting up her glass to\nexamine the queer girl several times, Miss Kate decided that she was\n\"odd, but rather clever,\" and smiled upon her from afar.[Illustration: Mr. Laurence waving his hat]Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the\nrowers, who both admired the prospect, and feathered their oars with\nuncommon \"skill and dexterity.\" Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\nman, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet\nmanners, and considered him a walking encyclopÃ¦dia of useful knowledge.\nHe never talked to her much; but he looked at her a good deal, and she\nfelt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in\ncollege, of course put on all the airs which Freshmen think it their\nbounden duty to assume; he was not very wise, but very good-natured, and\naltogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.

The Englishers played well; but the Americans played\nbetter, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the\nspirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes, and\nonce narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket, and\nhad missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was\nclose behind her, and his turn came before hers; he gave a stroke, his\nball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was\nvery near; and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\ntoe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\"I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\nthe young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.[Illustration: Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you]\"You pushed it; I saw you; it's my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\"Upon my word, I didn't move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\nallowed; so stand off, please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\nangrily.\"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!\"\nreturned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,\ncolored up to her forehead, and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\nwith all her might, while Fred hit the stake, and declared himself out\nwith much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time\nfinding it, among the bushes; but she came back, looking cool and quiet,\nand waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the\nplace she had lost; and, when she got there, the other side had nearly\nwon, for Kate's ball was the last but one, and lay near the stake.\"By George, it's all up with us! Good-by, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so\nyou are finished,\" cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see\nthe finish.\"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\" said Jo, with\na look that made the lad redden, \"especially when they beat them,\" she\nadded, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a clever\nstroke.Laurie threw up his hat; then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult\nover the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of a cheer to\nwhisper to his friend,--\"Good for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him; we can't tell him so, but he\nwon't do it again, take my word for it.\"Meg drew her aside, under pretence of pinning up a loose braid, and said\napprovingly,--\"It was dreadfully provoking; but you kept your temper, and I'm so glad,\nJo.\""

So Jo, feeling that\nher late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over\nthe coffee-pot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys\nmade a fire, and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched,\nand Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes\nto serve as plates.The commander-in-chief and his aids soon spread the table-cloth with an\ninviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green\nleaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and every one settled\nthemselves to a hearty meal; for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise\ndevelops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was; for everything\nseemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a\nvenerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the\ntable, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates; acorns dropped\ninto the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without\nbeing invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree, to see\nwhat was going on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence,\nand an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river\nwith all his might and main.[Illustration: \"A very merry lunch it was.\"--Page 156.]\"There's salt here, if you prefer it,\" said Laurie, as he handed Jo a\nsaucer of berries.\"Thank you, I prefer spiders,\" she replied, fishing up two unwary little\nones who had gone to a creamy death. \"How dare you remind me of that\nhorrid dinner-party, when yours is so nice in every way?\" added Jo,\nas they both laughed, and ate out of one plate, the china having run\nshort."

He travelled a long\nwhile, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he\ncame to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to any\none who would tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was\nvery fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely; for\nthe colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master,\nthough he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to\nthis pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city; and, as\nhe rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had\nseen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went\nprancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle\nthe lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old\ncastle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by\na spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The\nknight wished intensely that he could free them; but he was poor, and\ncould only go by each day, watching for the sweet face, and longing to\nsee it out in the sunshine. At last, he resolved to get into the castle\nand ask how he could help them.

Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to\na little door guarded by two stout fellows; knocked their heads together\ntill they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of\nhis prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone\nsteps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and\nspiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March.

Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his\naffections picking flowers in her garden. 'Will you give me a rose?'\nsaid he. 'You must come and get it. I can't come to you; it isn't\nproper,' said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge,\nbut it seemed to grow higher and higher; then he tried to push through,\nbut it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently\nbroke twig after twig, till he had made a little hole, through which he\npeeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in! let me in!'

The hot weather made him indolent, and he had\nshirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,\ndispleased his grandfather by practising half the afternoon, frightened\nthe maid-servants half out of their wits, by mischievously hinting that\none of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stable-man\nabout some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his\nhammock, to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the\npeace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into\nthe green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams\nof all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean, in a\nvoyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a\nflash.

Each wore a large, flapping\nhat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long\nstaff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio.\nAll walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate, and\nbegan to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.\"Well, that's cool!\" said Laurie to himself, \"to have a picnic and never\nask me.

Taking the shortest way to the boat-house, he\nwaited for them to appear: but no one came, and he went up the hill to\ntake an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from\nthe heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of\nthe pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.\"Here's a landscape!\" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and\nlooking wide-awake and good-natured already."
