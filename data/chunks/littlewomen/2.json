He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young\nand lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!\"The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things, and was always\nscandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of \"going over\" was\nnot forgotten; and when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try\nwhat could be done. She saw Mr. Laurence drive off, and then sallied out\nto dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused, and took a survey.\nAll quiet,--curtains down at the lower windows; servants out of sight,\nand nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand\nat the upper window.\"There he is,\" thought Jo, \"poor boy! all alone and sick this dismal\nday. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snow-ball, and make him look out, and\nthen say a kind word to him.\"Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a\nface which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes\nbrightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and\nflourished her broom as she called out,--\"How do you do? Are you sick?\"[Illustration: Laurie opened the window]Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven,--\"Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.\"\"I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?\"\"Nothing; it's as dull as tombs up here.\"\"Don't you read?\"\"Not much; they won't let me.\"\"Can't somebody read to you?\"\"Grandpa does, sometimes; but my books don't interest him, and I hate to\nask Brooke all the time.\"\"Have some one come and see you, then.\"\"There isn't any one I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head\nis weak.\"\"Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls are quiet,\nand like to play nurse.\"\"Don't know any.\"\"You know us,\" began Jo, then laughed, and stopped.\"So I do! Will you come, please?\" cried Laurie.\"I'm not quiet and nice; but I'll come, if mother will let me. I'll go\nask her. Shut that window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.\""

  "content": "With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering\nwhat they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at\nthe idea of having company, and flew about to get ready; for, as Mrs.\nMarch said, he was \"a little gentleman,\" and did honor to the coming\nguest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh collar, and trying\nto tidy up the room, which, in spite of half a dozen servants, was\nanything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, then a decided\nvoice, asking for \"Mr. Laurie,\" and a surprised-looking servant came\nrunning up to announce a young lady.\"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo,\" said Laurie, going to the door\nof his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and kind and\nquite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three\nkittens in the other.\"Here I am, bag and baggage,\" she said briskly. \"Mother sent her love,\nand was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some\nof her blanc-mange; she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats\nwould be comforting. I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't refuse,\nshe was so anxious to do something.\"It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing; for, in\nlaughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable\nat once.\"That looks too pretty to eat,\" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo\nuncovered the dish, and showed the blanc-mange, surrounded by a garland\nof green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.\"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly, and wanted to show it.\nTell the girl to put it away for your tea: it's so simple, you can eat\nit; and, being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.\nWhat a cosy room this is!\"\"It might be if it was kept nice; but the maids are lazy, and I don't\nknow how to make them mind. It worries me, though.\"\"I'll right it up in two minutes; for it only needs to have the hearth\nbrushed, so,--and the things made straight on the mantel-piece so,--and\nthe books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the\nlight, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now, then, you're fixed.\"And so he was; for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things\ninto place, and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched\nher in respectful silence; and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat\ndown with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully,--\"How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take the big\nchair, and let me do something to amuse my company.\""

  "content": "\"No; I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?\" and Jo looked\naffectionately toward some inviting books near by.\"Thank you; I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather\ntalk,\" answered Laurie.\"Not a bit; I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I\nnever know when to stop.\"\"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home a good deal, and sometimes goes\nout with a little basket?\" asked Laurie, with interest.\"Yes, that's Beth; she's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\"\"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\"\"How did you find that out?\"Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, \"Why, you see, I often hear you\ncalling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help looking\nover at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg\nyour pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the\ncurtain at the window where the flowers are; and when the lamps are\nlighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all\nround the table with your mother; her face is right opposite, and it\nlooks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help watching it. I haven't\ngot any mother, you know;\" and Laurie poked the fire to hide a little\ntwitching of the lips that he could not control.The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.\nShe had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,\nand at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was\nsick and lonely; and, feeling how rich she was in home-love and\nhappiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very\nfriendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said,--\"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as\nmuch as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd come\nover and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of good, and\nBeth would sing to you if _I_ begged her to, and Amy would dance; Meg\nand I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we'd\nhave jolly times. Wouldn't your grandpa let you?\""

He's very kind, though he\ndoes not look so; and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's\nafraid I might be a bother to strangers,\" began Laurie, brightening more\nand more.\"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be\na bother. We _want_ to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever\nso long. We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got\nacquainted with all our neighbors but you.\"\"You see grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what\nhappens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know, and\nI have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as\nI can.\"\"That's bad. You ought to make an effort, and go visiting everywhere you\nare asked; then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go\nto. Never mind being bashful; it won't last long if you keep going.\"Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of\nbashfulness; for there was so much good-will in Jo, it was impossible\nnot to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.\"Do you like your school?\" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a\nlittle pause, during which he stared at the fire, and Jo looked about\nher, well pleased.\"Don't go to school; I'm a business man--girl, I mean. I go to wait on\nmy great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\" answered Jo.Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question; but remembering just in\ntime that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's\naffairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable. Jo liked his good\nbreeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him\na lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot\nthat talked Spanish, and the library where she revelled. Laurie enjoyed\nthat immensely; and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came\nonce to woo Aunt March, and, in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll\nhad tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and\nlaughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head\nin to see what was the matter.[Illustration: Poll tweaked off his wig]"

  "content": "\"Oh! that does me no end of good. Tell on, please,\" he said, taking his\nface out of the sofa-cushion, red and shining with merriment.Much elated with her success, Jo did \"tell on,\" all about their plays\nand plans, their hopes and fears for father, and the most interesting\nevents of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to\ntalking about books; and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved\nthem as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\"If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandpa is out, so\nyou needn't be afraid,\" said Laurie, getting up.\"I'm not afraid of anything,\" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.\"I don't believe you are!\" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much\nadmiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be\na trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his\nmoods.The atmosphere of the whole house being summer-like, Laurie led the way\nfrom room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy;\nand so at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands,\nand pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined\nwith books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little\ncabinets full of coins and curiosities, and sleepy-hollow chairs, and\nqueer tables, and bronzes; and, best of all, a great open fireplace,\nwith quaint tiles all round it.\"What richness!\" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velvet chair,\nand gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \"Theodore\nLaurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\" she added\nimpressively.\"A fellow can't live on books,\" said Laurie, shaking his head, as he\nperched on a table opposite.Before he could say more, a bell rung, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with\nalarm, \"Mercy me! it's your grandpa!\"\"Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,\"\nreturned the boy, looking wicked."

Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse for\nit,\" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.\"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only\nafraid you are very tired talking to me; it was _so_ pleasant, I\ncouldn't bear to stop,\" said Laurie gratefully.\"The doctor to see you, sir,\" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.\"Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,\"\nsaid Laurie.\"Don't mind me. I'm as happy as a cricket here,\" answered Jo.Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was\nstanding before a fine portrait of the old gentleman, when the door\nopened again, and, without turning, she said decidedly, \"I'm sure now\nthat I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his\nmouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.\nHe isn't as handsome as _my_ grandfather, but I like him.\"\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said a gruff voice behind her; and there, to her\ngreat dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began\nto beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a\nminute a wild desire to run away possessed her; but that was cowardly,\nand the girls would laugh at her: so she resolved to stay, and get out\nof the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living\neyes, under the bushy gray eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted\nones; and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a\ngood deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman\nsaid abruptly, after that dreadful pause, \"So you're not afraid of me,\nhey?\"\"Not much, sir.\"\"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?\"\"Not quite, sir.\"\"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?\"\"I only said I thought so.\"\"But you like me, in spite of it?\"\"Yes, I do, sir.\""

He _was_ a fine\nman, my dear; but, what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and\nI was proud to be his friend.\"[Illustration: Putting his finger under her chin]\"Thank you, sir;\" and Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited\nher exactly.\"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\" was the next\nquestion, sharply put.\"Only trying to be neighborly, sir;\" and Jo told how her visit came\nabout.\"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\"\"Yes, sir; he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good\nperhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,\nfor we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\" said Jo\neagerly.\"Tut, tut, tut! that was the boy's affair. How is the poor woman?\"\"Doing nicely, sir;\" and off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all\nabout the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than\nthey were.\"Just her father's way of doing good.

Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\" said the old\ngentleman, as Laurie came running down stairs, and brought up with a\nstart of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm-in-arm with his\nredoubtable grandfather.\"I didn't know you'd come, sir,\" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant\nlittle glance.\"That's evident, by the way you racket down stairs. Come to your tea,\nsir, and behave like a gentleman;\" and having pulled the boy's hair by\nway of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a\nseries of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\nexplosion of laughter from Jo."

There was color, light,\nand life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine\nmerriment in his laugh.\"She's right; the lad _is_ lonely. I'll see what these little girls can\ndo for him,\" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked\nJo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him; and she seemed to understand the\nboy almost as well as if she had been one herself.If the Laurences had been what Jo called \"prim and poky,\" she would not\nhave got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward; but\nfinding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good\nimpression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had\nsomething more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which\nhad been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as\nshe went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either\nside, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and\ntrees that hung above her,--while her new friend cut the finest flowers\ntill his hands were full; then he tied them up, saying, with the happy\nlook Jo liked to see, \"Please give these to your mother, and tell her I\nlike the medicine she sent me very much.\"[Illustration: Please give these to your mother]They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great\ndrawing-room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano,\nwhich stood open.\"Do you play?\" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\nexpression.\"Sometimes,\" he answered modestly.\"Please do now.

Her respect and regard for the \"Laurence boy\"\nincreased very much, for he played remarkably well, and didn't put on\nany airs.

Mrs. March\nwanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him;\nMeg longed to walk in the conservatory; Beth sighed for the grand piano;\nand Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.\"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\" asked Jo,\nwho was of an inquiring disposition.\"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father,\nmarried an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who\nis very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did\nnot like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died\nwhen Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home.\nI fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old\nman is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes\nnaturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare\nsay his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician; at any\nrate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he\n'glowered,' as Jo said.\"\"Dear me, how romantic!\" exclaimed Meg.\"How silly!\" said Jo. \"Let him be a musician, if he wants to, and not\nplague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\""

  "content": "The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for\nall to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr.\nLaurence was the biggest one; but after he had called, said something\nfunny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with\ntheir mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The\nother lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich; for this\nmade them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But,\nafter a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and\ncould not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's\nmotherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in\nthat humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride, and\ninterchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time; for the new\nfriendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and\nhe privately informed his tutor that \"the Marches were regularly\nsplendid girls.\" With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the\nsolitary boy into their midst, and made much of him, and he found\nsomething very charming in the innocent companionship of these\nsimple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick\nto feel the influences they brought about him; and their busy, lively\nways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of\nbooks, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged\nto make very unsatisfactory reports; for Laurie was always playing\ntruant, and running over to the Marches.\"Never mind; let him take a holiday, and make it up afterwards,\" said\nthe old gentleman. \"The good lady next door says he is studying too\nhard, and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is\nright, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his\ngrandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can't\nget into mischief in that little nunnery over there; and Mrs. March is\ndoing more for him than we can.\"What good times they had, to be sure! Such plays and tableaux, such\nsleigh-rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old\nparlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg\ncould walk in the conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in\nbouquets; Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the\nold gentleman with her criticisms; Amy copied pictures, and enjoyed\nbeauty to her heart's content; and Laurie played \"lord of the manor\" in\nthe most delightful style."

No persuasions or enticements\ncould overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in\nsome mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the\nbrief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and\ntalked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had\nheard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to\nstay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if\nfascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped, and stood listening,\nwith her great eyes wide open, and her cheeks red with the excitement of\nthis unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had\nbeen a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's lessons and teachers;\nand presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs.\nMarch,--\"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting\ntoo fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn't some of\nyour girls like to run over, and practise on it now and then, just to\nkeep it in tune, you know, ma'am?\"Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep\nfrom clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation; and the\nthought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath\naway. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd\nlittle nod and smile,--\"They needn't see or speak to any one, but run in at any time; for I'm\nshut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great\ndeal, and the servants are never near the drawing-room after nine\no'clock.\"Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that\nlast arrangement left nothing to be desired. \"Please tell the young\nladies what I say; and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.\"\nHere a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a\nface full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way,--\"O sir, they do care, very, very much!\"[Illustration: O sir, they do care very much]\"Are you the musical girl?\" he asked, without any startling \"Hey!\" as he\nlooked down at her very kindly.\"I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure nobody\nwill hear me--and be disturbed,\" she added, fearing to be rude, and\ntrembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\"Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day; so come, and drum\naway as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\"\"How kind you are, sir!\"Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was\nnot frightened now, and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze, because\nshe had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.\nThe old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,\nstooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard,--"

Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of\nthe house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the\nside-door, and made her way, as noiselessly as any mouse, to the\ndrawing-room, where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some\npretty, easy music lay on the piano; and, with trembling fingers, and\nfrequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great\ninstrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything\nelse but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was\nlike the voice of a beloved friend.She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner; but she had no\nappetite, and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general state\nof beatitude.After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every\nday, and the great drawing-room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that\ncame and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence often opened his\nstudy-door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked; she never saw Laurie\nmount guard in the hall to warn the servants away; she never suspected\nthat the exercise-books and new songs which she found in the rack were\nput there for her especial benefit; and when he talked to her about\nmusic at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that\nhelped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what\nisn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.\nPerhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a\ngreater was given her; at any rate, she deserved both.[Illustration: Mr. Laurence often opened his study door]"

Can I do\nit?\" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\"Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking\nhim. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making\nup,\" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth's\nrequests, because she so seldom asked anything for herself.After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,\nthe materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet\ncheerful pansies, on a deeper purple ground, was pronounced very\nappropriate and pretty; and Beth worked away early and late, with\noccasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needle-woman,\nand they were finished before any one got tired of them. Then she wrote\na very short, simple note, and, with Laurie's help, got them smuggled on\nto the study-table one morning before the old gentleman was up.When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All\nthat day passed, and a part of the next, before any acknowledgment\narrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety\nfriend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an\nerrand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As\nshe came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four, heads\npopping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\nseveral hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed,--\"Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!\"\"O Beth, he's sent you--\" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy;\nbut she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door, her sisters\nseized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\npointing, and all saying at once, \"Look there! look there!\" Beth did\nlook, and turned pale with delight and surprise; for there stood a\nlittle cabinet-piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed,\nlike a sign-board, to \"Miss Elizabeth March.\""

I wish some one would write to me so!\" said Amy,\nwho thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.\"'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had\n    any that suited me so well as yours,'\" continued Jo.\n    \"'Heart's-ease is my favorite flower, and these will always\n    remind me of the gentle giver.

Just think, he's given you her piano.\nThat comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\" said Jo, trying to\nsoothe Beth, who trembled, and looked more excited than she had ever\nbeen before.\"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,\npuckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and\nstool, all complete,\" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying\nits beauties.\"'Your humble servant, James Laurence'; only think of his writing that\nto you. I'll tell the girls. They'll think it's splendid,\" said Amy,\nmuch impressed by the note.\"Try it, honey.

This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing-gum after\na long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and\nnewspapers, had suppressed a private post-office, had forbidden\ndistortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that\none man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order.
