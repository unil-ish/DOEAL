But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,\ncannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally; so, though she\nbelieved she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only said, in her\ntenderest tone, \"Does anything trouble you, deary?\"\"Yes, Jo,\" after a long pause.\"Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?\"\"Not now, not yet.\"\"Then I won't ask; but remember, Bethy, that mother and Jo are always\nglad to hear and help you, if they can.\"\"I know it. I'll tell you by and by.\"\"Is the pain better now?\"\"Oh, yes, much better; you are so comfortable, Jo!\"\"Go to sleep, dear; I'll stay with you.\"So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite\nherself again; for at eighteen, neither heads nor hearts ache long, and\na loving word can medicine most ills.But Jo had made up her mind, and, after pondering over a project for\nsome days, she confided it to her mother.\"You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I'll tell you one of\nthem, Marmee,\" she began, as they sat alone together. \"I want to go away\nsomewhere this winter for a change.\"\"Why, Jo?\" and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested a\ndouble meaning.With her eyes on her work, Jo answered soberly, \"I want something new; I\nfeel restless, and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than I\nam. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring up,\nso, as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to hop a little way, and\ntry my wings.\"\"Where will you hop?\"\"To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You know\nMrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her\nchildren and sew. It's rather hard to find just the thing, but I think I\nshould suit if I tried.\"\"My dear, go out to service in that great boarding-house!\" and Mrs.\nMarch looked surprised, but not displeased.\"It's not exactly going out to service; for Mrs. Kirke is your\nfriend,--the kindest soul that ever lived,--and would make things\npleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and no\none knows me there. Don't care if they do; it's honest work, and I'm not\nashamed of it.\"\"Nor I; but your writing?\""

I shall see and hear new things, get new\nideas, and, even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring home\nquantities of material for my rubbish.\"\"I have no doubt of it; but are these your only reasons for this sudden\nfancy?\"\"No, mother.\"\"May I know the others?\"Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in\nher cheeks, \"It may be vain and wrong to say it, but--I'm afraid--Laurie\nis getting too fond of me.\"\"Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care\nfor you?\" and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question.\"Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely\nproud of him; but as for anything more, it's out of the question.\"\"I'm glad of that, Jo.\"\"Why, please?\"\"Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another. As friends you\nare very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over; but I fear\nyou would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much alike\nand too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong wills, to\nget on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite patience and\nforbearance, as well as love.\"\"That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it. I'm glad\nyou think he is only beginning to care for me. It would trouble me sadly\nto make him unhappy; for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old\nfellow merely out of gratitude, could I?\"\"You are sure of his feeling for you?\"The color deepened in Jo's cheeks, as she answered, with the look of\nmingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking\nof first lovers,--\"I'm afraid it is so, mother; he hasn't said anything, but he looks a\ngreat deal. I think I had better go away before it comes to anything.\"\"I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.\"Jo looked relieved, and, after a pause, said, smiling, \"How Mrs. Moffat\nwould wonder at your want of management, if she knew; and how she will\nrejoice that Annie still may hope.\""

For Beth, I\nindulge no hopes except that she may be well. By the way, she seems\nbrighter this last day or two. Have you spoken to her?\"\"Yes; she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by and by. I\nsaid no more, for I think I know it;\" and Jo told her little story.Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the\ncase, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that, for Laurie's\nsake, Jo should go away for a time.\"Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled; then I'll\nrun away before he can collect his wits and be tragical. Beth must think\nI'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't talk about Laurie to\nher; but she can pet and comfort him after I'm gone, and so cure him of\nthis romantic notion. He's been through so many little trials of the\nsort, he's used to it, and will soon get over his love-lornity.\"Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear\nthat this \"little trial\" would be harder than the others, and that\nLaurie would not get over his \"love-lornity\" as easily as heretofore.The plan was talked over in a family council, and agreed upon; for Mrs.\nKirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her.\nThe teaching would render her independent; and such leisure as she got\nmight be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society\nwould be both useful and agreeable. Jo liked the prospect and was eager\nto be gone, for the home-nest was growing too narrow for her restless\nnature and adventurous spirit. When all was settled, with fear and\ntrembling she told Laurie; but to her surprise he took it very quietly.\nHe had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant; and, when\njokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, \"So I\nam; and I mean this one shall stay turned.\"Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on\njust then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart,--for Beth\nseemed more cheerful,--and hoped she was doing the best for all.\"One thing I leave to your especial care,\" she said, the night before\nshe left."

When I lost sight of father's dear old face, I felt a\n    trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an\n    Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less,\n    hadn't diverted my mind; for I amused myself by dropping\n    gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their\n    mouths to roar.\"Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared\n    up likewise, and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.\"Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even\n    in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little\n    sky-parlor--all she had; but there is a stove in it, and a nice\n    table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I\n    like. A fine view and a church-tower opposite atone for the many\n    stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery,\n    where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs.\n    Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty\n    children,--rather spoilt, I fancy, but they took to me after\n    telling them 'The Seven Bad Pigs;' and I've no doubt I shall\n    make a model governess."

My rooms are\n    always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I\n    can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you\n    feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if\n    anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There's the\n    tea-bell; I must run and change my cap;' and off she bustled,\n    leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.\"As I went downstairs, soon after, I saw something I liked. The\n    flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting\n    at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber\n    up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod\n    of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at\n    a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a\n    foreign accent,--\"'It goes better so. The little back is too young to haf such\n    heaviness.'\"Wasn't it good of him? I like such things, for, as father says,\n    trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that\n    evening, she laughed, and said,--\"'That must have been Professor Bhaer; he's always doing things\n    of that sort.'\"Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin; very learned and good, but\n    poor as a church-mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and\n    two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according\n    to the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not a very\n    romantic story, but it interested me; and I was glad to hear\n    that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars.\n    There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to\n    peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he looks.

Some good angel inspired me to try\n    gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and\n    keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk,\n    and I went to my needle-work, like little Mabel, 'with a willing\n    mind.' I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to make nice\n    button-holes, when the parlor-door opened and shut, and some one\n    began to hum,--'Kennst du das land,'like a big bumble-bee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I\n    couldn't resist the temptation; and lifting one end of the\n    curtain before the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was\n    there; and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at\n    him. A regular German,--rather stout, with brown hair tumbled\n    all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I\n    ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good,\n    after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes were\n    rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome\n    feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth; yet I liked\n    him, for he had a fine head; his linen was very nice, and he\n    looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat,\n    and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of\n    his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth\n    bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like\n    an old friend. Then he smiled; and when a tap came at the door,\n    called out in a loud, brisk tone,--\"'Herein!'\"I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a\n    child carrying a big book, and stopped to see what was going on.\"'Me wants my Bhaer,' said the mite, slamming down her book, and\n    running to meet him."

One of the girls kept\n    laughing affectedly, and saying 'Now Professor,' in a\n    coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an\n    accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.\"Both seemed to try his patience sorely; for more than once I\n    heard him say emphatically, 'No, no, it is _not_ so; you haf not\n    attend to what I say;' and once there was a loud rap, as if he\n    struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing\n    exclamation, 'Prut! it all goes bad this day.'\"Poor man, I pitied him; and when the girls were gone, took just\n    one more peep, to see if he survived it. He seemed to have\n    thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with\n    his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put\n    his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and,\n    taking little Tina, who had fallen asleep on the sofa, in his\n    arms, he carried her quietly away.

She gave me a seat by her,\n    and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage, and looked\n    about me. The long table was full, and every one intent on\n    getting their dinner,--the gentlemen especially, who seemed to\n    be eating on time, for they _bolted_ in every sense of the word,\n    vanishing as soon as they were done.

I picked up a few bits of news, and was introduced to the\n    Professor. It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman\n    who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. The little thing\n    has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house\n    like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is\n    very fond of children, though a 'bacheldore.' Kitty and Minnie\n    Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts of\n    stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and\n    the splendid tales he tells. The young men quiz him, it seems,\n    call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner\n    of jokes on his name.

She has fine books and pictures, knows interesting\n    persons, and seems friendly; so I shall make myself agreeable,\n    for I _do_ want to get into good society, only it isn't the same\n    sort that Amy likes.\"I was in our parlor last evening, when Mr. Bhaer came in with\n    some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn't there, but Minnie,\n    who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily: 'This is\n    mamma's friend, Miss March.'\"'Yes; and she's jolly and we like her lots,' added Kitty, who\n    is an _enfant terrible_.\"We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction\n    and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.\"'Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch.\n    If so again, call at me and I come,' he said, with a threatening\n    frown that delighted the little wretches.\"I promised I would, and he departed; but it seems as if I was\n    doomed to see a good deal of him, for to-day, as I passed his\n    door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with my\n    umbrella. It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown,\n    with a big blue sock on one hand, and a darning-needle in the\n    other; he didn't seem at all ashamed of it, for when I explained\n    and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all, saying in his\n    loud, cheerful way,--[Illustration: He waved his hand, sock and all]\"'You haf a fine day to make your walk. _Bon voyage,\n    mademoiselle._'\"I laughed all the way downstairs; but it was a little pathetic,\n    also, to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes.\n    The German gentlemen embroider, I know; but darning hose is\n    another thing, and not so pretty.\"\"_Saturday._"

Just come and help me\n    put these books to rights, for I've turned everything upside\n    down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new\n    handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago.'"

Books and papers everywhere; a broken\n    meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantel-piece as if done\n    with; a ragged bird, without any tail, chirped on one\n    window-seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other;\n    half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the\n    manuscripts; dirty little boots stood drying before the fire;\n    and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave\n    of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand\n    rummage three of the missing articles were found,--one over the\n    bird-cage, one covered with ink, and a third burnt brown, having\n    been used as a holder.\"'Such a man!' laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the\n    relics in the rag-bag. 'I suppose the others are torn up to rig\n    ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite-tails. It's dreadful,\n    but I can't scold him: he's so absent-minded and good-natured,\n    he lets those boys ride over him rough-shod. I agreed to do his\n    washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I\n    forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.'\"'Let me mend them,' said I. 'I don't mind it, and he needn't\n    know. I'd like to,--he's so kind to me about bringing my letters\n    and lending books.'\"So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two\n    pairs of the socks,--for they were boggled out of shape with his\n    queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it\n    out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the\n    lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much\n    that I took a fancy to learn; for Tina runs in and out, leaving\n    the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this\n    door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what\n    he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had\n    gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was\n    busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most\n    absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was\n    Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to\n    Tina not to betray him.\"'So!' he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, 'you peep\n    at me, I peep at you, and that is not bad; but see, I am not\n    pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?'\"'Yes; but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,' I\n    blundered out, as red as a peony."

But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for\npublic opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on\nbigger bean-stalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed\nawhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble, and the\nleast lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly. But the\n\"up again and take another\" spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack; so\nshe scrambled up, on the shady side this time, and got more booty, but\nnearly left behind her what was far more precious than the money-bags.She took to writing sensation stories; for in those dark ages, even\nall-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but concocted a\n\"thrilling tale,\" and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor\nof the \"Weekly Volcano.\" She had never read \"Sartor Resartus,\" but she\nhad a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful\nover many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she\ndressed herself in her best, and, trying to persuade herself that she\nwas neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and\ndirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of\ncigar-smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their\nheels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of\nthem took the trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by\nthis reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much\nembarrassment,--\"Excuse me, I was looking for the 'Weekly Volcano' office; I wished to\nsee Mr. Dashwood.\""

We've more\nof this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present;\nbut I'll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.\"Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at\nall; but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but\nbow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was\napt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both; for it was\nperfectly evident, from the knowing glances exchanged among the\ngentlemen, that her little fiction of \"my friend\" was considered a good\njoke; and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as\nhe closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to\nreturn, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching\npinafores vigorously; and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh\nover the scene, and long for next week.When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced; Mr.\nDashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable; and Mr.\nDashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners:\nso the second interview was much more comfortable than the first."

Her readers were not particular about such trifles\nas grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously\npermitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it\nnecessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the\nfact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely\nleft him in the lurch.She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew\nstout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the mountains\nnext summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One thing\ndisturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at\nhome. She had a feeling that father and mother would not approve, and\npreferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon afterward. It was\neasy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories; Mr.\nDashwood had, of course, found it out very soon, but promised to be\ndumb; and, for a wonder, kept his word.She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write\nnothing of which she should be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of\nconscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her\nearnings and laugh over her well-kept secret."

Jo soon found that her\ninnocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world\nwhich underlies society; so, regarding it in a business light, she set\nabout supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to\nfind material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if\nnot masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents,\nincidents, and crimes; she excited the suspicions of public librarians\nby asking for works on poisons; she studied faces in the street, and\ncharacters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her; she delved in the\ndust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as\ngood as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin, and misery, as well\nas her limited opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering\nfinely; but, unconsciously, she was beginning to desecrate some of the\nwomanliest attributes of a woman's character. She was living in bad\nsociety; and, imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for\nshe was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and\nwas fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature\nacquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to\nall of us.She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of\nother people's passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating\nabout her own,--a morbid amusement, in which healthy young minds do not\nvoluntarily indulge. Wrong-doing always brings its own punishment; and,\nwhen Jo most needed hers, she got it.I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read\ncharacter, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,\nbrave, and strong; but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every\nperfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who interested\nher in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one of their\nconversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and lovely\ncharacters, wherever she found them, as good training for a writer. Jo\ntook him at his word, for she coolly turned round and studied him,--a\nproceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for the\nworthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit."
