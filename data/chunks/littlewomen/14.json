When I lost sight of father's dear old face, I felt a\n    trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an\n    Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less,\n    hadn't diverted my mind; for I amused myself by dropping\n    gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their\n    mouths to roar.\"Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared\n    up likewise, and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.\"Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even\n    in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little\n    sky-parlor--all she had; but there is a stove in it, and a nice\n    table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I\n    like. A fine view and a church-tower opposite atone for the many\n    stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery,\n    where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs.\n    Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty\n    children,--rather spoilt, I fancy, but they took to me after\n    telling them 'The Seven Bad Pigs;' and I've no doubt I shall\n    make a model governess."

My rooms are\n    always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I\n    can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you\n    feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if\n    anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There's the\n    tea-bell; I must run and change my cap;' and off she bustled,\n    leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.\"As I went downstairs, soon after, I saw something I liked. The\n    flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting\n    at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber\n    up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod\n    of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at\n    a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a\n    foreign accent,--\"'It goes better so. The little back is too young to haf such\n    heaviness.'\"Wasn't it good of him? I like such things, for, as father says,\n    trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that\n    evening, she laughed, and said,--\"'That must have been Professor Bhaer; he's always doing things\n    of that sort.'\"Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin; very learned and good, but\n    poor as a church-mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and\n    two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according\n    to the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not a very\n    romantic story, but it interested me; and I was glad to hear\n    that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars.\n    There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to\n    peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he looks. He's almost\n    forty, so it's no harm, Marmee."

I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it\n    once a week; so good-night, and more to-morrow.\"\"_Tuesday Eve._\"Had a lively time in my seminary, this morning, for the\n    children acted like Sancho; and at one time I really thought I\n    should shake them all round. Some good angel inspired me to try\n    gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and\n    keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk,\n    and I went to my needle-work, like little Mabel, 'with a willing\n    mind.' I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to make nice\n    button-holes, when the parlor-door opened and shut, and some one\n    began to hum,--'Kennst du das land,'like a big bumble-bee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I\n    couldn't resist the temptation; and lifting one end of the\n    curtain before the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was\n    there; and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at\n    him. A regular German,--rather stout, with brown hair tumbled\n    all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I\n    ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good,\n    after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes were\n    rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome\n    feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth; yet I liked\n    him, for he had a fine head; his linen was very nice, and he\n    looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat,\n    and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of\n    his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth\n    bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like\n    an old friend. Then he smiled; and when a tap came at the door,\n    called out in a loud, brisk tone,--\"'Herein!'\"I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a\n    child carrying a big book, and stopped to see what was going on.\"'Me wants my Bhaer,' said the mite, slamming down her book, and\n    running to meet him."

One of the girls kept\n    laughing affectedly, and saying 'Now Professor,' in a\n    coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an\n    accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.\"Both seemed to try his patience sorely; for more than once I\n    heard him say emphatically, 'No, no, it is _not_ so; you haf not\n    attend to what I say;' and once there was a loud rap, as if he\n    struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing\n    exclamation, 'Prut! it all goes bad this day.'\"Poor man, I pitied him; and when the girls were gone, took just\n    one more peep, to see if he survived it. He seemed to have\n    thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with\n    his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put\n    his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and,\n    taking little Tina, who had fallen asleep on the sofa, in his\n    arms, he carried her quietly away. I fancy he has a hard life of\n    it."

She gave me a seat by her,\n    and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage, and looked\n    about me. The long table was full, and every one intent on\n    getting their dinner,--the gentlemen especially, who seemed to\n    be eating on time, for they _bolted_ in every sense of the word,\n    vanishing as soon as they were done. There was the usual\n    assortment of young men absorbed in themselves; young couples\n    absorbed in each other; married ladies in their babies, and old\n    gentlemen in politics. I don't think I shall care to have much\n    to do with any of them, except one sweet-faced maiden lady, who\n    looks as if she had something in her.\"Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor,\n    shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf\n    old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with a\n    Frenchman on the other. If Amy had been here, she'd have turned\n    her back on him forever, because, sad to relate, he had a great\n    appetite, and shovelled in his dinner in a manner which would\n    have horrified 'her ladyship.' I didn't mind, for I like 'to see\n    folks eat with a relish,' as Hannah says, and the poor man must\n    have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.\"As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were\n    settling their hats before the hall-mirror, and I heard one say\n    low to the other, 'Who's the new party?'\"'Governess, or something of that sort.'\"'What the deuce is she at our table for?'\"'Friend of the old lady's.'\"'Handsome head, but no style.'\"'Not a bit of it. Give us a light and come on.'\"I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess\n    is as good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't style,\n    which is more than some people have, judging from the remarks of\n    the elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like bad\n    chimneys.

I picked up a few bits of news, and was introduced to the\n    Professor. It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman\n    who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. The little thing\n    has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house\n    like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is\n    very fond of children, though a 'bacheldore.' Kitty and Minnie\n    Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts of\n    stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and\n    the splendid tales he tells. The young men quiz him, it seems,\n    call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner\n    of jokes on his name. But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. K. says,\n    and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him, in spite\n    of his foreign ways.\"The maiden lady is a Miss Norton,--rich, cultivated, and kind.\n    She spoke to me at dinner to-day (for I went to table again,\n    it's such fun to watch people), and asked me to come and see her\n    at her room. She has fine books and pictures, knows interesting\n    persons, and seems friendly; so I shall make myself agreeable,\n    for I _do_ want to get into good society, only it isn't the same\n    sort that Amy likes.\"I was in our parlor last evening, when Mr. Bhaer came in with\n    some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn't there, but Minnie,\n    who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily: 'This is\n    mamma's friend, Miss March.'\"'Yes; and she's jolly and we like her lots,' added Kitty, who\n    is an _enfant terrible_.\"We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction\n    and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.\"'Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch.\n    If so again, call at me and I come,' he said, with a threatening\n    frown that delighted the little wretches.\"I promised I would, and he departed; but it seems as if I was\n    doomed to see a good deal of him, for to-day, as I passed his\n    door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with my\n    umbrella. It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown,\n    with a big blue sock on one hand, and a darning-needle in the\n    other; he didn't seem at all ashamed of it, for when I explained\n    and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all, saying in his\n    loud, cheerful way,--[Illustration: He waved his hand, sock and all]\"'You haf a fine day to make your walk. _Bon voyage,\n    mademoiselle._'\"I laughed all the way downstairs; but it was a little pathetic,\n    also, to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes.\n    The German gentlemen embroider, I know; but darning hose is\n    another thing, and not so pretty.\"\"_Saturday._"

I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from\n    such people don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.\"When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the\n    parlor that I looked in; and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his\n    hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a\n    jump-rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seed-cakes, as\n    they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.\"'We are playing _nargerie_,' explained Kitty.\"'Dis is mine effalunt!' added Tina, holding on by the\n    Professor's hair.[Illustration: Dis is mine effalunt]\"'Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon,\n    when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr. Bhaer?' said\n    Minnie.\"The 'effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of\n    them, and said soberly to me,--\"'I gif you my wort it is so.

After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the\n    way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to\n    shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not\n    so interesting to me as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by\n    them, and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little\n    lads, quite after my own heart; for the mixture of German and\n    American spirit in them produces a constant state of\n    effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether\n    spent in the house or out; for on pleasant days they all go to\n    walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep\n    order; and then such fun!\"We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take lessons. I\n    really couldn't help it, and it all came about in such a droll\n    way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke\n    called to me, one day, as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room, where she\n    was rummaging.\"'Did you ever see such a den, my dear?

Books and papers everywhere; a broken\n    meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantel-piece as if done\n    with; a ragged bird, without any tail, chirped on one\n    window-seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other;\n    half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the\n    manuscripts; dirty little boots stood drying before the fire;\n    and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave\n    of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand\n    rummage three of the missing articles were found,--one over the\n    bird-cage, one covered with ink, and a third burnt brown, having\n    been used as a holder.\"'Such a man!' laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the\n    relics in the rag-bag. 'I suppose the others are torn up to rig\n    ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite-tails. It's dreadful,\n    but I can't scold him: he's so absent-minded and good-natured,\n    he lets those boys ride over him rough-shod. I agreed to do his\n    washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I\n    forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.'\"'Let me mend them,' said I.

I'd like to,--he's so kind to me about bringing my letters\n    and lending books.'\"So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two\n    pairs of the socks,--for they were boggled out of shape with his\n    queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it\n    out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the\n    lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much\n    that I took a fancy to learn; for Tina runs in and out, leaving\n    the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this\n    door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what\n    he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had\n    gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was\n    busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most\n    absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was\n    Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to\n    Tina not to betray him.\"'So!' he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, 'you peep\n    at me, I peep at you, and that is not bad; but see, I am not\n    pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?'\"'Yes; but you are too busy.

Thank Heaven\n    Beth continues so comfortable.\"\"JANUARY.\"A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course\n    includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can't\n    tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn't\n    get it till night, and had given up hoping. Your letter came in\n    the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it\n    for a surprise; so I was disappointed, for I'd had a 'kind of a\n    feeling' that you wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my\n    mind, as I sat up in my room, after tea; and when the big,\n    muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged\n    it, and pranced. It was so _homey_ and refreshing, that I sat\n    down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and\n    cried, in my usual absurd way. The things were just what I\n    wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought.\n    Beth's new 'ink-bib' was capital; and Hannah's box of hard\n    gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll be sure and wear the nice\n    flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books father\n    has marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps!"

It is one he values much, and I've often admired\n    it, set up in the place of honor, with his German Bible, Plato,\n    Homer, and Milton; so you may imagine how I felt when he\n    brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my name in\n    it, 'from my friend Friedrich Bhaer.'\"'You say often you wish a library: here I gif you one; for\n    between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one. Read\n    him well, and he will help you much; for the study of character\n    in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it\n    with your pen.'\"I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about 'my\n    library,' as if I had a hundred books. I never knew how much\n    there was in Shakespeare before; but then I never had a Bhaer to\n    explain it to me. Now _don't_ laugh at his horrid name; it isn't\n    pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people _will_ say it, but\n    something between the two, as only Germans can give it. I'm glad\n    you both like what I tell you about him, and hope you will know\n    him some day. Mother would admire his warm heart, father his\n    wise head. I admire both, and feel rich in my new 'friend\n    Friedrich Bhaer.'"

I heard one of the young men tell\n    another that he knew I'd been an actress; in fact, he thought he\n    remembered seeing me at one of the minor theatres. Meg will\n    relish that joke.

But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for\npublic opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on\nbigger bean-stalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed\nawhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble, and the\nleast lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly. But the\n\"up again and take another\" spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack; so\nshe scrambled up, on the shady side this time, and got more booty, but\nnearly left behind her what was far more precious than the money-bags.She took to writing sensation stories; for in those dark ages, even\nall-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but concocted a\n\"thrilling tale,\" and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor\nof the \"Weekly Volcano.\" She had never read \"Sartor Resartus,\" but she\nhad a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful\nover many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she\ndressed herself in her best, and, trying to persuade herself that she\nwas neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and\ndirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of\ncigar-smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their\nheels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of\nthem took the trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by\nthis reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much\nembarrassment,--\"Excuse me, I was looking for the 'Weekly Volcano' office; I wished to\nsee Mr. Dashwood.\""

Feeling\nthat she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her\nmanuscript, and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,\nblundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the\noccasion.\"A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an\nexperiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this\nsuits.\"While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,\nand was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers, and\ncasting critical glances up and down the neat pages.\"Not a first attempt, I take it?\" observing that the pages were\nnumbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon,--sure\nsign of a novice.\"No, sir; she has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in the\n'Blarneystone Banner.'\"\"Oh, did she?\" and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to\ntake note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the\nbuttons on her boots. \"Well, you can leave it, if you like. We've more\nof this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present;\nbut I'll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.\"Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at\nall; but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but\nbow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was\napt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both; for it was\nperfectly evident, from the knowing glances exchanged among the\ngentlemen, that her little fiction of \"my friend\" was considered a good\njoke; and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as\nhe closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to\nreturn, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching\npinafores vigorously; and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh\nover the scene, and long for next week.When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced; Mr.\nDashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable; and Mr.\nDashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners:\nso the second interview was much more comfortable than the first."

Tell her to make it\nshort and spicy, and never mind the moral.

Her readers were not particular about such trifles\nas grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously\npermitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it\nnecessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the\nfact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely\nleft him in the lurch.She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew\nstout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the mountains\nnext summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One thing\ndisturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at\nhome. She had a feeling that father and mother would not approve, and\npreferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon afterward. It was\neasy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories; Mr.\nDashwood had, of course, found it out very soon, but promised to be\ndumb; and, for a wonder, kept his word.She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write\nnothing of which she should be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of\nconscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her\nearnings and laugh over her well-kept secret."

  "content": "But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales; and, as thrills could\nnot be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers, history\nand romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and lunatic\nasylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose. Jo soon found that her\ninnocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world\nwhich underlies society; so, regarding it in a business light, she set\nabout supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to\nfind material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if\nnot masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents,\nincidents, and crimes; she excited the suspicions of public librarians\nby asking for works on poisons; she studied faces in the street, and\ncharacters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her; she delved in the\ndust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as\ngood as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin, and misery, as well\nas her limited opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering\nfinely; but, unconsciously, she was beginning to desecrate some of the\nwomanliest attributes of a woman's character. She was living in bad\nsociety; and, imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for\nshe was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and\nwas fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature\nacquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to\nall of us.She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of\nother people's passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating\nabout her own,--a morbid amusement, in which healthy young minds do not\nvoluntarily indulge. Wrong-doing always brings its own punishment; and,\nwhen Jo most needed hers, she got it.I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read\ncharacter, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,\nbrave, and strong; but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every\nperfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who interested\nher in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one of their\nconversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and lovely\ncharacters, wherever she found them, as good training for a writer. Jo\ntook him at his word, for she coolly turned round and studied him,--a\nproceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for the\nworthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit."

  "content": "Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first. He was neither\nrich nor great, young nor handsome; in no respect what is called\nfascinating, imposing, or brilliant; and yet he was as attractive as a\ngenial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about\na warm hearth. He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving something\naway; a stranger, yet every one was his friend; no longer young, but as\nhappy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face looked\nbeautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake.\nJo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and, at last,\ndecided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. If he had any\nsorrow, \"it sat with its head under its wing,\" and he turned only his\nsunny side to the world. There were lines upon his forehead, but Time\nseemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to\nothers. The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many\nfriendly words and cheery laughs; his eyes were never cold or hard, and\nhis big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than\nwords.His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the\nwearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him\ncomfortable; his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart\nunderneath; his rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets\nplainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full;\nhis very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy\nlike other people's.\"That's it!\" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that\ngenuine good-will towards one's fellow-men could beautify and dignify\neven a stout German teacher, who shovelled in his dinner, darned his own\nsocks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine\nrespect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the\nProfessor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,\nand no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much\nhonored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came\nto see him, and, in a conversation with Miss Norton, divulged the\npleasing fact. From her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better\nbecause Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She felt proud to know that he was\nan honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in\nAmerica; and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the\nspice of romance which this discovery gave it.Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most\nunexpected manner. Miss Norton had the _entrée_ into literary society,\nwhich Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her. The solitary\nwoman felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many\nfavors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor. She took them with\nher, one night, to a select symposium, held in honor of several\ncelebrities.[Illustration: A select symposium]"

But her reverence for\ngenius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to\nrecover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and\nwomen after all. Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid\nadmiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on\n\"spirit, fire, and dew,\" to behold him devouring his supper with an\nardor which flushed his intellectual countenance. Turning as from a\nfallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her\nromantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\nwith the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with\none of the Madame de Staëls of the age, who looked daggers at another\nCorinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after out-manœuvring her in\nefforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly\nand appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech\nimpossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and\nglacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting themselves to\noysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician, who was\ncharming the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen\nof the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of\nthe party.Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely _désillusionée_,\nthat she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined\nher, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the\nphilosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an\nintellectual tournament in the recess. The conversation was miles beyond\nJo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were\nunknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms; and the\nonly thing \"evolved from her inner consciousness,\" was a bad headache\nafter it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually that the world was\nbeing picked to pieces, and put together on new, and, according to the\ntalkers, on infinitely better principles than before; that religion was\nin a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be\nthe only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any\nsort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came\nover her, as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time\nand space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him\nlooking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.\nHe shook his head, and beckoned her to come away; but she was\nfascinated, just then, by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and\nkept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to\nrely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man, and slow to offer his own opinions,\nnot because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be\nlightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,\nattracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his\nbrows, and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul\nwould be led astray by the rockets, to find, when the display was over,\nthat they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand."
