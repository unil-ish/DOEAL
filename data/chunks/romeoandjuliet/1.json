Young men’s love then lies\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\nHath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste.\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\nThy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\nOf an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\nAnd art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,\nWomen may fall, when there’s no strength in men.ROMEO.\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.ROMEO.\nAnd bad’st me bury love.FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nNot in a grave\nTo lay one in, another out to have.ROMEO.\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\nThe other did not so.FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, she knew well\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\nBut come young waverer, come go with me,\nIn one respect I’ll thy assistant be;\nFor this alliance may so happy prove,\nTo turn your households’ rancour to pure love.ROMEO.\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.[_Exeunt._]SCENE IV. A Street.Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.MERCUTIO.\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?BENVOLIO.\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man.MERCUTIO.\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so\nthat he will sure run mad.BENVOLIO.\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s\nhouse.MERCUTIO.\nA challenge, on my life.BENVOLIO.\nRomeo will answer it.MERCUTIO.\nAny man that can write may answer a letter.BENVOLIO.\nNay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.MERCUTIO.\nAlas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black\neye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart\ncleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter\nTybalt?BENVOLIO.\nWhy, what is Tybalt?MERCUTIO.\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\ncompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\nand proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\nyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\na gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause.

Romeo he cries aloud,\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die."
