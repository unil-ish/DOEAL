Get thee gone,\nAnd hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.[_Exit Balthasar._]Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.\nLet’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift\nTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men.\nI do remember an apothecary,—\nAnd hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted\nIn tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,\nCulling of simples, meagre were his looks,\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\nAn alligator stuff’d, and other skins\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\nWere thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,\nAnd if a man did need a poison now,\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\nBeing holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.\nWhat, ho! Apothecary!Enter Apothecary."
