All through\ntheir girlhood she had felt that she could act on her sister by a word\njudiciously placed—by opening a little window for the daylight of her\nown understanding to enter among the strange colored lamps by which\nDodo habitually saw. And Celia the matron naturally felt more able to\nadvise her childless sister. How could any one understand Dodo so well\nas Celia did or love her so tenderly?Dorothea, busy in her boudoir, felt a glow of pleasure at the sight of\nher sister so soon after the revelation of her intended marriage. She\nhad prefigured to herself, even with exaggeration, the disgust of her\nfriends, and she had even feared that Celia might be kept aloof from\nher.“O Kitty, I am delighted to see you!” said Dorothea, putting her hands\non Celia’s shoulders, and beaming on her. “I almost thought you would\nnot come to me.”"

And I can’t think that it ever _will_ be—you\nnever can go and live in that way. And then there are all your plans!\nYou never can have thought of that. James would have taken any trouble\nfor you, and you might have gone on all your life doing what you\nliked.”“On the contrary, dear,” said Dorothea, “I never could do anything that\nI liked. I have never carried out any plan yet.”“Because you always wanted things that wouldn’t do. But other plans\nwould have come. And how _can_ you marry Mr. Ladislaw, that we none of\nus ever thought you _could_ marry? It shocks James so dreadfully. And\nthen it is all so different from what you have always been. You would\nhave Mr. Casaubon because he had such a great soul, and was so old and\ndismal and learned; and now, to think of marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has\ngot no estate or anything. I suppose it is because you must be making\nyourself uncomfortable in some way or other.”Dorothea laughed.“Well, it is very serious, Dodo,” said Celia, becoming more impressive.\n“How will you live? and you will go away among queer people. And I\nshall never see you—and you won’t mind about little Arthur—and I\nthought you always would—”Celia’s rare tears had got into her eyes, and the corners of her mouth\nwere agitated.“Dear Celia,” said Dorothea, with tender gravity, “if you don’t ever\nsee me, it will not be my fault.”“Yes, it will,” said Celia, with the same touching distortion of her\nsmall features. “How can I come to you or have you with me when James\ncan’t bear it?—that is because he thinks it is not right—he thinks you\nare so wrong, Dodo. But you always were wrong: only I can’t help loving\nyou. And nobody can think where you will live: where can you go?”“I am going to London,” said Dorothea."

I could\ngive you half my things, only how can I, when I never see you?”“Bless you, Kitty,” said Dorothea, with gentle warmth. “Take comfort:\nperhaps James will forgive me some time.”“But it would be much better if you would not be married,” said Celia,\ndrying her eyes, and returning to her argument; “then there would be\nnothing uncomfortable. And you would not do what nobody thought you\ncould do. James always said you ought to be a queen; but this is not at\nall being like a queen. You know what mistakes you have always been\nmaking, Dodo, and this is another. Nobody thinks Mr. Ladislaw a proper\nhusband for you. And you _said_ you would never be married again.”“It is quite true that I might be a wiser person, Celia,” said\nDorothea, “and that I might have done something better, if I had been\nbetter. But this is what I am going to do. I have promised to marry Mr.\nLadislaw; and I am going to marry him.”The tone in which Dorothea said this was a note that Celia had long\nlearned to recognize. She was silent a few moments, and then said, as\nif she had dismissed all contest, “Is he very fond of you, Dodo?”“I hope so. I am very fond of him.”“That is nice,” said Celia, comfortably. “Only I would rather you had\nsuch a sort of husband as James is, with a place very near, that I\ncould drive to.”Dorothea smiled, and Celia looked rather meditative. Presently she\nsaid, “I cannot think how it all came about.” Celia thought it would be\npleasant to hear the story.“I dare say not,” said Dorothea, pinching her sister’s chin. “If you\nknew how it came about, it would not seem wonderful to you.”“Can’t you tell me?” said Celia, settling her arms cozily.“No, dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know.”CHAPTER LXXXV."

And first among themselves, Mr. Blindman, the foreman, said, I\nsee clearly that this man is a heretic. Then said Mr. No-good, Away\nwith such a fellow from the earth! Ay, said Mr. Malice, for I hate the\nvery look of him. Then said Mr. Love-lust, I could never endure him.\nNor I, said Mr. Live-loose; for he would be always condemning my way.\nHang him, hang him, said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr. High-mind.\nMy heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity. He is a rogue, said Mr.\nLiar. Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty. Let us despatch\nhim out of the way said Mr. Hate-light. Then said Mr. Implacable, Might\nI have all the world given me, I could not be reconciled to him;\ntherefore let us forthwith bring him in guilty of death.”—_Pilgrim’s\nProgress_.When immortal Bunyan makes his picture of the persecuting passions\nbringing in their verdict of guilty, who pities Faithful? That is a\nrare and blessed lot which some greatest men have not attained, to know\nourselves guiltless before a condemning crowd—to be sure that what we\nare denounced for is solely the good in us. The pitiable lot is that of\nthe man who could not call himself a martyr even though he were to\npersuade himself that the men who stoned him were but ugly passions\nincarnate—who knows that he is stoned, not for professing the Right,\nbut for not being the man he professed to be.This was the consciousness that Bulstrode was withering under while he\nmade his preparations for departing from Middlemarch, and going to end\nhis stricken life in that sad refuge, the indifference of new faces.\nThe duteous merciful constancy of his wife had delivered him from one\ndread, but it could not hinder her presence from being still a tribunal\nbefore which he shrank from confession and desired advocacy. His\nequivocations with himself about the death of Raffles had sustained the\nconception of an Omniscience whom he prayed to, yet he had a terror\nupon him which would not let him expose them to judgment by a full\nconfession to his wife: the acts which he had washed and diluted with\ninward argument and motive, and for which it seemed comparatively easy\nto win invisible pardon—what name would she call them by? That she\nshould ever silently call his acts Murder was what he could not bear.\nHe felt shrouded by her doubt: he got strength to face her from the\nsense that she could not yet feel warranted in pronouncing that worst\ncondemnation on him. Some time, perhaps—when he was dying—he would tell\nher all: in the deep shadow of that time, when she held his hand in the\ngathering darkness, she might listen without recoiling from his touch.\nPerhaps: but concealment had been the habit of his life, and the\nimpulse to confession had no power against the dread of a deeper\nhumiliation."

She had sent her daughters away to board\nat a school on the coast, that this crisis might be hidden from them as\nfar as possible. Set free by their absence from the intolerable\nnecessity of accounting for her grief or of beholding their frightened\nwonder, she could live unconstrainedly with the sorrow that was every\nday streaking her hair with whiteness and making her eyelids languid.“Tell me anything that you would like to have me do, Harriet,”\nBulstrode had said to her; “I mean with regard to arrangements of\nproperty. It is my intention not to sell the land I possess in this\nneighborhood, but to leave it to you as a safe provision. If you have\nany wish on such subjects, do not conceal it from me.”A few days afterwards, when she had returned from a visit to her\nbrother’s, she began to speak to her husband on a subject which had for\nsome time been in her mind.“I _should_ like to do something for my brother’s family, Nicholas; and\nI think we are bound to make some amends to Rosamond and her husband.\nWalter says Mr. Lydgate must leave the town, and his practice is almost\ngood for nothing, and they have very little left to settle anywhere\nwith. I would rather do without something for ourselves, to make some\namends to my poor brother’s family.”Mrs. Bulstrode did not wish to go nearer to the facts than in the\nphrase “make some amends;” knowing that her husband must understand\nher. He had a particular reason, which she was not aware of, for\nwincing under her suggestion. He hesitated before he said—“It is not possible to carry out your wish in the way you propose, my\ndear. Mr. Lydgate has virtually rejected any further service from me.\nHe has returned the thousand pounds which I lent him. Mrs. Casaubon\nadvanced him the sum for that purpose. Here is his letter.”The letter seemed to cut Mrs. Bulstrode severely. The mention of Mrs.\nCasaubon’s loan seemed a reflection of that public feeling which held\nit a matter of course that every one would avoid a connection with her\nhusband. She was silent for some time; and the tears fell one after the\nother, her chin trembling as she wiped them away. Bulstrode, sitting\nopposite to her, ached at the sight of that grief-worn face, which two\nmonths before had been bright and blooming. It had aged to keep sad\ncompany with his own withered features. Urged into some effort at\ncomforting her, he said—"

The stock was to remain as it\nis, and they were to pay a certain share of the profits instead of an\nordinary rent. That would be a desirable beginning for the young man,\nin conjunction with his employment under Garth.

She had a pink kerchief tied over\nher head, making a little poke to shade her eyes from the level\nsunbeams, while she was giving a glorious swing to Letty, who laughed\nand screamed wildly.Seeing her father, Mary left the swing and went to meet him, pushing\nback the pink kerchief and smiling afar off at him with the involuntary\nsmile of loving pleasure.“I came to look for you, Mary,” said Mr. Garth. “Let us walk about a\nbit.”Mary knew quite well that her father had something particular to say:\nhis eyebrows made their pathetic angle, and there was a tender gravity\nin his voice: these things had been signs to her when she was Letty’s\nage. She put her arm within his, and they turned by the row of\nnut-trees.“It will be a sad while before you can be married, Mary,” said her\nfather, not looking at her, but at the end of the stick which he held\nin his other hand.“Not a sad while, father—I mean to be merry,” said Mary, laughingly. “I\nhave been single and merry for four-and-twenty years and more: I\nsuppose it will not be quite as long again as that.” Then, after a\nlittle pause, she said, more gravely, bending her face before her\nfather’s, “If you are contented with Fred?”Caleb screwed up his mouth and turned his head aside wisely.“Now, father, you did praise him last Wednesday. You said he had an\nuncommon notion of stock, and a good eye for things.”“Did I?” said Caleb, rather slyly.“Yes, I put it all down, and the date, _anno Domini_, and everything,”\nsaid Mary. “You like things to be neatly booked. And then his behavior\nto you, father, is really good; he has a deep respect for you; and it\nis impossible to have a better temper than Fred has.”“Ay, ay; you want to coax me into thinking him a fine match.”“No, indeed, father. I don’t love him because he is a fine match.”“What for, then?”"

A woman must not force\nher heart—she’ll do a man no good by that.”“My feelings have not changed, father,” said Mary, calmly. “I shall be\nconstant to Fred as long as he is constant to me. I don’t think either\nof us could spare the other, or like any one else better, however much\nwe might admire them. It would make too great a difference to us—like\nseeing all the old places altered, and changing the name for\neverything. We must wait for each other a long while; but Fred knows\nthat.”Instead of speaking immediately, Caleb stood still and screwed his\nstick on the grassy walk. Then he said, with emotion in his voice,\n“Well, I’ve got a bit of news. What do you think of Fred going to live\nat Stone Court, and managing the land there?”“How can that ever be, father?” said Mary, wonderingly.“He would manage it for his aunt Bulstrode. The poor woman has been to\nme begging and praying. She wants to do the lad good, and it might be a\nfine thing for him. With saving, he might gradually buy the stock, and\nhe has a turn for farming.”“Oh, Fred would be so happy! It is too good to believe.”“Ah, but mind you,” said Caleb, turning his head warningly, “I must\ntake it on _my_ shoulders, and be responsible, and see after\neverything; and that will grieve your mother a bit, though she mayn’t\nsay so. Fred had need be careful.”“Perhaps it is too much, father,” said Mary, checked in her joy. “There\nwould be no happiness in bringing you any fresh trouble.”"

He’ll be coming by-and-by, so I wanted to tell you first,\nbecause I think you’d like to tell _him_ by yourselves. After that, I\ncould talk it well over with him, and we could go into business and the\nnature of things.”“Oh, you dear good father!” cried Mary, putting her hands round her\nfather’s neck, while he bent his head placidly, willing to be caressed.\n“I wonder if any other girl thinks her father the best man in the\nworld!”“Nonsense, child; you’ll think your husband better.”“Impossible,” said Mary, relapsing into her usual tone; “husbands are\nan inferior class of men, who require keeping in order.”When they were entering the house with Letty, who had run to join them,\nMary saw Fred at the orchard-gate, and went to meet him.“What fine clothes you wear, you extravagant youth!” said Mary, as Fred\nstood still and raised his hat to her with playful formality. “You are\nnot learning economy.”“Now that is too bad, Mary,” said Fred. “Just look at the edges of\nthese coat-cuffs! It is only by dint of good brushing that I look\nrespectable. I am saving up three suits—one for a wedding-suit.”“How very droll you will look!—like a gentleman in an old\nfashion-book.”“Oh no, they will keep two years.”“Two years! be reasonable, Fred,” said Mary, turning to walk. “Don’t\nencourage flattering expectations.”“Why not? One lives on them better than on unflattering ones. If we\ncan’t be married in two years, the truth will be quite bad enough when\nit comes.”“I have heard a story of a young gentleman who once encouraged\nflattering expectations, and they did him harm.”“Mary, if you’ve got something discouraging to tell me, I shall bolt; I\nshall go into the house to Mr. Garth. I am out of spirits. My father is\nso cut up—home is not like itself. I can’t bear any more bad news.”“Should you call it bad news to be told that you were to live at Stone\nCourt, and manage the farm, and be remarkably prudent, and save money\nevery year till all the stock and furniture were your own, and you were\na distinguished agricultural character, as Mr. Borthrop Trumbull\nsays—rather stout, I fear, and with the Greek and Latin sadly\nweather-worn?”"

In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved:\nmost persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred’s\nauthorship was due to his wife, since they had never expected Fred\nVincy to write on turnips and mangel-wurzel.But when Mary wrote a little book for her boys, called “Stories of\nGreat Men, taken from Plutarch,” and had it printed and published by\nGripp & Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town was willing to give the\ncredit of this work to Fred, observing that he had been to the\nUniversity, “where the ancients were studied,” and might have been a\nclergyman if he had chosen.In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived,\nand that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since\nit was always done by somebody else."

Some years after his\nmarriage he told Mary that his happiness was half owing to Farebrother,\nwho gave him a strong pull-up at the right moment. I cannot say that he\nwas never again misled by his hopefulness: the yield of crops or the\nprofits of a cattle sale usually fell below his estimate; and he was\nalways prone to believe that he could make money by the purchase of a\nhorse which turned out badly—though this, Mary observed, was of course\nthe fault of the horse, not of Fred’s judgment. He kept his love of\nhorsemanship, but he rarely allowed himself a day’s hunting; and when\nhe did so, it was remarkable that he submitted to be laughed at for\ncowardliness at the fences, seeming to see Mary and the boys sitting on\nthe five-barred gate, or showing their curly heads between hedge and\nditch.There were three boys: Mary was not discontented that she brought forth\nmen-children only; and when Fred wished to have a girl like her, she\nsaid, laughingly, “that would be too great a trial to your mother.”\nMrs. Vincy in her declining years, and in the diminished lustre of her\nhousekeeping, was much comforted by her perception that two at least of\nFred’s boys were real Vincys, and did not “feature the Garths.” But\nMary secretly rejoiced that the youngest of the three was very much\nwhat her father must have been when he wore a round jacket, and showed\na marvellous nicety of aim in playing at marbles, or in throwing stones\nto bring down the mellow pears.Ben and Letty Garth, who were uncle and aunt before they were well in\ntheir teens, disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces were more\ndesirable; Ben contending that it was clear girls were good for less\nthan boys, else they would not be always in petticoats, which showed\nhow little they were meant for; whereupon Letty, who argued much from\nbooks, got angry in replying that God made coats of skins for both Adam\nand Eve alike—also it occurred to her that in the East the men too wore\npetticoats. But this latter argument, obscuring the majesty of the\nformer, was one too many, for Ben answered contemptuously, “The more\nspooneys they!” and immediately appealed to his mother whether boys\nwere not better than girls. Mrs. Garth pronounced that both were alike\nnaughty, but that boys were undoubtedly stronger, could run faster, and\nthrow with more precision to a greater distance.

Mary, in her matronly days, became as solid in\nfigure as her mother; but, unlike her, gave the boys little formal\nteaching, so that Mrs. Garth was alarmed lest they should never be well\ngrounded in grammar and geography. Nevertheless, they were found quite\nforward enough when they went to school; perhaps, because they had\nliked nothing so well as being with their mother. When Fred was riding\nhome on winter evenings he had a pleasant vision beforehand of the\nbright hearth in the wainscoted parlor, and was sorry for other men who\ncould not have Mary for their wife; especially for Mr. Farebrother. “He\nwas ten times worthier of you than I was,” Fred could now say to her,\nmagnanimously. “To be sure he was,” Mary answered; “and for that reason\nhe could do better without me. But you—I shudder to think what you\nwould have been—a curate in debt for horse-hire and cambric\npocket-handkerchiefs!”On inquiry it might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still inhabit\nStone Court—that the creeping plants still cast the foam of their\nblossoms over the fine stone-wall into the field where the walnut-trees\nstand in stately row—and that on sunny days the two lovers who were\nfirst engaged with the umbrella-ring may be seen in white-haired\nplacidity at the open window from which Mary Garth, in the days of old\nPeter Featherstone, had often been ordered to look out for Mr. Lydgate."

His skill was relied on by many paying patients, but he\nalways regarded himself as a failure: he had not done what he once\nmeant to do. His acquaintances thought him enviable to have so charming\na wife, and nothing happened to shake their opinion. Rosamond never\ncommitted a second compromising indiscretion. She simply continued to\nbe mild in her temper, inflexible in her judgment, disposed to admonish\nher husband, and able to frustrate him by stratagem. As the years went\non he opposed her less and less, whence Rosamond concluded that he had\nlearned the value of her opinion; on the other hand, she had a more\nthorough conviction of his talents now that he gained a good income,\nand instead of the threatened cage in Bride Street provided one all\nflowers and gilding, fit for the bird of paradise that she resembled.\nIn brief, Lydgate was what is called a successful man. But he died\nprematurely of diphtheria, and Rosamond afterwards married an elderly\nand wealthy physician, who took kindly to her four children. She made a\nvery pretty show with her daughters, driving out in her carriage, and\noften spoke of her happiness as “a reward”—she did not say for what,\nbut probably she meant that it was a reward for her patience with\nTertius, whose temper never became faultless, and to the last\noccasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more memorable than the\nsigns he made of his repentance. He once called her his basil plant;\nand when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant\nwhich had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man’s brains. Rosamond\nhad a placid but strong answer to such speeches. Why then had he chosen\nher? It was a pity he had not had Mrs. Ladislaw, whom he was always\npraising and placing above her. And thus the conversation ended with\nthe advantage on Rosamond’s side. But it would be unjust not to tell,\nthat she never uttered a word in depreciation of Dorothea, keeping in\nreligious remembrance the generosity which had come to her aid in the\nsharpest crisis of her life."

  "content": "Dorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other women,\nfeeling that there was always something better which she might have\ndone, if she had only been better and known better. Still, she never\nrepented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will\nLadislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as\nsorrow to him if she had repented. They were bound to each other by a\nlove stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life\nwould have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion,\nand she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she\nhad not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for herself.\nWill became an ardent public man, working well in those times when\nreforms were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has\nbeen much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to\nParliament by a constituency who paid his expenses. Dorothea could have\nliked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband\nshould be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that she should\ngive him wifely help. Many who knew her, thought it a pity that so\nsubstantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life\nof another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother.\nBut no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought\nrather to have done—not even Sir James Chettam, who went no further\nthan the negative prescription that she ought not to have married Will\nLadislaw."

  "content": "But this opinion of his did not cause a lasting alienation; and the way\nin which the family was made whole again was characteristic of all\nconcerned. Mr. Brooke could not resist the pleasure of corresponding\nwith Will and Dorothea; and one morning when his pen had been\nremarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform, it ran off into\nan invitation to the Grange, which, once written, could not be done\naway with at less cost than the sacrifice (hardly to be conceived) of\nthe whole valuable letter. During the months of this correspondence Mr.\nBrooke had continually, in his talk with Sir James Chettam, been\npresupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail\nwas still maintained; and the day on which his pen gave the daring\ninvitation, he went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he had a\nstronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step\nas a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the\nBrookes.But that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall. A letter\nhad come to Celia which made her cry silently as she read it; and when\nSir James, unused to see her in tears, asked anxiously what was the\nmatter, she burst out in a wail such as he had never heard from her\nbefore.“Dorothea has a little boy. And you will not let me go and see her. And\nI am sure she wants to see me. And she will not know what to do with\nthe baby—she will do wrong things with it. And they thought she would\ndie. It is very dreadful! Suppose it had been me and little Arthur, and\nDodo had been hindered from coming to see me! I wish you would be less\nunkind, James!”“Good heavens, Celia!” said Sir James, much wrought upon, “what do you\nwish? I will do anything you like. I will take you to town to-morrow if\nyou wish it.” And Celia did wish it.It was after this that Mr. Brooke came, and meeting the Baronet in the\ngrounds, began to chat with him in ignorance of the news, which Sir\nJames for some reason did not care to tell him immediately. But when\nthe entail was touched on in the usual way, he said, “My dear sir, it\nis not for me to dictate to you, but for my part I would let that\nalone. I would let things remain as they are.”Mr. Brooke felt so much surprised that he did not at once find out how\nmuch he was relieved by the sense that he was not expected to do\nanything in particular.Such being the bent of Celia’s heart, it was inevitable that Sir James\nshould consent to a reconciliation with Dorothea and her husband. Where\nwomen love each other, men learn to smother their mutual dislike. Sir\nJames never liked Ladislaw, and Will always preferred to have Sir\nJames’s company mixed with another kind: they were on a footing of\nreciprocal tolerance which was made quite easy only when Dorothea and\nCelia were present."

  "content": "It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should pay at\nleast two visits during the year to the Grange, and there came\ngradually a small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed playing with\nthe two cousins visiting Tipton as much as if the blood of these\ncousins had been less dubiously mixed.Mr. Brooke lived to a good old age, and his estate was inherited by\nDorothea’s son, who might have represented Middlemarch, but declined,\nthinking that his opinions had less chance of being stifled if he\nremained out of doors.Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea’s second marriage as a\nmistake; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in\nMiddlemarch, where she was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine\ngirl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be her father, and\nin little more than a year after his death gave up her estate to marry\nhis cousin—young enough to have been his son, with no property, and not\nwell-born. Those who had not seen anything of Dorothea usually observed\nthat she could not have been “a nice woman,” else she would not have\nmarried either the one or the other.Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally\nbeautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse\nstruggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which\ngreat feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the\naspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so\nstrong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it. A new\nTheresa will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventual\nlife, any more than a new Antigone will spend her heroic piety in\ndaring all for the sake of a brother’s burial: the medium in which\ntheir ardent deeds took shape is forever gone. But we insignificant\npeople with our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many\nDorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that\nof the Dorothea whose story we know."
