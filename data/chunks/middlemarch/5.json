  "content": "“Precisely. And on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as no\nteaching. Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a new\nregulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary. The building\nstands in Mr. Farebrother’s parish. You know Mr. Farebrother?”“I have seen him. He gave me his vote. I must call to thank him. He\nseems a very bright pleasant little fellow. And I understand he is a\nnaturalist.”“Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, is a man deeply painful to contemplate.\nI suppose there is not a clergyman in this country who has greater\ntalents.” Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative.“I have not yet been pained by finding any excessive talent in\nMiddlemarch,” said Lydgate, bluntly.“What I desire,” Mr. Bulstrode continued, looking still more serious,\n“is that Mr. Farebrother’s attendance at the hospital should be\nsuperseded by the appointment of a chaplain—of Mr. Tyke, in fact—and\nthat no other spiritual aid should be called in.”“As a medical man I could have no opinion on such a point unless I knew\nMr. Tyke, and even then I should require to know the cases in which he\nwas applied.” Lydgate smiled, but he was bent on being circumspect.“Of course you cannot enter fully into the merits of this measure at\npresent. But”—here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a more chiselled\nemphasis—“the subject is likely to be referred to the medical board of\nthe infirmary, and what I trust I may ask of you is, that in virtue of\nthe cooperation between us which I now look forward to, you will not,\nso far as you are concerned, be influenced by my opponents in this\nmatter.”“I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes,” said\nLydgate. “The path I have chosen is to work well in my own profession.”"

  "content": "“My responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, is of a broader kind. With me, indeed,\nthis question is one of sacred accountableness; whereas with my\nopponents, I have good reason to say that it is an occasion for\ngratifying a spirit of worldly opposition. But I shall not therefore\ndrop one iota of my convictions, or cease to identify myself with that\ntruth which an evil generation hates. I have devoted myself to this\nobject of hospital-improvement, but I will boldly confess to you, Mr.\nLydgate, that I should have no interest in hospitals if I believed that\nnothing more was concerned therein than the cure of mortal diseases. I\nhave another ground of action, and in the face of persecution I will\nnot conceal it.”Mr. Bulstrode’s voice had become a loud and agitated whisper as he said\nthe last words.“There we certainly differ,” said Lydgate. But he was not sorry that\nthe door was now opened, and Mr. Vincy was announced. That florid\nsociable personage was become more interesting to him since he had seen\nRosamond. Not that, like her, he had been weaving any future in which\ntheir lots were united; but a man naturally remembers a charming girl\nwith pleasure, and is willing to dine where he may see her again.\nBefore he took leave, Mr. Vincy had given that invitation which he had\nbeen “in no hurry about,” for Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that\nshe thought her uncle Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great\nfavor.Mr. Bulstrode, alone with his brother-in-law, poured himself out a\nglass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.“I cannot persuade you to adopt my regimen, Vincy?”“No, no; I’ve no opinion of that system. Life wants padding,” said Mr.\nVincy, unable to omit his portable theory. “However,” he went on,\naccenting the word, as if to dismiss all irrelevance, “what I came here\nto talk about was a little affair of my young scapegrace, Fred’s.”“That is a subject on which you and I are likely to take quite as\ndifferent views as on diet, Vincy.”“I hope not this time.” (Mr. Vincy was resolved to be good-humored.)\n“The fact is, it’s about a whim of old Featherstone’s. Somebody has\nbeen cooking up a story out of spite, and telling it to the old man, to\ntry to set him against Fred. He’s very fond of Fred, and is likely to\ndo something handsome for him; indeed he has as good as told Fred that\nhe means to leave him his land, and that makes other people jealous.”"

  "content": "“Vincy, I must repeat, that you will not get any concurrence from me as\nto the course you have pursued with your eldest son. It was entirely\nfrom worldly vanity that you destined him for the Church: with a family\nof three sons and four daughters, you were not warranted in devoting\nmoney to an expensive education which has succeeded in nothing but in\ngiving him extravagant idle habits. You are now reaping the\nconsequences.”To point out other people’s errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode rarely\nshrank from, but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be patient. When\na man has the immediate prospect of being mayor, and is ready, in the\ninterests of commerce, to take up a firm attitude on politics\ngenerally, he has naturally a sense of his importance to the framework\nof things which seems to throw questions of private conduct into the\nbackground. And this particular reproof irritated him more than any\nother. It was eminently superfluous to him to be told that he was\nreaping the consequences. But he felt his neck under Bulstrode’s yoke;\nand though he usually enjoyed kicking, he was anxious to refrain from\nthat relief.“As to that, Bulstrode, it’s no use going back. I’m not one of your\npattern men, and I don’t pretend to be. I couldn’t foresee everything\nin the trade; there wasn’t a finer business in Middlemarch than ours,\nand the lad was clever. My poor brother was in the Church, and would\nhave done well—had got preferment already, but that stomach fever took\nhim off: else he might have been a dean by this time. I think I was\njustified in what I tried to do for Fred. If you come to religion, it\nseems to me a man shouldn’t want to carve out his meat to an ounce\nbeforehand:—one must trust a little to Providence and be generous. It’s\na good British feeling to try and raise your family a little: in my\nopinion, it’s a father’s duty to give his sons a fine chance.”“I don’t wish to act otherwise than as your best friend, Vincy, when I\nsay that what you have been uttering just now is one mass of\nworldliness and inconsistent folly.”“Very well,” said Mr. Vincy, kicking in spite of resolutions, “I never\nprofessed to be anything but worldly; and, what’s more, I don’t see\nanybody else who is not worldly. I suppose you don’t conduct business\non what you call unworldly principles. The only difference I see is\nthat one worldliness is a little bit honester than another.”"

The long and short of it is, somebody has told old\nFeatherstone, giving you as the authority, that Fred has been borrowing\nor trying to borrow money on the prospect of his land. Of course you\nnever said any such nonsense. But the old fellow will insist on it that\nFred should bring him a denial in your handwriting; that is, just a bit\nof a note saying you don’t believe a word of such stuff, either of his\nhaving borrowed or tried to borrow in such a fool’s way. I suppose you\ncan have no objection to do that.”“Pardon me. I have an objection. I am by no means sure that your son,\nin his recklessness and ignorance—I will use no severer word—has not\ntried to raise money by holding out his future prospects, or even that\nsome one may not have been foolish enough to supply him on so vague a\npresumption: there is plenty of such lax money-lending as of other\nfolly in the world.”“But Fred gives me his honor that he has never borrowed money on the\npretence of any understanding about his uncle’s land. He is not a liar.\nI don’t want to make him better than he is. I have blown him up\nwell—nobody can say I wink at what he does. But he is not a liar. And I\nshould have thought—but I may be wrong—that there was no religion to\nhinder a man from believing the best of a young fellow, when you don’t\nknow worse. It seems to me it would be a poor sort of religion to put a\nspoke in his wheel by refusing to say you don’t believe such harm of\nhim as you’ve got no good reason to believe.”"

You do not like to hear these things, Vincy,\nbut on this occasion I feel called upon to tell you that I have no\nmotive for furthering such a disposition of property as that which you\nrefer to. I do not shrink from saying that it will not tend to your\nson’s eternal welfare or to the glory of God. Why then should you\nexpect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to\nkeep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?”“If you mean to hinder everybody from having money but saints and\nevangelists, you must give up some profitable partnerships, that’s all\nI can say,” Mr. Vincy burst out very bluntly. “It may be for the glory\nof God, but it is not for the glory of the Middlemarch trade, that\nPlymdale’s house uses those blue and green dyes it gets from the\nBrassing manufactory; they rot the silk, that’s all I know about it.\nPerhaps if other people knew so much of the profit went to the glory of\nGod, they might like it better. But I don’t mind so much about that—I\ncould get up a pretty row, if I chose.”Mr. Bulstrode paused a little before he answered. “You pain me very\nmuch by speaking in this way, Vincy. I do not expect you to understand\nmy grounds of action—it is not an easy thing even to thread a path for\nprinciples in the intricacies of the world—still less to make the\nthread clear for the careless and the scoffing. You must remember, if\nyou please, that I stretch my tolerance towards you as my wife’s\nbrother, and that it little becomes you to complain of me as\nwithholding material help towards the worldly position of your family.\nI must remind you that it is not your own prudence or judgment that has\nenabled you to keep your place in the trade.”“Very likely not; but you have been no loser by my trade yet,” said Mr.\nVincy, thoroughly nettled (a result which was seldom much retarded by\nprevious resolutions). “And when you married Harriet, I don’t see how\nyou could expect that our families should not hang by the same nail. If\nyou’ve changed your mind, and want my family to come down in the world,\nyou’d better say so. I’ve never changed; I’m a plain Churchman now,\njust as I used to be before doctrines came up. I take the world as I\nfind it, in trade and everything else. I’m contented to be no worse\nthan my neighbors. But if you want us to come down in the world, say\nso.

You might as well slander Fred: it comes\npretty near to it when you refuse to say you didn’t set a slander\ngoing. It’s this sort of thing—this tyrannical spirit, wanting to play\nbishop and banker everywhere—it’s this sort of thing makes a man’s name\nstink.”“Vincy, if you insist on quarrelling with me, it will be exceedingly\npainful to Harriet as well as myself,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with a\ntrifle more eagerness and paleness than usual.“I don’t want to quarrel. It’s for my interest—and perhaps for yours\ntoo—that we should be friends. I bear you no grudge; I think no worse\nof you than I do of other people.

But a full-fed fountain will be generous with its waters even in\nthe rain, when they are worse than useless; and a fine fount of\nadmonition is apt to be equally irrepressible.It was not in Mr. Bulstrode’s nature to comply directly in consequence\nof uncomfortable suggestions. Before changing his course, he always\nneeded to shape his motives and bring them into accordance with his\nhabitual standard. He said, at last—“I will reflect a little, Vincy. I will mention the subject to Harriet.\nI shall probably send you a letter.”“Very well. As soon as you can, please. I hope it will all be settled\nbefore I see you to-morrow.”CHAPTER XIV.“Follows here the strict receipt\nFor that sauce to dainty meat,\nNamed Idleness, which many eat\nBy preference, and call it sweet:\n_First watch for morsels, like a hound\nMix well with buffets, stir them round\nWith good thick oil of flatteries, And froth with mean self-lauding\nlies.\nServe warm: the vessels you must choose\nTo keep it in are dead men’s shoes._”Mr. Bulstrode’s consultation of Harriet seemed to have had the effect\ndesired by Mr. Vincy, for early the next morning a letter came which\nFred could carry to Mr. Featherstone as the required testimony.The old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather,\nand as Mary Garth was not to be seen in the sitting-room, Fred went\nup-stairs immediately and presented the letter to his uncle, who,\npropped up comfortably on a bed-rest, was not less able than usual to\nenjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating\nmankind. He put on his spectacles to read the letter, pursing up his\nlips and drawing down their corners."

I promise nothing—I shall make codicils as long as I\nlike—_and that considering the nature of such a proceeding, it is\nunreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would\nattempt it_—ah, but the gentleman doesn’t say you are a young man of\nsense and character, mark you that, sir!—_As to my own concern with any\nreport of such a nature, I distinctly affirm that I never made any\nstatement to the effect that your son had borrowed money on any\nproperty that might accrue to him on Mr. Featherstone’s demise_—bless\nmy heart! ‘property’—accrue—demise! Lawyer Standish is nothing to him.\nHe couldn’t speak finer if he wanted to borrow. Well,” Mr. Featherstone\nhere looked over his spectacles at Fred, while he handed back the\nletter to him with a contemptuous gesture, “you don’t suppose I believe\na thing because Bulstrode writes it out fine, eh?”Fred colored. “You wished to have the letter, sir. I should think it\nvery likely that Mr. Bulstrode’s denial is as good as the authority\nwhich told you what he denies.”“Every bit. I never said I believed either one or the other. And now\nwhat d’ you expect?” said Mr. Featherstone, curtly, keeping on his\nspectacles, but withdrawing his hands under his wraps.“I expect nothing, sir.” Fred with difficulty restrained himself from\nventing his irritation. “I came to bring you the letter. If you like I\nwill bid you good morning.”“Not yet, not yet. Ring the bell; I want missy to come.”It was a servant who came in answer to the bell.“Tell missy to come!” said Mr. Featherstone, impatiently. “What\nbusiness had she to go away?” He spoke in the same tone when Mary came.“Why couldn’t you sit still here till I told you to go? I want my\nwaistcoat now. I told you always to put it on the bed.”Mary’s eyes looked rather red, as if she had been crying. It was clear\nthat Mr. Featherstone was in one of his most snappish humors this\nmorning, and though Fred had now the prospect of receiving the\nmuch-needed present of money, he would have preferred being free to\nturn round on the old tyrant and tell him that Mary Garth was too good\nto be at his beck. Though Fred had risen as she entered the room, she\nhad barely noticed him, and looked as if her nerves were quivering with\nthe expectation that something would be thrown at her. But she never\nhad anything worse than words to dread. When she went to reach the\nwaistcoat from a peg, Fred went up to her and said, “Allow me.”"

It was usual with him to season his\npleasure in showing favor to one person by being especially\ndisagreeable to another, and Mary was always at hand to furnish the\ncondiment. When his own relatives came she was treated better. Slowly\nhe took out a bunch of keys from the waistcoat pocket, and slowly he\ndrew forth a tin box which was under the bed-clothes.“You expect I am going to give you a little fortune, eh?” he said,\nlooking above his spectacles and pausing in the act of opening the lid.“Not at all, sir. You were good enough to speak of making me a present\nthe other day, else, of course, I should not have thought of the\nmatter.” But Fred was of a hopeful disposition, and a vision had\npresented itself of a sum just large enough to deliver him from a\ncertain anxiety. When Fred got into debt, it always seemed to him\nhighly probable that something or other—he did not necessarily conceive\nwhat—would come to pass enabling him to pay in due time. And now that\nthe providential occurrence was apparently close at hand, it would have\nbeen sheer absurdity to think that the supply would be short of the\nneed: as absurd as a faith that believed in half a miracle for want of\nstrength to believe in a whole one.The deep-veined hands fingered many bank-notes one after the other,\nlaying them down flat again, while Fred leaned back in his chair,\nscorning to look eager. He held himself to be a gentleman at heart, and\ndid not like courting an old fellow for his money. At last, Mr.\nFeatherstone eyed him again over his spectacles and presented him with\na little sheaf of notes: Fred could see distinctly that there were but\nfive, as the less significant edges gaped towards him. But then, each\nmight mean fifty pounds. He took them, saying—“I am very much obliged to you, sir,” and was going to roll them up\nwithout seeming to think of their value. But this did not suit Mr.\nFeatherstone, who was eying him intently.“Come, don’t you think it worth your while to count ’em? You take money\nlike a lord; I suppose you lose it like one.”“I thought I was not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, sir. But I\nshall be very happy to count them.”"

The collapse for Fred was severe when he found\nthat he held no more than five twenties, and his share in the higher\neducation of this country did not seem to help him. Nevertheless he\nsaid, with rapid changes in his fair complexion—“It is very handsome of you, sir.”“I should think it is,” said Mr. Featherstone, locking his box and\nreplacing it, then taking off his spectacles deliberately, and at\nlength, as if his inward meditation had more deeply convinced him,\nrepeating, “I should think it handsome.”“I assure you, sir, I am very grateful,” said Fred, who had had time to\nrecover his cheerful air.“So you ought to be. You want to cut a figure in the world, and I\nreckon Peter Featherstone is the only one you’ve got to trust to.” Here\nthe old man’s eyes gleamed with a curiously mingled satisfaction in the\nconsciousness that this smart young fellow relied upon him, and that\nthe smart young fellow was rather a fool for doing so.“Yes, indeed: I was not born to very splendid chances. Few men have\nbeen more cramped than I have been,” said Fred, with some sense of\nsurprise at his own virtue, considering how hardly he was dealt with.\n“It really seems a little too bad to have to ride a broken-winded\nhunter, and see men, who, are not half such good judges as yourself,\nable to throw away any amount of money on buying bad bargains.”“Well, you can buy yourself a fine hunter now.

You won’t\nget much out of his spekilations, I think. He’s got a pretty strong\nstring round your father’s leg, by what I hear, eh?”“My father never tells me anything about his affairs, sir.”“Well, he shows some sense there.

He longed to get out of the room, but he was a little\nashamed before his inner self, as well as before his uncle, to run away\nimmediately after pocketing the money.

She was certainly treating\nhim with more indifference than usual: she did not know how\naffectionately indignant he had felt on her behalf up-stairs.“May I stay here a little, Mary, or shall I bore you?”“Pray sit down,” said Mary; “you will not be so heavy a bore as Mr.\nJohn Waule, who was here yesterday, and he sat down without asking my\nleave.”“Poor fellow!

It is a shame you\nshould stay here to be bullied in that way.”“Oh, I have an easy life—by comparison. I have tried being a teacher,\nand I am not fit for that: my mind is too fond of wandering on its own\nway.

If you love me, you ought to\npromise to marry me.”“On the contrary, I think it would be wicked in me to marry you even if\nI did love you.”“You mean, just as I am, without any means of maintaining a wife. Of\ncourse: I am but three-and-twenty.”“In that last point you will alter. But I am not so sure of any other\nalteration. My father says an idle man ought not to exist, much less,\nbe married.”“Then I am to blow my brains out?”“No; on the whole I should think you would do better to pass your\nexamination. I have heard Mr. Farebrother say it is disgracefully\neasy.”“That is all very fine. Anything is easy to him. Not that cleverness\nhas anything to do with it. I am ten times cleverer than many men who\npass.”“Dear me!” said Mary, unable to repress her sarcasm; “that accounts for\nthe curates like Mr. Crowse. Divide your cleverness by ten, and the\nquotient—dear me!—is able to take a degree. But that only shows you are\nten times more idle than the others.”“Well, if I did pass, you would not want me to go into the Church?”“That is not the question—what I want you to do. You have a conscience\nof your own, I suppose. There! there is Mr. Lydgate. I must go and tell\nmy uncle.”“Mary,” said Fred, seizing her hand as she rose; “if you will not give\nme some encouragement, I shall get worse instead of better.”"

My father would think it a\ndisgrace to me if I accepted a man who got into debt, and would not\nwork!”Fred was stung, and released her hand. She walked to the door, but\nthere she turned and said: “Fred, you have always been so good, so\ngenerous to me. I am not ungrateful. But never speak to me in that way\nagain.”“Very well,” said Fred, sulkily, taking up his hat and whip. His\ncomplexion showed patches of pale pink and dead white. Like many a\nplucked idle young gentleman, he was thoroughly in love, and with a\nplain girl, who had no money! But having Mr. Featherstone’s land in the\nbackground, and a persuasion that, let Mary say what she would, she\nreally did care for him, Fred was not utterly in despair.When he got home, he gave four of the twenties to his mother, asking\nher to keep them for him. “I don’t want to spend that money, mother. I\nwant it to pay a debt with. So keep it safe away from my fingers.”“Bless you, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy. She doted on her eldest son and\nher youngest girl (a child of six), whom others thought her two\nnaughtiest children. The mother’s eyes are not always deceived in their\npartiality: she at least can best judge who is the tender,\nfilial-hearted child. And Fred was certainly very fond of his mother.\nPerhaps it was his fondness for another person also that made him\nparticularly anxious to take some security against his own liability to\nspend the hundred pounds. For the creditor to whom he owed a hundred\nand sixty held a firmer security in the shape of a bill signed by\nMary’s father.CHAPTER XV.“Black eyes you have left, you say,\n    Blue eyes fail to draw you;\nYet you seem more rapt to-day,\n    Than of old we saw you.“Oh, I track the fairest fair\n    Through new haunts of pleasure;\nFootprints here and echoes there\n    Guide me to my treasure:“Lo! she turns—immortal youth\n    Wrought to mortal stature,\nFresh as starlight’s aged truth—\n    Many-namèd Nature!”"

For surely all\nmust admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed,\ncounted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as\na future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown—known merely as a\ncluster of signs for his neighbors’ false suppositions. There was a\ngeneral impression, however, that Lydgate was not altogether a common\ncountry doctor, and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was\nsignificant of great things being expected from him. For everybody’s\nfamily doctor was remarkably clever, and was understood to have\nimmeasurable skill in the management and training of the most skittish\nor vicious diseases. The evidence of his cleverness was of the higher\nintuitive order, lying in his lady-patients’ immovable conviction, and\nwas unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were\nopposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw medical truth in\nWrench and “the strengthening treatment” regarding Toller and “the\nlowering system” as medical perdition. For the heroic times of copious\nbleeding and blistering had not yet departed, still less the times of\nthorough-going theory, when disease in general was called by some bad\nname, and treated accordingly without shilly-shally—as if, for example,\nit were to be called insurrection, which must not be fired on with\nblank-cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once. The strengtheners\nand the lowerers were all “clever” men in somebody’s opinion, which is\nreally as much as can be said for any living talents. Nobody’s\nimagination had gone so far as to conjecture that Mr. Lydgate could\nknow as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin, the two physicians, who\nalone could offer any hope when danger was extreme, and when the\nsmallest hope was worth a guinea. Still, I repeat, there was a general\nimpression that Lydgate was something rather more uncommon than any\ngeneral practitioner in Middlemarch. And this was true. He was but\nseven-and-twenty, an age at which many men are not quite common—at\nwhich they are hopeful of achievement, resolute in avoidance, thinking\nthat Mammon shall never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their\nbacks, but rather that Mammon, if they have anything to do with him,\nshall draw their chariot."

  "content": "He had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public school. His\nfather, a military man, had made but little provision for three\nchildren, and when the boy Tertius asked to have a medical education,\nit seemed easier to his guardians to grant his request by apprenticing\nhim to a country practitioner than to make any objections on the score\nof family dignity. He was one of the rarer lads who early get a decided\nbent and make up their minds that there is something particular in life\nwhich they would like to do for its own sake, and not because their\nfathers did it. Most of us who turn to any subject with love remember\nsome morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down\nan untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker,\nor for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the\nfirst traceable beginning of our love. Something of that sort happened\nto Lydgate. He was a quick fellow, and when hot from play, would toss\nhimself in a corner, and in five minutes be deep in any sort of book\nthat he could lay his hands on: if it were Rasselas or Gulliver, so\nmuch the better, but Bailey’s Dictionary would do, or the Bible with\nthe Apocrypha in it. Something he must read, when he was not riding the\npony, or running and hunting, or listening to the talk of men. All this\nwas true of him at ten years of age; he had then read through “Chrysal,\nor the Adventures of a Guinea,” which was neither milk for babes, nor\nany chalky mixture meant to pass for milk, and it had already occurred\nto him that books were stuff, and that life was stupid. His school\nstudies had not much modified that opinion, for though he “did” his\nclassics and mathematics, he was not pre-eminent in them. It was said\nof him, that Lydgate could do anything he liked, but he had certainly\nnot yet liked to do anything remarkable. He was a vigorous animal with\na ready understanding, but no spark had yet kindled in him an\nintellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him a very superficial\naffair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of his elders,\nhe had apparently got already more than was necessary for mature life.\nProbably this was not an exceptional result of expensive teaching at\nthat period of short-waisted coats, and other fashions which have not\nyet recurred. But, one vacation, a wet day sent him to the small home\nlibrary to hunt once more for a book which might have some freshness\nfor him: in vain! unless, indeed, he took down a dusty row of volumes\nwith gray-paper backs and dingy labels—the volumes of an old\nCyclopaedia which he had never disturbed. It would at least be a\nnovelty to disturb them. They were on the highest shelf, and he stood\non a chair to get them down. But he opened the volume which he first\ntook from the shelf: somehow, one is apt to read in a makeshift\nattitude, just where it might seem inconvenient to do so. The page he\nopened on was under the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that\ndrew his eyes was on the valves of the heart. He was not much\nacquainted with valves of any sort, but he knew that valvae were\nfolding-doors, and through this crevice came a sudden light startling\nhim with his first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the\nhuman frame. A liberal education had of course left him free to read\nthe indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general\nsense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal\nstructure, had left his imagination quite unbiassed, so that for\nanything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples, and he\nhad no more thought of representing to himself how his blood circulated\nthan how paper served instead of gold. But the moment of vocation had\ncome, and before he got down from his chair, the world was made new to\nhim by a presentiment of endless processes filling the vast spaces\nplanked out of his sight by that wordy ignorance which he had supposed\nto be knowledge. From that hour Lydgate felt the growth of an\nintellectual passion."

Is it due to excess of poetry or of stupidity that we\nare never weary of describing what King James called a woman’s “makdom\nand her fairnesse,” never weary of listening to the twanging of the old\nTroubadour strings, and are comparatively uninterested in that other\nkind of “makdom and fairnesse” which must be wooed with industrious\nthought and patient renunciation of small desires? In the story of this\npassion, too, the development varies: sometimes it is the glorious\nmarriage, sometimes frustration and final parting. And not seldom the\ncatastrophe is bound up with the other passion, sung by the\nTroubadours. For in the multitude of middle-aged men who go about their\nvocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as\nthe tie of their cravats, there is always a good number who once meant\nto shape their own deeds and alter the world a little. The story of\ntheir coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the\ngross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps\ntheir ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the\nardor of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked\nlike a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly.\nNothing in the world more subtle than the process of their gradual\nchange! In the beginning they inhaled it unknowingly: you and I may\nhave sent some of our breath towards infecting them, when we uttered\nour conforming falsities or drew our silly conclusions: or perhaps it\ncame with the vibrations from a woman’s glance."

Lydgate’s nature\ndemanded this combination: he was an emotional creature, with a\nflesh-and-blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the\nabstractions of special study. He cared not only for “cases,” but for\nJohn and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth."

  "content": "There was another attraction in his profession: it wanted reform, and\ngave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its\nvenal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine\nthough undemanded qualifications. He went to study in Paris with the\ndetermination that when he came home again he would settle in some\nprovincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the irrational\nseverance between medical and surgical knowledge in the interest of his\nown scientific pursuits, as well as of the general advance: he would\nkeep away from the range of London intrigues, jealousies, and social\ntruckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as Jenner had done, by\nthe independent value of his work. For it must be remembered that this\nwas a dark period; and in spite of venerable colleges which used great\nefforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it scarce, and to\nexclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation to fees and\nappointments, it happened that very ignorant young gentlemen were\npromoted in town, and many more got a legal right to practise over\nlarge areas in the country. Also, the high standard held up to the\npublic mind by the College of Physicians, which gave its peculiar\nsanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction\nobtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery\nfrom having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice\nchiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred\nthat it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could only\nbe got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic\nprescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees.\nConsidering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to\nthe number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist\nin the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the\nunits was the most direct mode of changing the numbers. He meant to be\na unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that\nspreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the\naverages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an\nadvantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients. But he did\nnot simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He\nwas ambitious of a wider effect: he was fired with the possibility that\nhe might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link\nin the chain of discovery."

Most of us, indeed, know little of the\ngreat originators until they have been lifted up among the\nconstellations and already rule our fates. But that Herschel, for\nexample, who “broke the barriers of the heavens”—did he not once play a\nprovincial church-organ, and give music-lessons to stumbling pianists?\nEach of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who\nperhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything\nwhich was to give him a title to everlasting fame: each of them had his\nlittle local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and\nsordid cares, which made the retarding friction of his course towards\nfinal companionship with the immortals. Lydgate was not blind to the\ndangers of such friction, but he had plenty of confidence in his\nresolution to avoid it as far as possible: being seven-and-twenty, he\nfelt himself experienced. And he was not going to have his vanities\nprovoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital,\nbut to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of\na great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice\nof his profession. There was fascination in the hope that the two\npurposes would illuminate each other: the careful observation and\ninference which was his daily work, the use of the lens to further his\njudgment in special cases, would further his thought as an instrument\nof larger inquiry. Was not this the typical pre-eminence of his\nprofession? He would be a good Middlemarch doctor, and by that very\nmeans keep himself in the track of far-reaching investigation. On one\npoint he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his\ncareer: he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make\na profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are\nexposing adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may\nhave leisure to represent the cause of public morality. He intended to\nbegin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite\ncertainly within his reach, and much less of a problem than the\ndemonstrating of an anatomical conception. One of these reforms was to\nact stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and simply\nprescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from\ndruggists. This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the\nstyle of general practitioner in a country town, and would be felt as\noffensive criticism by his professional brethren. But Lydgate meant to\ninnovate in his treatment also, and he was wise enough to see that the\nbest security for his practising honestly according to his belief was\nto get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary."
