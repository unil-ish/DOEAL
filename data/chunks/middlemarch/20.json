  "content": "“Queens hereafter might be glad to live\nUpon the alms of her superfluous praise.”But this result was questionable. And what else could he do for\nDorothea? What was his devotion worth to her? It was impossible to\ntell. He would not go out of her reach. He saw no creature among her\nfriends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same simple\nconfidence as to him. She had once said that she would like him to\nstay; and stay he would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss\naround her.This had always been the conclusion of Will’s hesitations. But he was\nnot without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own\nresolve. He had often got irritated, as he was on this particular\nnight, by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr.\nBrooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he would like them to be,\nand this was always associated with the other ground of irritation—that\nnotwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea’s sake, he could\nhardly ever see her. Whereupon, not being able to contradict these\nunpleasant facts, he contradicted his own strongest bias and said, “I\nam a fool.”Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea,\nhe ended, as he had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of\nwhat her presence would be to him; and suddenly reflecting that the\nmorrow would be Sunday, he determined to go to Lowick Church and see\nher. He slept upon that idea, but when he was dressing in the rational\nmorning light, Objection said—“That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon’s prohibition to visit\nLowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.”“Nonsense!” argued Inclination, “it would be too monstrous for him to\nhinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring\nmorning. And Dorothea will be glad.”“It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to annoy\nhim or to see Dorothea.”"

  "content": "“It is not true that I go to annoy him, and why should I not go to see\nDorothea? Is he to have everything to himself and be always\ncomfortable? Let him smart a little, as other people are obliged to do.\nI have always liked the quaintness of the church and congregation;\nbesides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into their pew.”Having silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to Lowick\nas if he had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell Common and\nskirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding\nboughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green\ngrowths piercing the brown. Everything seemed to know that it was\nSunday, and to approve of his going to Lowick Church. Will easily felt\nhappy when nothing crossed his humor, and by this time the thought of\nvexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him, making his face\nbreak into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine\non the water—though the occasion was not exemplary. But most of us are\napt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is\nodious, and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his\npersonality excites in ourselves. Will went along with a small book\nunder his arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but\nchanting a little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and\ncoming out. He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his\nown, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. The\nwords were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday\nexperience:—“O me, O me, what frugal cheer\n    My love doth feed upon!\nA touch, a ray, that is not here,\n    A shadow that is gone:“A dream of breath that might be near,\n    An inly-echoed tone,\nThe thought that one may think me dear,\n    The place where one was known,“The tremor of a banished fear,\n     An ill that was not done—\nO me, O me, what frugal cheer\n    My love doth feed upon!”Sometimes, when he took off his hat, shaking his head backward, and\nshowing his delicate throat as he sang, he looked like an incarnation\nof the spring whose spirit filled the air—a bright creature, abundant\nin uncertain promises."

But he was still\nleft alone in it when the congregation had assembled. The curate’s pew\nwas opposite the rector’s at the entrance of the small chancel, and\nWill had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked\nround at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year\nto year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with\nmore change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and\nthere with age, but yet has young shoots. Mr. Rigg’s frog-face was\nsomething alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to\nthe order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of\nthe Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel’s cheek had\nthe same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent\ncottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters\ngenerally—the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the\nblack gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all\nbetters, and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was at\npeace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the\nSunday sermon. The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church\nin former days, and no one took much note of him except the choir, who\nexpected him to make a figure in the singing.Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking up the\nshort aisle in her white beaver bonnet and gray cloak—the same she had\nworn in the Vatican. Her face being, from her entrance, towards the\nchancel, even her shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will, but there was\nno outward show of her feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow\nas she passed him. To his own surprise Will felt suddenly\nuncomfortable, and dared not look at her after they had bowed to each\nother. Two minutes later, when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry,\nand, entering the pew, seated himself in face of Dorothea, Will felt\nhis paralysis more complete. He could look nowhere except at the choir\nin the little gallery over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps\npained, and he had made a wretched blunder. It was no longer amusing to\nvex Mr. Casaubon, who had the advantage probably of watching him and\nseeing that he dared not turn his head. Why had he not imagined this\nbeforehand?—but he could not expect that he should sit in that square\npew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently departed from\nLowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the desk. Still he called\nhimself stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be impossible for\nhim to look towards Dorothea—nay, that she might feel his coming an\nimpertinence. There was no delivering himself from his cage, however;\nand Will found his places and looked at his book as if he had been a\nschool-mistress, feeling that the morning service had never been so\nimmeasurably long before, that he was utterly ridiculous, out of\ntemper, and miserable. This was what a man got by worshipping the sight\nof a woman! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr. Ladislaw did not\njoin in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that he might have a cold."

  "content": "Mr. Casaubon did not preach that morning, and there was no change in\nWill’s situation until the blessing had been pronounced and every one\nrose. It was the fashion at Lowick for “the betters” to go out first.\nWith a sudden determination to break the spell that was upon him, Will\nlooked straight at Mr. Casaubon. But that gentleman’s eyes were on the\nbutton of the pew-door, which he opened, allowing Dorothea to pass, and\nfollowing her immediately without raising his eyelids. Will’s glance\nhad caught Dorothea’s as she turned out of the pew, and again she\nbowed, but this time with a look of agitation, as if she were\nrepressing tears. Will walked out after them, but they went on towards\nthe little gate leading out of the churchyard into the shrubbery, never\nlooking round.It was impossible for him to follow them, and he could only walk back\nsadly at mid-day along the same road which he had trodden hopefully in\nthe morning. The lights were all changed for him both without and\nwithin.CHAPTER XLVIII.Surely the golden hours are turning gray\nAnd dance no more, and vainly strive to run:\nI see their white locks streaming in the wind—\nEach face is haggard as it looks at me,\nSlow turning in the constant clasping round\nStorm-driven.Dorothea’s distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly from\nthe perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to his\ncousin, and that Will’s presence at church had served to mark more\nstrongly the alienation between them. Will’s coming seemed to her quite\nexcusable, nay, she thought it an amiable movement in him towards a\nreconciliation which she herself had been constantly wishing for. He\nhad probably imagined, as she had, that if Mr. Casaubon and he could\nmeet easily, they would shake hands and friendly intercourse might\nreturn. But now Dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope. Will was\nbanished further than ever, for Mr. Casaubon must have been newly\nembittered by this thrusting upon him of a presence which he refused to\nrecognize."

  "content": "He had not been very well that morning, suffering from some difficulty\nin breathing, and had not preached in consequence; she was not\nsurprised, therefore, that he was nearly silent at luncheon, still less\nthat he made no allusion to Will Ladislaw. For her own part she felt\nthat she could never again introduce that subject. They usually spent\napart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon\nin the library dozing chiefly, and Dorothea in her boudoir, where she\nwas wont to occupy herself with some of her favorite books. There was a\nlittle heap of them on the table in the bow-window—of various sorts,\nfrom Herodotus, which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to\nher old companion Pascal, and Keble’s “Christian Year.” But to-day she\nopened one after another, and could read none of them. Everything\nseemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus—Jewish\nantiquities—oh dear!—devout epigrams—the sacred chime of favorite\nhymns—all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring\nflowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon\nclouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which\nhad become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future\ndays in which she would still live with them for her sole companions.\nIt was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor\nDorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual\neffort demanded by her married life. She was always trying to be what\nher husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she\nwas. The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have,\nseemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted\nand not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied. About\nWill Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first,\nand it had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed\nDorothea’s strong feeling about his claims on the family property, by\nher being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the\nwrong, but that she was helpless. This afternoon the helplessness was\nmore wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could\nbe dear to her, and to whom she could be dear. She longed for work\nwhich would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and\nnow it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb,\nwhere there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would\nnever see the light. Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and\nseen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and\nfellowship—turning his face towards her as he went."

It was Sunday, and she\ncould not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had a baby.\nThere was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent, and\nDorothea had to bear her bad mood, as she would have borne a headache.After dinner, at the hour when she usually began to read aloud, Mr.\nCasaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where, he said,\nhe had ordered a fire and lights. He seemed to have revived, and to be\nthinking intently.In the library Dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a row of\nhis note-books on a table, and now he took up and put into her hand a\nwell-known volume, which was a table of contents to all the others.“You will oblige me, my dear,” he said, seating himself, “if instead of\nother reading this evening, you will go through this aloud, pencil in\nhand, and at each point where I say ‘mark,’ will make a cross with your\npencil. This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long\nhad in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain\nprinciples of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent\nparticipation in my purpose.”This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable\ninterview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon’s original reluctance to let\nDorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition,\nnamely, to demand much interest and labor from her.After she had read and marked for two hours, he said, “We will take the\nvolume up-stairs—and the pencil, if you please—and in case of reading\nin the night, we can pursue this task. It is not wearisome to you, I\ntrust, Dorothea?”“I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,” said Dorothea,\nwho told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in\nreading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever."

  "content": "It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in\nDorothea impressed those around her, that her husband, with all his\njealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of\nher promises, and her power of devoting herself to her idea of the\nright and best. Of late he had begun to feel that these qualities were\na peculiar possession for himself, and he wanted to engross them.The reading in the night did come. Dorothea in her young weariness had\nslept soon and fast: she was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed\nto her at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she had climbed a\nsteep hill: she opened her eyes and saw her husband wrapped in his warm\ngown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the\nembers were still glowing. He had lit two candles, expecting that\nDorothea would awake, but not liking to rouse her by more direct means.“Are you ill, Edward?” she said, rising immediately.“I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture. I will sit here for a\ntime.” She threw wood on the fire, wrapped herself up, and said, “You\nwould like me to read to you?”“You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon,\nwith a shade more meekness than usual in his polite manner. “I am\nwakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid.”“I fear that the excitement may be too great for you,” said Dorothea,\nremembering Lydgate’s cautions.“No, I am not conscious of undue excitement. Thought is easy.” Dorothea\ndared not insist, and she read for an hour or more on the same plan as\nshe had done in the evening, but getting over the pages with more\nquickness. Mr. Casaubon’s mind was more alert, and he seemed to\nanticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication,\nsaying, “That will do—mark that”—or “Pass on to the next head—I omit\nthe second excursus on Crete.” Dorothea was amazed to think of the\nbird-like speed with which his mind was surveying the ground where it\nhad been creeping for years. At last he said—“Close the book now, my dear. We will resume our work to-morrow. I have\ndeferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed. But you\nobserve that the principle on which my selection is made, is to give\nadequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the theses\nenumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched. You have\nperceived that distinctly, Dorothea?”"

  "content": "“Yes,” said Dorothea, rather tremulously. She felt sick at heart.“And now I think that I can take some repose,” said Mr. Casaubon. He\nlaid down again and begged her to put out the lights. When she had lain\ndown too, and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on the\nhearth, he said—“Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea.”“What is it?” said Dorothea, with dread in her mind.“It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my\ndeath, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what\nI should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.”Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading her\nto the conjecture of some intention on her husband’s part which might\nmake a new yoke for her. She did not answer immediately.“You refuse?” said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his tone.“No, I do not yet refuse,” said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the need of\nfreedom asserting itself within her; “but it is too solemn—I think it\nis not right—to make a promise when I am ignorant what it will bind me\nto. Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising.”“But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you\nrefuse.”“No, dear, no!” said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.\n“But may I wait and reflect a little while? I desire with my whole soul\nto do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any pledge\nsuddenly—still less a pledge to do I know not what.”“You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?”“Grant me till to-morrow,” said Dorothea, beseechingly.“Till to-morrow then,” said Mr. Casaubon."

While she constrained herself to lie still lest she should\ndisturb him, her mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination\nranged its forces first on one side and then on the other. She had no\npresentiment that the power which her husband wished to establish over\nher future action had relation to anything else than his work. But it\nwas clear enough to her that he would expect her to devote herself to\nsifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the doubtful\nillustration of principles still more doubtful. The poor child had\nbecome altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key\nwhich had made the ambition and the labor of her husband’s life. It was\nnot wonderful that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment in\nthis matter was truer than his: for she looked with unbiassed\ncomparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had risked\nall his egoism. And now she pictured to herself the days, and months,\nand years which she must spend in sorting what might be called\nshattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a\nmosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for a theory\nwhich was already withered in the birth like an elfin child. Doubtless\na vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth\na-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of\nsubstances, the body of chemistry is prepared for its soul, and\nLavoisier is born. But Mr. Casaubon’s theory of the elements which made\nthe seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares\nagainst discoveries: it floated among flexible conjectures no more\nsolid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in\nsound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible:\nit was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity\nof forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate\nnotion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for\nthreading the stars together. And Dorothea had so often had to check\nher weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as\nit revealed itself to her instead of the fellowship in high knowledge\nwhich was to make life worthier! She could understand well enough now\nwhy her husband had come to cling to her, as possibly the only hope\nleft that his labors would ever take a shape in which they could be\ngiven to the world. At first it had seemed that he wished to keep even\nher aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing; but gradually\nthe terrible stringency of human need—the prospect of a too speedy\ndeath—"

  "content": "And here Dorothea’s pity turned from her own future to her husband’s\npast—nay, to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out\nof that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the\npressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs;\nand now at last the sword visibly trembling above him! And had she not\nwished to marry him that she might help him in his life’s labor?—But\nshe had thought the work was to be something greater, which she could\nserve in devoutly for its own sake. Was it right, even to soothe his\ngrief—would it be possible, even if she promised—to work as in a\ntreadmill fruitlessly?And yet, could she deny him? Could she say, “I refuse to content this\npining hunger?” It would be refusing to do for him dead, what she was\nalmost sure to do for him living. If he lived as Lydgate had said he\nmight, for fifteen years or more, her life would certainly be spent in\nhelping him and obeying him.Still, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living\nand that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead. While he lived, he\ncould claim nothing that she would not still be free to remonstrate\nagainst, and even to refuse. But—the thought passed through her mind\nmore than once, though she could not believe in it—might he not mean to\ndemand something more from her than she had been able to imagine, since\nhe wanted her pledge to carry out his wishes without telling her\nexactly what they were? No; his heart was bound up in his work only:\nthat was the end for which his failing life was to be eked out by hers.And now, if she were to say, “No! if you die, I will put no finger to\nyour work”—it seemed as if she would be crushing that bruised heart."

  "content": "For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she felt ill and\nbewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely. Helpless as a child\nwhich has sobbed and sought too long, she fell into a late morning\nsleep, and when she waked Mr. Casaubon was already up. Tantripp told\nher that he had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in the library.“I never saw you look so pale, madam,” said Tantripp, a solid-figured\nwoman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.“Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?” said Dorothea, smiling faintly.“Well, not to say high-colored, but with a bloom like a Chiny rose. But\nalways smelling those leather books, what can be expected? Do rest a\nlittle this morning, madam. Let me say you are ill and not able to go\ninto that close library.”“Oh no, no! let me make haste,” said Dorothea. “Mr. Casaubon wants me\nparticularly.”When she went down she felt sure that she should promise to fulfil his\nwishes; but that would be later in the day—not yet.As Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from the\ntable where he had been placing some books, and said—“I was waiting for your appearance, my dear. I had hoped to set to work\nat once this morning, but I find myself under some indisposition,\nprobably from too much excitement yesterday. I am going now to take a\nturn in the shrubbery, since the air is milder.”“I am glad to hear that,” said Dorothea. “Your mind, I feared, was too\nactive last night.”“I would fain have it set at rest on the point I last spoke of,\nDorothea. You can now, I hope, give me an answer.”“May I come out to you in the garden presently?” said Dorothea, winning\na little breathing space in that way.“I shall be in the Yew-tree Walk for the next half-hour,” said Mr.\nCasaubon, and then he left her.Dorothea, feeling very weary, rang and asked Tantripp to bring her some\nwraps. She had been sitting still for a few minutes, but not in any\nrenewal of the former conflict: she simply felt that she was going to\nsay “Yes” to her own doom: she was too weak, too full of dread at the\nthought of inflicting a keen-edged blow on her husband, to do anything\nbut submit completely. She sat still and let Tantripp put on her bonnet\nand shawl, a passivity which was unusual with her, for she liked to\nwait on herself."

But soon she checked\nherself, dried her eyes, and went out at the glass door into the\nshrubbery.“I wish every book in that library was built into a caticom for your\nmaster,” said Tantripp to Pratt, the butler, finding him in the\nbreakfast-room. She had been at Rome, and visited the antiquities, as\nwe know; and she always declined to call Mr. Casaubon anything but\n“your master,” when speaking to the other servants.Pratt laughed. He liked his master very well, but he liked Tantripp\nbetter.When Dorothea was out on the gravel walks, she lingered among the\nnearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as she had done once before, though\nfrom a different cause. Then she had feared lest her effort at\nfellowship should be unwelcome; now she dreaded going to the spot where\nshe foresaw that she must bind herself to a fellowship from which she\nshrank. Neither law nor the world’s opinion compelled her to this—only\nher husband’s nature and her own compassion, only the ideal and not the\nreal yoke of marriage. She saw clearly enough the whole situation, yet\nshe was fettered: she could not smite the stricken soul that entreated\nhers. If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak. But the half-hour was\npassing, and she must not delay longer. When she entered the Yew-tree\nWalk she could not see her husband; but the walk had bends, and she\nwent, expecting to catch sight of his figure wrapped in a blue cloak,\nwhich, with a warm velvet cap, was his outer garment on chill days for\nthe garden. It occurred to her that he might be resting in the\nsummer-house, towards which the path diverged a little. Turning the\nangle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a stone table.\nHis arms were resting on the table, and his brow was bowed down on\nthem, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening his face on\neach side."

But then she remembered that of late she had seen him\ntake that attitude when she was reading to him, as if he found it\neasier than any other; and that he would sometimes speak, as well as\nlisten, with his face down in that way. She went into the summerhouse\nand said, “I am come, Edward; I am ready.”He took no notice, and she thought that he must be fast asleep. She\nlaid her hand on his shoulder, and repeated, “I am ready!” Still he was\nmotionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she leaned down to him,\ntook off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying\nin a distressed tone—“Wake, dear, wake! Listen to me. I am come to answer.” But Dorothea\nnever gave her answer.Later in the day, Lydgate was seated by her bedside, and she was\ntalking deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone\nthrough her mind the night before. She knew him, and called him by his\nname, but appeared to think it right that she should explain everything\nto him; and again, and again, begged him to explain everything to her\nhusband.“Tell him I shall go to him soon: I am ready to promise. Only, thinking\nabout it was so dreadful—it has made me ill. Not very ill. I shall soon\nbe better. Go and tell him.”But the silence in her husband’s ear was never more to be broken.CHAPTER XLIX.“A task too strong for wizard spells\nThis squire had brought about;\n’T is easy dropping stones in wells,\nBut who shall get them out?”“I wish to God we could hinder Dorothea from knowing this,” said Sir\nJames Chettam, with a little frown on his brow, and an expression of\nintense disgust about his mouth.He was standing on the hearth-rug in the library at Lowick Grange, and\nspeaking to Mr. Brooke. It was the day after Mr. Casaubon had been\nburied, and Dorothea was not yet able to leave her room.“That would be difficult, you know, Chettam, as she is an executrix,\nand she likes to go into these things—property, land, that kind of\nthing. She has her notions, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, sticking his\neye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the edges of a folded paper\nwhich he held in his hand; “and she would like to act—depend upon it,\nas an executrix Dorothea would want to act. And she was twenty-one last\nDecember, you know. I can hinder nothing.”"

Until Dorothea is well, all business must be\nkept from her, and as soon as she is able to be moved she must come to\nus. Being with Celia and the baby will be the best thing in the world\nfor her, and will pass away the time. And meanwhile you must get rid of\nLadislaw: you must send him out of the country.” Here Sir James’s look\nof disgust returned in all its intensity.Mr. Brooke put his hands behind him, walked to the window and\nstraightened his back with a little shake before he replied.“That is easily said, Chettam, easily said, you know.”“My dear sir,” persisted Sir James, restraining his indignation within\nrespectful forms, “it was you who brought him here, and you who keep\nhim here—I mean by the occupation you give him.”“Yes, but I can’t dismiss him in an instant without assigning reasons,\nmy dear Chettam. Ladislaw has been invaluable, most satisfactory. I\nconsider that I have done this part of the country a service by\nbringing him—by bringing him, you know.” Mr. Brooke ended with a nod,\nturning round to give it.“It’s a pity this part of the country didn’t do without him, that’s all\nI have to say about it. At any rate, as Dorothea’s brother-in-law, I\nfeel warranted in objecting strongly to his being kept here by any\naction on the part of her friends. You admit, I hope, that I have a\nright to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife’s sister?”Sir James was getting warm.“Of course, my dear Chettam, of course. But you and I have different\nideas—different—”“Not about this action of Casaubon’s, I should hope,” interrupted Sir\nJames. “I say that he has most unfairly compromised Dorothea. I say\nthat there never was a meaner, more ungentlemanly action than this—a\ncodicil of this sort to a will which he made at the time of his\nmarriage with the knowledge and reliance of her family—a positive\ninsult to Dorothea!”“Well, you know, Casaubon was a little twisted about Ladislaw. Ladislaw\nhas told me the reason—dislike of the bent he took, you know—Ladislaw\ndidn’t think much of Casaubon’s notions, Thoth and Dagon—that sort of\nthing: and I fancy that Casaubon didn’t like the independent position\nLadislaw had taken up. I saw the letters between them, you know. Poor\nCasaubon was a little buried in books—he didn’t know the world.”"

This paper, now, ‘Synoptical\nTabulation’ and so on, ‘for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,’ it was locked up\nin the desk with the will. I suppose he meant Dorothea to publish his\nresearches, eh? and she’ll do it, you know; she has gone into his\nstudies uncommonly.”“My dear sir,” said Sir James, impatiently, “that is neither here nor\nthere. The question is, whether you don’t see with me the propriety of\nsending young Ladislaw away?”“Well, no, not the urgency of the thing. By-and-by, perhaps, it may\ncome round. As to gossip, you know, sending him away won’t hinder\ngossip. People say what they like to say, not what they have chapter\nand verse for,” said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that\nlay on the side of his own wishes. “I might get rid of Ladislaw up to a\ncertain point—take away the ‘Pioneer’ from him, and that sort of thing;\nbut I couldn’t send him out of the country if he didn’t choose to\ngo—didn’t choose, you know.”Mr. Brooke, persisting as quietly as if he were only discussing the\nnature of last year’s weather, and nodding at the end with his usual\namenity, was an exasperating form of obstinacy.“Good God!” said Sir James, with as much passion as he ever showed,\n“let us get him a post; let us spend money on him. If he could go in\nthe suite of some Colonial Governor! Grampus might take him—and I could\nwrite to Fulke about it.”“But Ladislaw won’t be shipped off like a head of cattle, my dear\nfellow; Ladislaw has his ideas. It’s my opinion that if he were to part\nfrom me to-morrow, you’d only hear the more of him in the country. With\nhis talent for speaking and drawing up documents, there are few men who\ncould come up to him as an agitator—an agitator, you know.”"

Dorothea, now. As you say, she had better\ngo to Celia as soon as possible. She can stay under your roof, and in\nthe mean time things may come round quietly. Don’t let us be firing off\nour guns in a hurry, you know. Standish will keep our counsel, and the\nnews will be old before it’s known. Twenty things may happen to carry\noff Ladislaw—without my doing anything, you know.”“Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?”“Decline, Chettam?—no—I didn’t say decline. But I really don’t see what\nI could do. Ladislaw is a gentleman.”“I am glad to hear it!” said Sir James, his irritation making him\nforget himself a little. “I am sure Casaubon was not.”“Well, it would have been worse if he had made the codicil to hinder\nher from marrying again at all, you know.”“I don’t know that,” said Sir James. “It would have been less\nindelicate.”“One of poor Casaubon’s freaks! That attack upset his brain a little.\nIt all goes for nothing. She doesn’t _want_ to marry Ladislaw.”“But this codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that she\ndid. I don’t believe anything of the sort about Dorothea,” said Sir\nJames—then frowningly, “but I suspect Ladislaw. I tell you frankly, I\nsuspect Ladislaw.”“I couldn’t take any immediate action on that ground, Chettam. In fact,\nif it were possible to pack him off—send him to Norfolk Island—that\nsort of thing—it would look all the worse for Dorothea to those who\nknew about it. It would seem as if we distrusted her—distrusted her,\nyou know.”That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend to\nsoothe Sir James. He put out his hand to reach his hat, implying that\nhe did not mean to contend further, and said, still with some heat—“Well, I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once,\nbecause her friends were too careless. I shall do what I can, as her\nbrother, to protect her now.”"

It would have been highly inconvenient to\nhim to part with Ladislaw at that time, when a dissolution might happen\nany day, and electors were to be convinced of the course by which the\ninterests of the country would be best served. Mr. Brooke sincerely\nbelieved that this end could be secured by his own return to\nParliament: he offered the forces of his mind honestly to the nation.CHAPTER L.“This Loller here wol precilen us somewhat.”\n“Nay by my father’s soule! that schal he nat,”\nSayde the Schipman, ‘here schal he not preche,\nWe schal no gospel glosen here ne teche.\nWe leven all in the gret God,’ quod he.\nHe wolden sowen some diffcultee.”—_Canterbury Tales_.Dorothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before she had\nasked any dangerous questions. Every morning now she sat with Celia in\nthe prettiest of up-stairs sitting-rooms, opening into a small\nconservatory—Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of mixed\nviolets, watching the remarkable acts of the baby, which were so\ndubious to her inexperienced mind that all conversation was interrupted\nby appeals for their interpretation made to the oracular nurse.\nDorothea sat by in her widow’s dress, with an expression which rather\nprovoked Celia, as being much too sad; for not only was baby quite\nwell, but really when a husband had been so dull and troublesome while\nhe lived, and besides that had—well, well! Sir James, of course, had\ntold Celia everything, with a strong representation how important it\nwas that Dorothea should not know it sooner than was inevitable.But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not\nlong remain passive where action had been assigned to her; she knew the\npurport of her husband’s will made at the time of their marriage, and\nher mind, as soon as she was clearly conscious of her position, was\nsilently occupied with what she ought to do as the owner of Lowick\nManor with the patronage of the living attached to it.One morning when her uncle paid his usual visit, though with an unusual\nalacrity in his manner which he accounted for by saying that it was now\npretty certain Parliament would be dissolved forthwith, Dorothea said—"

After Mr. Tucker had been provided for, I never heard\nmy husband say that he had any clergyman in his mind as a successor to\nhimself. I think I ought to have the keys now and go to Lowick to\nexamine all my husband’s papers. There may be something that would\nthrow light on his wishes.”“No hurry, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, quietly. “By-and-by, you know,\nyou can go, if you like. But I cast my eyes over things in the desks\nand drawers—there was nothing—nothing but deep subjects, you\nknow—besides the will. Everything can be done by-and-by. As to the\nliving, I have had an application for interest already—I should say\nrather good. Mr. Tyke has been strongly recommended to me—I had\nsomething to do with getting him an appointment before. An apostolic\nman, I believe—the sort of thing that would suit you, my dear.”“I should like to have fuller knowledge about him, uncle, and judge for\nmyself, if Mr. Casaubon has not left any expression of his wishes. He\nhas perhaps made some addition to his will—there may be some\ninstructions for me,” said Dorothea, who had all the while had this\nconjecture in her mind with relation to her husband’s work.“Nothing about the rectory, my dear—nothing,” said Mr. Brooke, rising\nto go away, and putting out his hand to his nieces: “nor about his\nresearches, you know. Nothing in the will.”Dorothea’s lip quivered.“Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear. By-and-by, you\nknow.”“I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert myself.”“Well, well, we shall see. But I must run away now—I have no end of\nwork now—it’s a crisis—a political crisis, you know. And here is Celia\nand her little man—you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a sort of\ngrandfather,” said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious to get away\nand tell Chettam that it would not be his (Mr. Brooke’s) fault if\nDorothea insisted on looking into everything.Dorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the room, and\ncast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands.“Look, Dodo! look at him! Did you ever see anything like that?” said\nCelia, in her comfortable staccato.“What, Kitty?” said Dorothea, lifting her eyes rather absently."

Do look at him.”A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down\nDorothea’s cheek as she looked up and tried to smile.“Don’t be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I am\nsure you did everything, and a great deal too much. You should be happy\nnow.”“I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look over\neverything—to see if there were any words written for me.”“You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he has not\nsaid so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the\ngallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual,\nDodo—I can see that: it vexes me.”“Where am I wrong, Kitty?” said Dorothea, quite meekly. She was almost\nready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering\nwith some fear what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her advantage, and\nwas determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as well as she did, or\nknew how to manage her. Since Celia’s baby was born, she had had a new\nsense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed clear that\nwhere there was a baby, things were right enough, and that error, in\ngeneral, was a mere lack of that central poising force.“I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,” said\nCelia. “You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable\nfor you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had\nnot been uncomfortable enough before. And he doesn’t deserve it, and\nyou will find that out. He has behaved very badly. James is as angry\nwith him as can be. And I had better tell you, to prepare you.”“Celia,” said Dorothea, entreatingly, “you distress me. Tell me at once\nwhat you mean.” It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon had left\nthe property away from her—which would not be so very distressing.“Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was all to\ngo away from you if you married—I mean—”“That is of no consequence,” said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously."

But Celia was\nadministering what she thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking\nup notions that had done Dodo’s health so much harm. So she went on in\nher neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on baby’s robes.“James says so. He says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman. And\nthere never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon\nwanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr.\nLadislaw—which is ridiculous. Only James says it was to hinder Mr.\nLadislaw from wanting to marry you for your money—just as if he ever\nwould think of making you an offer. Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as\nwell marry an Italian with white mice! But I must just go and look at\nbaby,” Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light\nshawl over her, and tripping away."

She might have compared her experience at that\nmoment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on\na new form, that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory\nwould not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs. Everything was\nchanging its aspect: her husband’s conduct, her own duteous feeling\ntowards him, every struggle between them—and yet more, her whole\nrelation to Will Ladislaw. Her world was in a state of convulsive\nchange; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself was, that\nshe must wait and think anew. One change terrified her as if it had\nbeen a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed\nhusband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she\nsaid and did. Then again she was conscious of another change which also\nmade her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards\nWill Ladislaw. It had never before entered her mind that he could,\nunder any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the effect of the\nsudden revelation that another had thought of him in that light—that\nperhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and this\nwith the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and\nquestions not soon to be solved.It seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she heard Celia\nsaying, “That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now. You can\ngo to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room. What I think,\nDodo,” Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea was\nleaning back in her chair, and likely to be passive, “is that Mr.\nCasaubon was spiteful. I never did like him, and James never did. I\nthink the corners of his mouth were dreadfully spiteful. And now he has\nbehaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to make\nyourself uncomfortable about him. If he has been taken away, that is a\nmercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should we,\nbaby?” said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise\nof the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to\nthe nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to\nmake—you didn’t know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western form.At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he\nsaid was, “I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have\nyou been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.” Dorothea’s hand was of\na marble coldness.“She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,” said Celia. “She\nought not, ought she?”Lydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he said, looking at\nDorothea. “I hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what\nwould give her the most repose of mind. That repose will not always\ncome from being forbidden to act.”"

Why should I sit\nhere idle?” Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with\nher agitation, she added, abruptly, “You know every one in Middlemarch,\nI think, Mr. Lydgate. I shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have\nserious things to do now. I have a living to give away. You know Mr.\nTyke and all the—” But Dorothea’s effort was too much for her; she\nbroke off and burst into sobs.Lydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.“Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,” he said to Sir James, whom he\nasked to see before quitting the house. “She wants perfect freedom, I\nthink, more than any other prescription.”His attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had enabled him\nto form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life. He\nfelt sure that she had been suffering from the strain and conflict of\nself-repression; and that she was likely now to feel herself only in\nanother sort of pinfold than that from which she had been released.Lydgate’s advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he\nfound that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about\nthe will. There was no help for it now—no reason for any further delay\nin the execution of necessary business. And the next day Sir James\ncomplied at once with her request that he would drive her to Lowick.“I have no wish to stay there at present,” said Dorothea; “I could\nhardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be\nable to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at\nit from a distance. And I should like to be at the Grange a little\nwhile with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the\npeople in the village.”"
