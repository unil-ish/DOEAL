This paper, now, ‘Synoptical\nTabulation’ and so on, ‘for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,’ it was locked up\nin the desk with the will. I suppose he meant Dorothea to publish his\nresearches, eh? and she’ll do it, you know; she has gone into his\nstudies uncommonly.”“My dear sir,” said Sir James, impatiently, “that is neither here nor\nthere. The question is, whether you don’t see with me the propriety of\nsending young Ladislaw away?”“Well, no, not the urgency of the thing. By-and-by, perhaps, it may\ncome round. As to gossip, you know, sending him away won’t hinder\ngossip. People say what they like to say, not what they have chapter\nand verse for,” said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that\nlay on the side of his own wishes. “I might get rid of Ladislaw up to a\ncertain point—take away the ‘Pioneer’ from him, and that sort of thing;\nbut I couldn’t send him out of the country if he didn’t choose to\ngo—didn’t choose, you know.”Mr. Brooke, persisting as quietly as if he were only discussing the\nnature of last year’s weather, and nodding at the end with his usual\namenity, was an exasperating form of obstinacy.“Good God!” said Sir James, with as much passion as he ever showed,\n“let us get him a post; let us spend money on him. If he could go in\nthe suite of some Colonial Governor! Grampus might take him—and I could\nwrite to Fulke about it.”“But Ladislaw won’t be shipped off like a head of cattle, my dear\nfellow; Ladislaw has his ideas. It’s my opinion that if he were to part\nfrom me to-morrow, you’d only hear the more of him in the country. With\nhis talent for speaking and drawing up documents, there are few men who\ncould come up to him as an agitator—an agitator, you know.”"

  "content": "“Agitator!” said Sir James, with bitter emphasis, feeling that the\nsyllables of this word properly repeated were a sufficient exposure of\nits hatefulness.“But be reasonable, Chettam. Dorothea, now. As you say, she had better\ngo to Celia as soon as possible. She can stay under your roof, and in\nthe mean time things may come round quietly. Don’t let us be firing off\nour guns in a hurry, you know. Standish will keep our counsel, and the\nnews will be old before it’s known. Twenty things may happen to carry\noff Ladislaw—without my doing anything, you know.”“Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?”“Decline, Chettam?—no—I didn’t say decline. But I really don’t see what\nI could do. Ladislaw is a gentleman.”“I am glad to hear it!” said Sir James, his irritation making him\nforget himself a little. “I am sure Casaubon was not.”“Well, it would have been worse if he had made the codicil to hinder\nher from marrying again at all, you know.”“I don’t know that,” said Sir James. “It would have been less\nindelicate.”“One of poor Casaubon’s freaks! That attack upset his brain a little.\nIt all goes for nothing. She doesn’t _want_ to marry Ladislaw.”“But this codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that she\ndid. I don’t believe anything of the sort about Dorothea,” said Sir\nJames—then frowningly, “but I suspect Ladislaw. I tell you frankly, I\nsuspect Ladislaw.”“I couldn’t take any immediate action on that ground, Chettam. In fact,\nif it were possible to pack him off—send him to Norfolk Island—that\nsort of thing—it would look all the worse for Dorothea to those who\nknew about it. It would seem as if we distrusted her—distrusted her,\nyou know.”That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend to\nsoothe Sir James. He put out his hand to reach his hat, implying that\nhe did not mean to contend further, and said, still with some heat—“Well, I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once,\nbecause her friends were too careless. I shall do what I can, as her\nbrother, to protect her now.”"

  "content": "“You can’t do better than get her to Freshitt as soon as possible,\nChettam. I approve that plan altogether,” said Mr. Brooke, well pleased\nthat he had won the argument. It would have been highly inconvenient to\nhim to part with Ladislaw at that time, when a dissolution might happen\nany day, and electors were to be convinced of the course by which the\ninterests of the country would be best served. Mr. Brooke sincerely\nbelieved that this end could be secured by his own return to\nParliament: he offered the forces of his mind honestly to the nation.CHAPTER L.“This Loller here wol precilen us somewhat.”\n“Nay by my father’s soule! that schal he nat,”\nSayde the Schipman, ‘here schal he not preche,\nWe schal no gospel glosen here ne teche.\nWe leven all in the gret God,’ quod he.\nHe wolden sowen some diffcultee.”—_Canterbury Tales_.Dorothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before she had\nasked any dangerous questions. Every morning now she sat with Celia in\nthe prettiest of up-stairs sitting-rooms, opening into a small\nconservatory—Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of mixed\nviolets, watching the remarkable acts of the baby, which were so\ndubious to her inexperienced mind that all conversation was interrupted\nby appeals for their interpretation made to the oracular nurse.\nDorothea sat by in her widow’s dress, with an expression which rather\nprovoked Celia, as being much too sad; for not only was baby quite\nwell, but really when a husband had been so dull and troublesome while\nhe lived, and besides that had—well, well! Sir James, of course, had\ntold Celia everything, with a strong representation how important it\nwas that Dorothea should not know it sooner than was inevitable.But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not\nlong remain passive where action had been assigned to her; she knew the\npurport of her husband’s will made at the time of their marriage, and\nher mind, as soon as she was clearly conscious of her position, was\nsilently occupied with what she ought to do as the owner of Lowick\nManor with the patronage of the living attached to it.One morning when her uncle paid his usual visit, though with an unusual\nalacrity in his manner which he accounted for by saying that it was now\npretty certain Parliament would be dissolved forthwith, Dorothea said—"

After Mr. Tucker had been provided for, I never heard\nmy husband say that he had any clergyman in his mind as a successor to\nhimself. I think I ought to have the keys now and go to Lowick to\nexamine all my husband’s papers. There may be something that would\nthrow light on his wishes.”“No hurry, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, quietly. “By-and-by, you know,\nyou can go, if you like. But I cast my eyes over things in the desks\nand drawers—there was nothing—nothing but deep subjects, you\nknow—besides the will. Everything can be done by-and-by. As to the\nliving, I have had an application for interest already—I should say\nrather good. Mr. Tyke has been strongly recommended to me—I had\nsomething to do with getting him an appointment before. An apostolic\nman, I believe—the sort of thing that would suit you, my dear.”“I should like to have fuller knowledge about him, uncle, and judge for\nmyself, if Mr. Casaubon has not left any expression of his wishes. He\nhas perhaps made some addition to his will—there may be some\ninstructions for me,” said Dorothea, who had all the while had this\nconjecture in her mind with relation to her husband’s work.“Nothing about the rectory, my dear—nothing,” said Mr. Brooke, rising\nto go away, and putting out his hand to his nieces: “nor about his\nresearches, you know. Nothing in the will.”Dorothea’s lip quivered.“Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear. By-and-by, you\nknow.”“I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert myself.”“Well, well, we shall see. But I must run away now—I have no end of\nwork now—it’s a crisis—a political crisis, you know. And here is Celia\nand her little man—you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a sort of\ngrandfather,” said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious to get away\nand tell Chettam that it would not be his (Mr. Brooke’s) fault if\nDorothea insisted on looking into everything.Dorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the room, and\ncast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands.“Look, Dodo! look at him! Did you ever see anything like that?” said\nCelia, in her comfortable staccato.“What, Kitty?” said Dorothea, lifting her eyes rather absently."

Do look at him.”A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down\nDorothea’s cheek as she looked up and tried to smile.“Don’t be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I am\nsure you did everything, and a great deal too much. You should be happy\nnow.”“I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look over\neverything—to see if there were any words written for me.”“You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he has not\nsaid so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the\ngallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual,\nDodo—I can see that: it vexes me.”“Where am I wrong, Kitty?” said Dorothea, quite meekly. She was almost\nready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering\nwith some fear what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her advantage, and\nwas determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as well as she did, or\nknew how to manage her. Since Celia’s baby was born, she had had a new\nsense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed clear that\nwhere there was a baby, things were right enough, and that error, in\ngeneral, was a mere lack of that central poising force.“I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,” said\nCelia. “You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable\nfor you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had\nnot been uncomfortable enough before. And he doesn’t deserve it, and\nyou will find that out. He has behaved very badly. James is as angry\nwith him as can be. And I had better tell you, to prepare you.”“Celia,” said Dorothea, entreatingly, “you distress me. Tell me at once\nwhat you mean.” It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon had left\nthe property away from her—which would not be so very distressing.“Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was all to\ngo away from you if you married—I mean—”“That is of no consequence,” said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously."

But Celia was\nadministering what she thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking\nup notions that had done Dodo’s health so much harm. So she went on in\nher neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on baby’s robes.“James says so. He says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman. And\nthere never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon\nwanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr.\nLadislaw—which is ridiculous. Only James says it was to hinder Mr.\nLadislaw from wanting to marry you for your money—just as if he ever\nwould think of making you an offer. Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as\nwell marry an Italian with white mice! But I must just go and look at\nbaby,” Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light\nshawl over her, and tripping away."

  "content": "Dorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw herself back\nhelplessly in her chair. She might have compared her experience at that\nmoment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on\na new form, that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory\nwould not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs. Everything was\nchanging its aspect: her husband’s conduct, her own duteous feeling\ntowards him, every struggle between them—and yet more, her whole\nrelation to Will Ladislaw. Her world was in a state of convulsive\nchange; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself was, that\nshe must wait and think anew. One change terrified her as if it had\nbeen a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed\nhusband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she\nsaid and did. Then again she was conscious of another change which also\nmade her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards\nWill Ladislaw. It had never before entered her mind that he could,\nunder any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the effect of the\nsudden revelation that another had thought of him in that light—that\nperhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and this\nwith the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and\nquestions not soon to be solved.It seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she heard Celia\nsaying, “That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now. You can\ngo to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room. What I think,\nDodo,” Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea was\nleaning back in her chair, and likely to be passive, “is that Mr.\nCasaubon was spiteful. I never did like him, and James never did. I\nthink the corners of his mouth were dreadfully spiteful. And now he has\nbehaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to make\nyourself uncomfortable about him. If he has been taken away, that is a\nmercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should we,\nbaby?” said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise\nof the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to\nthe nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to\nmake—you didn’t know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western form.At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he\nsaid was, “I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have\nyou been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.” Dorothea’s hand was of\na marble coldness.“She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,” said Celia. “She\nought not, ought she?”Lydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he said, looking at\nDorothea. “I hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what\nwould give her the most repose of mind. That repose will not always\ncome from being forbidden to act.”"

  "content": "“Thank you,” said Dorothea, exerting herself, “I am sure that is wise.\nThere are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why should I sit\nhere idle?” Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with\nher agitation, she added, abruptly, “You know every one in Middlemarch,\nI think, Mr. Lydgate. I shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have\nserious things to do now. I have a living to give away. You know Mr.\nTyke and all the—” But Dorothea’s effort was too much for her; she\nbroke off and burst into sobs.Lydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.“Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,” he said to Sir James, whom he\nasked to see before quitting the house. “She wants perfect freedom, I\nthink, more than any other prescription.”His attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had enabled him\nto form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life. He\nfelt sure that she had been suffering from the strain and conflict of\nself-repression; and that she was likely now to feel herself only in\nanother sort of pinfold than that from which she had been released.Lydgate’s advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he\nfound that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about\nthe will. There was no help for it now—no reason for any further delay\nin the execution of necessary business. And the next day Sir James\ncomplied at once with her request that he would drive her to Lowick.“I have no wish to stay there at present,” said Dorothea; “I could\nhardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be\nable to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at\nit from a distance. And I should like to be at the Grange a little\nwhile with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the\npeople in the village.”"

Your uncle is having political company, and you are\nbetter out of the way of such doings,” said Sir James, who at that\nmoment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw’s.\nBut no word passed between him and Dorothea about the objectionable\npart of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the mention of it\nbetween them would be impossible. Sir James was shy, even with men,\nabout disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have\nchosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to\nher at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her\nhusband’s injustice. Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what\nhad passed between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw’s moral\nclaim on the property: it would then, she thought, be apparent to him\nas it was to her, that her husband’s strange indelicate proviso had\nbeen chiefly urged by his bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and\nnot merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it\nmust be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will’s\nsake, since her friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of\nMr. Casaubon’s charity. Why should he be compared with an Italian\ncarrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed like\na mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger.At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her husband’s\nplaces of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed\nespecially to her, except that “Synoptical Tabulation,” which was\nprobably only the beginning of many intended directions for her\nguidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all\nelse, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan\nof transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it, by the sense\nof moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea’s\ncompetence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust\nof any other redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for\nhimself out of Dorothea’s nature: she could do what she resolved to do:\nand he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to\nerect a tomb with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the\nfuture volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But\nthe months gained on him and left his plans belated: he had only had\ntime to ask for that promise by which he sought to keep his cold grasp\non Dorothea’s life."

  "content": "The grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of\nher pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her\njudgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of\nfaithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her judgment, instead of\nbeing controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the\nimbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the\nhidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man\nwas no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only the\nretrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been\nlower than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had\neven blinded his scrupulous care for his own character, and made him\ndefeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the\nproperty which was the sign of that broken tie, she would have been\nglad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune\nwhich had been settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to\nownership, which she ought not to flinch from. About this property many\ntroublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in\nthinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it\nnot impossible now for her to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had\ntaken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation\nagainst him in her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of\nhis purpose revolted her.After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she\nlocked up again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal words for\nher—empty of any sign that in her husband’s lonely brooding his heart\nhad gone out to her in excuse or explanation; and she went back to\nFreshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last\ninjurious assertion of his power, the silence was unbroken.Dorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties, and\none of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her\nof. Lydgate’s ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, and as\nsoon as he could, he reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of\nmaking amends for the casting-vote he had once given with an\nill-satisfied conscience. “Instead of telling you anything about Mr.\nTyke,” he said, “I should like to speak of another man—Mr. Farebrother,\nthe Vicar of St. Botolph’s. His living is a poor one, and gives him a\nstinted provision for himself and his family. His mother, aunt, and\nsister all live with him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never\nmarried because of them. I never heard such good preaching as his—such\nplain, easy eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul’s Cross\nafter old Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects:\noriginal, simple, clear. I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to\nhave done more than he has done.”“Why has he not done more?” said Dorothea, interested now in all who\nhad slipped below their own intention."

  "content": "“That’s a hard question,” said Lydgate. “I find myself that it’s\nuncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many\nstrings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that he has got into\nthe wrong profession; he wants a wider range than that of a poor\nclergyman, and I suppose he has no interest to help him on. He is very\nfond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he is\nhampered in reconciling these tastes with his position. He has no money\nto spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him into\ncard-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does play for\nmoney, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him into company a\nlittle beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet,\nwith all that, looking at him as a whole, I think he is one of the most\nblameless men I ever knew. He has neither venom nor doubleness in him,\nand those often go with a more correct outside.”“I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that habit,”\nsaid Dorothea; “I wonder whether he wishes he could leave it off.”“I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted into\nplenty: he would be glad of the time for other things.”“My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,” said\nDorothea, meditatively. She was wishing it were possible to restore the\ntimes of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a\nstrong desire to rescue him from his chance-gotten money.“I don’t pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said Lydgate.\n“His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a\nparson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.\nPractically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an\nimpatience of everything in which the parson doesn’t cut the principal\nfigure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good\ndeal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people\nuncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!—he\nought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the\nbirds.”“True,” said Dorothea. “It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our\nfarmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into\na volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at\nLowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the\nApocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which\nChristianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a\nwider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest—I mean\nthat which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most\npeople as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than\nto condemn too much. But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear\nhim preach.”"

And that money-winning\nbusiness is really a blot. You don’t, of course, see many Middlemarch\npeople: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a\ngreat friend of Mr. Farebrother’s old ladies, and would be glad to sing\nthe Vicar’s praises. One of the old ladies—Miss Noble, the aunt—is a\nwonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw\ngallants her about sometimes. I met them one day in a back street: you\nknow Ladislaw’s look—a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this\nlittle old maid reaching up to his arm—they looked like a couple\ndropped out of a romantic comedy. But the best evidence about\nFarebrother is to see him and hear him.”Happily Dorothea was in her private sitting-room when this conversation\noccurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate’s innocent\nintroduction of Ladislaw painful to her. As was usual with him in\nmatters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond’s\nremark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon. At that moment he\nwas only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and he\nhad purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the\nVicar, in order to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr.\nCasaubon’s death he had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he had heard no rumor\nto warn him that Mr. Brooke’s confidential secretary was a dangerous\nsubject with Mrs. Casaubon. When he was gone, his picture of Ladislaw\nlingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of the\nLowick living. What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her? Would he hear\nof that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do? And\nhow would he feel when he heard it?—But she could see as well as\npossible how he smiled down at the little old maid. An Italian with\nwhite mice!—on the contrary, he was a creature who entered into every\none’s feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of\nurging his own with iron resistance.CHAPTER LI.Party is Nature too, and you shall see\nBy force of Logic how they both agree:\nThe Many in the One, the One in Many;\nAll is not Some, nor Some the same as Any:\nGenus holds species, both are great or small;\nOne genus highest, one not high at all;\nEach species has its differentia too,\nThis is not That, and He was never You,\nThough this and that are AYES, and you and he\nAre like as one to one, or three to three."

  "content": "No gossip about Mr. Casaubon’s will had yet reached Ladislaw: the air\nseemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and the coming\nelection, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter\nof itinerant shows; and more private noises were taken little notice\nof. The famous “dry election” was at hand, in which the depths of\npublic feeling might be measured by the low flood-mark of drink. Will\nLadislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea’s\nwidowhood was continually in his thought, he was so far from wishing to\nbe spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him out to tell\nhim what had passed about the Lowick living, he answered rather\nwaspishly—“Why should you bring me into the matter? I never see Mrs. Casaubon,\nand am not likely to see her, since she is at Freshitt. I never go\nthere. It is Tory ground, where I and the ‘Pioneer’ are no more welcome\nthan a poacher and his gun.”The fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by observing\nthat Mr. Brooke, instead of wishing him, as before, to come to the\nGrange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself, seemed now to\ncontrive that he should go there as little as possible. This was a\nshuffling concession of Mr. Brooke’s to Sir James Chettam’s indignant\nremonstrance; and Will, awake to the slightest hint in this direction,\nconcluded that he was to be kept away from the Grange on Dorothea’s\naccount. Her friends, then, regarded him with some suspicion? Their\nfears were quite superfluous: they were very much mistaken if they\nimagined that he would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying\nto win the favor of a rich woman.Until now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself and\nDorothea—until now that he was come to the brink of it, and saw her on\nthe other side. He began, not without some inward rage, to think of\ngoing away from the neighborhood: it would be impossible for him to\nshow any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to\ndisagreeable imputations—perhaps even in her mind, which others might\ntry to poison."

  "content": "“We are forever divided,” said Will. “I might as well be at Rome; she\nwould be no farther from me.” But what we call our despair is often\nonly the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There were plenty of reasons\nwhy he should not go—public reasons why he should not quit his post at\nthis crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed “coaching”\nfor the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and\nindirect, to be carried on. Will could not like to leave his own\nchessmen in the heat of a game; and any candidate on the right side,\neven if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a\ngentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority. To coach Mr. Brooke\nand keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote\nfor the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his independence\nand power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task. Mr.\nFarebrother’s prophecy of a fourth candidate “in the bag” had not yet\nbeen fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any\nother power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy\nnodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate\nlike Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his own expense; and the\nfight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member, Bagster the\nnew Whig member returned at the last election, and Brooke the future\nindependent member, who was to fetter himself for this occasion only.\nMr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of\nPinkerton, and Mr. Brooke’s success must depend either on plumpers\nwhich would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory\nvotes into reforming votes. The latter means, of course, would be\npreferable.This prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to Mr.\nBrooke: his impression that waverers were likely to be allured by\nwavering statements, and also the liability of his mind to stick afresh\nat opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory, gave Will\nLadislaw much trouble.“You know there are tactics in these things,” said Mr. Brooke; “meeting\npeople half-way—tempering your ideas—saying, ‘Well now, there’s\nsomething in that,’ and so on. I agree with you that this is a peculiar\noccasion—the country with a will of its own—political unions—that sort\nof thing—but we sometimes cut with rather too sharp a knife, Ladislaw.\nThese ten-pound householders, now: why ten? Draw the line\nsomewhere—yes: but why just at ten? That’s a difficult question, now,\nif you go into it.”“Of course it is,” said Will, impatiently. “But if you are to wait till\nwe get a logical Bill, you must put yourself forward as a\nrevolutionist, and then Middlemarch would not elect you, I fancy. As\nfor trimming, this is not a time for trimming.”"

  "content": "Mr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, who still appeared\nto him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; but after an interval\nthe wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself, and he was again drawn\ninto using them with much hopefulness. At this stage of affairs he was\nin excellent spirits, which even supported him under large advances of\nmoney; for his powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been\ntested by anything more difficult than a chairman’s speech introducing\nother orators, or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter, from which he\ncame away with a sense that he was a tactician by nature, and that it\nwas a pity he had not gone earlier into this kind of thing. He was a\nlittle conscious of defeat, however, with Mr. Mawmsey, a chief\nrepresentative in Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail\ntrader, and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the\nborough—willing for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas and\nsugars to reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree impartially\nwith both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this necessity of\nelecting members was a great burthen to a town; for even if there were\nno danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand, there would\nbe the painful necessity at last of disappointing respectable people\nwhose names were on his books. He was accustomed to receive large\norders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were many of\nPinkerton’s committee whose opinions had a great weight of grocery on\ntheir side. Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke, as not too “clever in\nhis intellects,” was the more likely to forgive a grocer who gave a\nhostile vote under pressure, had become confidential in his back\nparlor.“As to Reform, sir, put it in a family light,” he said, rattling the\nsmall silver in his pocket, and smiling affably. “Will it support Mrs.\nMawmsey, and enable her to bring up six children when I am no more? I\nput the question _fictiously_, knowing what must be the answer. Very\nwell, sir. I ask you what, as a husband and a father, I am to do when\ngentlemen come to me and say, ‘Do as you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote\nagainst us, I shall get my groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor\nI like to feel that I am benefiting the country by maintaining\ntradesmen of the right color.’ Those very words have been spoken to me,\nsir, in the very chair where you are now sitting. I don’t mean by your\nhonorable self, Mr. Brooke.”“No, no, no—that’s narrow, you know. Until my butler complains to me of\nyour goods, Mr. Mawmsey,” said Mr. Brooke, soothingly, “until I hear\nthat you send bad sugars, spices—that sort of thing—I shall never order\nhim to go elsewhere.”“Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,” said Mr. Mawmsey,\nfeeling that politics were clearing up a little. “There would be some\npleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that honorable\nmanner.”“Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing to put\nyourself on our side. This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by—a\nthoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come\nfirst before the rest can follow. I quite agree with you that you’ve\ngot to look at the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now.\nWe’re all one family, you know—it’s all one cupboard. Such a thing as a\nvote, now: why, it may help to make men’s fortunes at the Cape—there’s\nno knowing what may be the effect of a vote,” Mr. Brooke ended, with a\nsense of being a little out at sea, though finding it still enjoyable.\nBut Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check."

  "content": "“I beg your pardon, sir, but I can’t afford that. When I give a vote I\nmust know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the effects on\nmy till and ledger, speaking respectfully. Prices, I’ll admit, are what\nnobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls after you’ve bought\nin currants, which are a goods that will not keep—I’ve never; myself\nseen into the ins and outs there; which is a rebuke to human pride. But\nas to one family, there’s debtor and creditor, I hope; they’re not\ngoing to reform that away; else I should vote for things staying as\nthey are. Few men have less need to cry for change than I have,\npersonally speaking—that is, for self and family. I am not one of those\nwho have nothing to lose: I mean as to respectability both in parish\nand private business, and noways in respect of your honorable self and\ncustom, which you was good enough to say you would not withdraw from\nme, vote or no vote, while the article sent in was satisfactory.”After this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his wife\nthat he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and that he\ndidn’t mind so much now about going to the poll.Mr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his tactics to\nLadislaw, who for his part was glad enough to persuade himself that he\nhad no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative\nsort, and that he worked no meaner engine than knowledge. Mr. Brooke,\nnecessarily, had his agents, who understood the nature of the\nMiddlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his ignorance on the side\nof the Bill—which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it\non the side against the Bill. Will stopped his ears. Occasionally\nParliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel,\ncould hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes.\nThere were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty\nbusiness; and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr.\nBrooke through would be quite innocent.But whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to the\nmajority on the right side was very doubtful to him. He had written out\nvarious speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had begun to\nperceive that Mr. Brooke’s mind, if it had the burthen of remembering\nany train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and\nnot easily come back again. To collect documents is one mode of serving\nyour country, and to remember the contents of a document is another.\nNo! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into thinking of\nthe right arguments at the right time was to be well plied with them\ntill they took up all the room in his brain. But here there was the\ndifficulty of finding room, so many things having been taken in\nbeforehand. Mr. Brooke himself observed that his ideas stood rather in\nhis way when he was speaking."

  "content": "However, Ladislaw’s coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for\nbefore the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the\nworthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart,\nwhich looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place,\ncommanding a large area in front and two converging streets. It was a\nfine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some\nprospect of an understanding between Bagster’s committee and Brooke’s,\nto which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such\nmanufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which\nalmost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for\nPinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr. Brooke, conscious of having weakened\nthe blasts of the “Trumpet” against him, by his reforms as a landlord\nin the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove\ninto the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored\nwaistcoat. But with regard to critical occasions, it often happens that\nall moments seem comfortably remote until the last.“This looks well, eh?” said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered. “I shall\nhave a good audience, at any rate. I like this, now—this kind of public\nmade up of one’s own neighbors, you know.”The weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had never\nthought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more attached to him\nthan if he had been sent in a box from London. But they listened\nwithout much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate,\none of them—a political personage from Brassing, who came to tell\nMiddlemarch its duty—spoke so fully, that it was alarming to think what\nthe candidate could find to say after him. Meanwhile the crowd became\ndenser, and as the political personage neared the end of his speech,\nMr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he still\nhandled his eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and exchanged\nremarks with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of summons was\nindifferent.“I’ll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,” he said, with an easy\nair, to Will, who was close behind him, and presently handed him the\nsupposed fortifier. It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an abstemious\nman, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval\nfrom the first was a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his\nenergies instead of collecting them. Pray pity him: so many English\ngentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on entirely private\ngrounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his country by standing for\nParliament—which, indeed, may also be done on private grounds, but\nbeing once undertaken does absolutely demand some speechifying."

  "content": "It was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was at all\nanxious; this, he felt sure, would be all right; he should have it\nquite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope. Embarking\nwould be easy, but the vision of open sea that might come after was\nalarming. “And questions, now,” hinted the demon just waking up in his\nstomach, “somebody may put questions about the schedules.—Ladislaw,” he\ncontinued, aloud, “just hand me the memorandum of the schedules.”When Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers were quite\nloud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans, brayings, and other\nexpressions of adverse theory, which were so moderate that Mr. Standish\n(decidedly an old bird) observed in the ear next to him, “This looks\ndangerous, by God! Hawley has got some deeper plan than this.” Still,\nthe cheers were exhilarating, and no candidate could look more amiable\nthan Mr. Brooke, with the memorandum in his breast-pocket, his left\nhand on the rail of the balcony, and his right trifling with his\neye-glass. The striking points in his appearance were his buff\nwaistcoat, short-clipped blond hair, and neutral physiognomy. He began\nwith some confidence.“Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!”This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed\nnatural.“I’m uncommonly glad to be here—I was never so proud and happy in my\nlife—never so happy, you know.”This was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right thing; for,\nunhappily, the pat opening had slipped away—even couplets from Pope may\nbe but “fallings from us, vanishings,” when fear clutches us, and a\nglass of sherry is hurrying like smoke among our ideas. Ladislaw, who\nstood at the window behind the speaker, thought, “it’s all up now. The\nonly chance is that, since the best thing won’t always do, floundering\nmay answer for once.” Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews,\nfell back on himself and his qualifications—always an appropriate\ngraceful subject for a candidate."

  "content": "“I am a close neighbor of yours, my good friends—you’ve known me on the\nbench a good while—I’ve always gone a good deal into public\nquestions—machinery, now, and machine-breaking—you’re many of you\nconcerned with machinery, and I’ve been going into that lately. It\nwon’t do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on—trade,\nmanufactures, commerce, interchange of staples—that kind of thing—since\nAdam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the\nglobe:—‘Observation with extensive view,’ must look everywhere, ‘from\nChina to Peru,’ as somebody says—Johnson, I think, ‘The Rambler,’ you\nknow. That is what I have done up to a certain point—not as far as\nPeru; but I’ve not always stayed at home—I saw it wouldn’t do. I’ve\nbeen in the Levant, where some of your Middlemarch goods go—and then,\nagain, in the Baltic. The Baltic, now.”Plying among his recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might have got\nalong, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest\nseas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the\nenemy. At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders\nof the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him,\nthe effigy of himself: buff-colored waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral\nphysiognomy, painted on rag; and there had arisen, apparently in the\nair, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of\nhis words. Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at the\nopposite angles of the converging streets; but they were either blank,\nor filled by laughing listeners. The most innocent echo has an impish\nmockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and this\necho was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the precision\nof a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook. By\nthe time it said, “The Baltic, now,” the laugh which had been running\nthrough the audience became a general shout, and but for the sobering\neffects of party and that great public cause which the entanglement of\nthings had identified with “Brooke of Tipton,” the laugh might have\ncaught his committee. Mr. Bulstrode asked, reprehensively, what the new\npolice was doing; but a voice could not well be collared, and an attack\non the effigy of the candidate would have been too equivocal, since\nHawley probably meant it to be pelted."

  "content": "Mr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious of\nanything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself: he had\neven a little singing in the ears, and he was the only person who had\nnot yet taken distinct account of the echo or discerned the image of\nhimself. Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than\nanxiety about what we have got to say. Mr. Brooke heard the laughter;\nbut he had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance, and he was at\nthis moment additionally excited by the tickling, stinging sense that\nhis lost exordium was coming back to fetch him from the Baltic.“That reminds me,” he went on, thrusting a hand into his side-pocket,\nwith an easy air, “if I wanted a precedent, you know—but we never want\na precedent for the right thing—but there is Chatham, now; I can’t say\nI should have supported Chatham, or Pitt, the younger Pitt—he was not a\nman of ideas, and we want ideas, you know.”“Blast your ideas! we want the Bill,” said a loud rough voice from the\ncrowd below.Immediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke,\nrepeated, “Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.” The laugh was louder\nthan ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent,\nheard distinctly the mocking echo. But it seemed to ridicule his\ninterrupter, and in that light was encouraging; so he replied with\namenity—“There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do we\nmeet for but to speak our minds—freedom of opinion, freedom of the\npress, liberty—that kind of thing? The Bill, now—you shall have the\nBill”—here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his eye-glass and take\nthe paper from his breast-pocket, with a sense of being practical and\ncoming to particulars. The invisible Punch followed:—“You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering contest, and a\nseat outside Parliament as delivered, five thousand pounds, seven\nshillings, and fourpence.”Mr. Brooke, amid the roars of laughter, turned red, let his eye-glass\nfall, and looking about him confusedly, saw the image of himself, which\nhad come nearer. The next moment he saw it dolorously bespattered with\neggs. His spirit rose a little, and his voice too."
