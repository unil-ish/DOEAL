  "content": "That evening Lydgate was a little comforted by observing that Rosamond\nwas more lively than she had usually been of late, and even seemed\ninterested in doing what would please him without being asked. He\nthought, “If she will be happy and I can rub through, what does it all\nsignify? It is only a narrow swamp that we have to pass in a long\njourney. If I can get my mind clear again, I shall do.”He was so much cheered that he began to search for an account of\nexperiments which he had long ago meant to look up, and had neglected\nout of that creeping self-despair which comes in the train of petty\nanxieties. He felt again some of the old delightful absorption in a\nfar-reaching inquiry, while Rosamond played the quiet music which was\nas helpful to his meditation as the plash of an oar on the evening\nlake. It was rather late; he had pushed away all the books, and was\nlooking at the fire with his hands clasped behind his head in\nforgetfulness of everything except the construction of a new\ncontrolling experiment, when Rosamond, who had left the piano and was\nleaning back in her chair watching him, said—“Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house already.”Lydgate, startled and jarred, looked up in silence for a moment, like a\nman who has been disturbed in his sleep. Then flushing with an\nunpleasant consciousness, he asked—“How do you know?”“I called at Mrs. Plymdale’s this morning, and she told me that he had\ntaken the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s.”Lydgate was silent. He drew his hands from behind his head and pressed\nthem against the hair which was hanging, as it was apt to do, in a mass\non his forehead, while he rested his elbows on his knees. He was\nfeeling bitter disappointment, as if he had opened a door out of a\nsuffocating place and had found it walled up; but he also felt sure\nthat Rosamond was pleased with the cause of his disappointment. He\npreferred not looking at her and not speaking, until he had got over\nthe first spasm of vexation. After all, he said in his bitterness, what\ncan a woman care about so much as house and furniture? a husband\nwithout them is an absurdity. When he looked up and pushed his hair\naside, his dark eyes had a miserable blank non-expectance of sympathy\nin them, but he only said, coolly—“Perhaps some one else may turn up. I told Trumbull to be on the\nlook-out if he failed with Plymdale.”"

She trusted to the chance that nothing more\nwould pass between her husband and the auctioneer until some issue\nshould have justified her interference; at any rate, she had hindered\nthe event which she immediately dreaded. After a pause, she said—“How much money is it that those disagreeable people want?”“What disagreeable people?”“Those who took the list—and the others. I mean, how much money would\nsatisfy them so that you need not be troubled any more?”Lydgate surveyed her for a moment, as if he were looking for symptoms,\nand then said, “Oh, if I could have got six hundred from Plymdale for\nfurniture and as premium, I might have managed. I could have paid off\nDover, and given enough on account to the others to make them wait\npatiently, if we contracted our expenses.”“But I mean how much should you want if we stayed in this house?”“More than I am likely to get anywhere,” said Lydgate, with rather a\ngrating sarcasm in his tone. It angered him to perceive that Rosamond’s\nmind was wandering over impracticable wishes instead of facing possible\nefforts.“Why should you not mention the sum?” said Rosamond, with a mild\nindication that she did not like his manners.“Well,” said Lydgate in a guessing tone, “it would take at least a\nthousand to set me at ease. But,” he added, incisively, “I have to\nconsider what I shall do without it, not with it.”Rosamond said no more."

  "content": "But the next day she carried out her plan of writing to Sir Godwin\nLydgate. Since the Captain’s visit, she had received a letter from him,\nand also one from Mrs. Mengan, his married sister, condoling with her\non the loss of her baby, and expressing vaguely the hope that they\nshould see her again at Quallingham. Lydgate had told her that this\npoliteness meant nothing; but she was secretly convinced that any\nbackwardness in Lydgate’s family towards him was due to his cold and\ncontemptuous behavior, and she had answered the letters in her most\ncharming manner, feeling some confidence that a specific invitation\nwould follow. But there had been total silence. The Captain evidently\nwas not a great penman, and Rosamond reflected that the sisters might\nhave been abroad. However, the season was come for thinking of friends\nat home, and at any rate Sir Godwin, who had chucked her under the\nchin, and pronounced her to be like the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Croly,\nwho had made a conquest of him in 1790, would be touched by any appeal\nfrom her, and would find it pleasant for her sake to behave as he ought\nto do towards his nephew. Rosamond was naively convinced of what an old\ngentleman ought to do to prevent her from suffering annoyance. And she\nwrote what she considered the most judicious letter possible—one which\nwould strike Sir Godwin as a proof of her excellent sense—pointing out\nhow desirable it was that Tertius should quit such a place as\nMiddlemarch for one more fitted to his talents, how the unpleasant\ncharacter of the inhabitants had hindered his professional success, and\nhow in consequence he was in money difficulties, from which it would\nrequire a thousand pounds thoroughly to extricate him. She did not say\nthat Tertius was unaware of her intention to write; for she had the\nidea that his supposed sanction of her letter would be in accordance\nwith what she did say of his great regard for his uncle Godwin as the\nrelative who had always been his best friend. Such was the force of\nPoor Rosamond’s tactics now she applied them to affairs."

  "content": "This had happened before the party on New Year’s Day, and no answer had\nyet come from Sir Godwin. But on the morning of that day Lydgate had to\nlearn that Rosamond had revoked his order to Borthrop Trumbull. Feeling\nit necessary that she should be gradually accustomed to the idea of\ntheir quitting the house in Lowick Gate, he overcame his reluctance to\nspeak to her again on the subject, and when they were breakfasting\nsaid—“I shall try to see Trumbull this morning, and tell him to advertise\nthe house in the ‘Pioneer’ and the ‘Trumpet.’ If the thing were\nadvertised, some one might be inclined to take it who would not\notherwise have thought of a change. In these country places many people\ngo on in their old houses when their families are too large for them,\nfor want of knowing where they can find another. And Trumbull seems to\nhave got no bite at all.”Rosamond knew that the inevitable moment was come. “I ordered Trumbull\nnot to inquire further,” she said, with a careful calmness which was\nevidently defensive.Lydgate stared at her in mute amazement. Only half an hour before he\nhad been fastening up her plaits for her, and talking the “little\nlanguage” of affection, which Rosamond, though not returning it,\naccepted as if she had been a serene and lovely image, now and then\nmiraculously dimpling towards her votary. With such fibres still astir\nin him, the shock he received could not at once be distinctly anger; it\nwas confused pain. He laid down the knife and fork with which he was\ncarving, and throwing himself back in his chair, said at last, with a\ncool irony in his tone—“May I ask when and why you did so?”“When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house, I called to tell him\nnot to mention ours to them; and at the same time I told him not to let\nthe affair go on any further. I knew that it would be very injurious to\nyou if it were known that you wished to part with your house and\nfurniture, and I had a very strong objection to it. I think that was\nreason enough.”"

  "content": "“It was of no consequence then that I had told you imperative reasons\nof another kind; of no consequence that I had come to a different\nconclusion, and given an order accordingly?” said Lydgate, bitingly,\nthe thunder and lightning gathering about his brow and eyes.The effect of any one’s anger on Rosamond had always been to make her\nshrink in cold dislike, and to become all the more calmly correct, in\nthe conviction that she was not the person to misbehave whatever others\nmight do. She replied—“I think I had a perfect right to speak on a subject which concerns me\nat least as much as you.”“Clearly—you had a right to speak, but only to me. You had no right to\ncontradict my orders secretly, and treat me as if I were a fool,” said\nLydgate, in the same tone as before. Then with some added scorn, “Is it\npossible to make you understand what the consequences will be? Is it of\nany use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the\nhouse?”“It is not necessary for you to tell me again,” said Rosamond, in a\nvoice that fell and trickled like cold water-drops. “I remembered what\nyou said. You spoke just as violently as you do now. But that does not\nalter my opinion that you ought to try every other means rather than\ntake a step which is so painful to me. And as to advertising the house,\nI think it would be perfectly degrading to you.”“And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine?”“You can do so, of course. But I think you ought to have told me before\nwe were married that you would place me in the worst position, rather\nthan give up your own will.”Lydgate did not speak, but tossed his head on one side, and twitched\nthe corners of his mouth in despair. Rosamond, seeing that he was not\nlooking at her, rose and set his cup of coffee before him; but he took\nno notice of it, and went on with an inward drama and argument,\noccasionally moving in his seat, resting one arm on the table, and\nrubbing his hand against his hair. There was a conflux of emotions and\nthoughts in him that would not let him either give thorough way to his\nanger or persevere with simple rigidity of resolve. Rosamond took\nadvantage of his silence."

I\ncould not have imagined then that you would want to sell our furniture,\nand take a house in Bride Street, where the rooms are like cages. If we\nare to live in that way let us at least leave Middlemarch.”“These would be very strong considerations,” said Lydgate, half\nironically—still there was a withered paleness about his lips as he\nlooked at his coffee, and did not drink—“these would be very strong\nconsiderations if I did not happen to be in debt.”“Many persons must have been in debt in the same way, but if they are\nrespectable, people trust them. I am sure I have heard papa say that\nthe Torbits were in debt, and they went on very well. It cannot be good\nto act rashly,” said Rosamond, with serene wisdom.Lydgate sat paralyzed by opposing impulses: since no reasoning he could\napply to Rosamond seemed likely to conquer her assent, he wanted to\nsmash and grind some object on which he could at least produce an\nimpression, or else to tell her brutally that he was master, and she\nmust obey. But he not only dreaded the effect of such extremities on\ntheir mutual life—he had a growing dread of Rosamond’s quiet elusive\nobstinacy, which would not allow any assertion of power to be final;\nand again, she had touched him in a spot of keenest feeling by implying\nthat she had been deluded with a false vision of happiness in marrying\nhim. As to saying that he was master, it was not the fact. The very\nresolution to which he had wrought himself by dint of logic and\nhonorable pride was beginning to relax under her torpedo contact. He\nswallowed half his cup of coffee, and then rose to go.“I may at least request that you will not go to Trumbull at\npresent—until it has been seen that there are no other means,” said\nRosamond. Although she was not subject to much fear, she felt it safer\nnot to betray that she had written to Sir Godwin. “Promise me that you\nwill not go to him for a few weeks, or without telling me.”Lydgate gave a short laugh. “I think it is I who should exact a promise\nthat you will do nothing without telling me,” he said, turning his eyes\nsharply upon her, and then moving to the door."

  "content": "“You remember that we are going to dine at papa’s,” said Rosamond,\nwishing that he should turn and make a more thorough concession to her.\nBut he only said “Oh yes,” impatiently, and went away. She held it to\nbe very odious in him that he did not think the painful propositions he\nhad had to make to her were enough, without showing so unpleasant a\ntemper. And when she put the moderate request that he would defer going\nto Trumbull again, it was cruel in him not to assure her of what he\nmeant to do. She was convinced of her having acted in every way for the\nbest; and each grating or angry speech of Lydgate’s served only as an\naddition to the register of offences in her mind. Poor Rosamond for\nmonths had begun to associate her husband with feelings of\ndisappointment, and the terribly inflexible relation of marriage had\nlost its charm of encouraging delightful dreams. It had freed her from\nthe disagreeables of her father’s house, but it had not given her\neverything that she had wished and hoped. The Lydgate with whom she had\nbeen in love had been a group of airy conditions for her, most of which\nhad disappeared, while their place had been taken by every-day details\nwhich must be lived through slowly from hour to hour, not floated\nthrough with a rapid selection of favorable aspects. The habits of\nLydgate’s profession, his home preoccupation with scientific subjects,\nwhich seemed to her almost like a morbid vampire’s taste, his peculiar\nviews of things which had never entered into the dialogue of\ncourtship—all these continually alienating influences, even without the\nfact of his having placed himself at a disadvantage in the town, and\nwithout that first shock of revelation about Dover’s debt, would have\nmade his presence dull to her. There was another presence which ever\nsince the early days of her marriage, until four months ago, had been\nan agreeable excitement, but that was gone: Rosamond would not confess\nto herself how much the consequent blank had to do with her utter\nennui; and it seemed to her (perhaps she was right) that an invitation\nto Quallingham, and an opening for Lydgate to settle elsewhere than in\nMiddlemarch—in London, or somewhere likely to be free from\nunpleasantness—would satisfy her quite well, and make her indifferent\nto the absence of Will Ladislaw, towards whom she felt some resentment\nfor his exaltation of Mrs. Casaubon."

His flushed effort\nwhile talking to Mr. Farebrother—his effort after the cynical pretence\nthat all ways of getting money are essentially the same, and that\nchance has an empire which reduces choice to a fool’s illusion—was but\nthe symptom of a wavering resolve, a benumbed response to the old\nstimuli of enthusiasm."

  "content": "What was he to do? He saw even more keenly than Rosamond did the\ndreariness of taking her into the small house in Bride Street, where\nshe would have scanty furniture around her and discontent within: a\nlife of privation and life with Rosamond were two images which had\nbecome more and more irreconcilable ever since the threat of privation\nhad disclosed itself. But even if his resolves had forced the two\nimages into combination, the useful preliminaries to that hard change\nwere not visibly within reach. And though he had not given the promise\nwhich his wife had asked for, he did not go again to Trumbull. He even\nbegan to think of taking a rapid journey to the North and seeing Sir\nGodwin. He had once believed that nothing would urge him into making an\napplication for money to his uncle, but he had not then known the full\npressure of alternatives yet more disagreeable. He could not depend on\nthe effect of a letter; it was only in an interview, however\ndisagreeable this might be to himself, that he could give a thorough\nexplanation and could test the effectiveness of kinship. No sooner had\nLydgate begun to represent this step to himself as the easiest than\nthere was a reaction of anger that he—he who had long ago determined to\nlive aloof from such abject calculations, such self-interested anxiety\nabout the inclinations and the pockets of men with whom he had been\nproud to have no aims in common—should have fallen not simply to their\nlevel, but to the level of soliciting them.CHAPTER LXV.One of us two must bowen douteless,\nAnd, sith a man is more reasonable\nThan woman is, ye [men] moste be suffrable.\n—CHAUCER: _Canterbury Tales_.The bias of human nature to be slow in correspondence triumphs even\nover the present quickening in the general pace of things: what wonder\nthen that in 1832 old Sir Godwin Lydgate was slow to write a letter\nwhich was of consequence to others rather than to himself? Nearly three\nweeks of the new year were gone, and Rosamond, awaiting an answer to\nher winning appeal, was every day disappointed. Lydgate, in total\nignorance of her expectations, was seeing the bills come in, and\nfeeling that Dover’s use of his advantage over other creditors was\nimminent. He had never mentioned to Rosamond his brooding purpose of\ngoing to Quallingham: he did not want to admit what would appear to her\na concession to her wishes after indignant refusal, until the last\nmoment; but he was really expecting to set off soon. A slice of the\nrailway would enable him to manage the whole journey and back in four\ndays.But one morning after Lydgate had gone out, a letter came addressed to\nhim, which Rosamond saw clearly to be from Sir Godwin. She was full of\nhope. Perhaps there might be a particular note to her enclosed; but\nLydgate was naturally addressed on the question of money or other aid,\nand the fact that he was written to, nay, the very delay in writing at\nall, seemed to certify that the answer was thoroughly compliant. She\nwas too much excited by these thoughts to do anything but light\nstitching in a warm corner of the dining-room, with the outside of this\nmomentous letter lying on the table before her. About twelve she heard\nher husband’s step in the passage, and tripping to open the door, she\nsaid in her lightest tones, “Tertius, come in here—here is a letter for\nyou.”"

She had expected him to be surprised.While Lydgate’s eyes glanced rapidly over the brief letter, she saw his\nface, usually of a pale brown, taking on a dry whiteness; with nostrils\nand lips quivering he tossed down the letter before her, and said\nviolently—“It will be impossible to endure life with you, if you will always be\nacting secretly—acting in opposition to me and hiding your actions.”He checked his speech and turned his back on her—then wheeled round and\nwalked about, sat down, and got up again restlessly, grasping hard the\nobjects deep down in his pockets. He was afraid of saying something\nirremediably cruel.Rosamond too had changed color as she read. The letter ran in this\nway:—“DEAR TERTIUS,—Don’t set your wife to write to me when you have\nanything to ask. It is a roundabout wheedling sort of thing which I\nshould not have credited you with. I never choose to write to a woman\non matters of business. As to my supplying you with a thousand pounds,\nor only half that sum, I can do nothing of the sort. My own family\ndrains me to the last penny. With two younger sons and three daughters,\nI am not likely to have cash to spare. You seem to have got through\nyour own money pretty quickly, and to have made a mess where you are;\nthe sooner you go somewhere else the better. But I have nothing to do\nwith men of your profession, and can’t help you there. I did the best I\ncould for you as guardian, and let you have your own way in taking to\nmedicine. You might have gone into the army or the Church. Your money\nwould have held out for that, and there would have been a surer ladder\nbefore you. Your uncle Charles has had a grudge against you for not\ngoing into his profession, but not I. I have always wished you well,\nbut you must consider yourself on your own legs entirely now.Your affectionate uncle,\nGODWIN LYDGATE.”"

  "content": "When Rosamond had finished reading the letter she sat quite still, with\nher hands folded before her, restraining any show of her keen\ndisappointment, and intrenching herself in quiet passivity under her\nhusband’s wrath. Lydgate paused in his movements, looked at her again,\nand said, with biting severity—“Will this be enough to convince you of the harm you may do by secret\nmeddling? Have you sense enough to recognize now your incompetence to\njudge and act for me—to interfere with your ignorance in affairs which\nit belongs to me to decide on?”The words were hard; but this was not the first time that Lydgate had\nbeen frustrated by her. She did not look at him, and made no reply.“I had nearly resolved on going to Quallingham. It would have cost me\npain enough to do it, yet it might have been of some use. But it has\nbeen of no use for me to think of anything. You have always been\ncounteracting me secretly. You delude me with a false assent, and then\nI am at the mercy of your devices. If you mean to resist every wish I\nexpress, say so and defy me. I shall at least know what I am doing\nthen.”It is a terrible moment in young lives when the closeness of love’s\nbond has turned to this power of galling. In spite of Rosamond’s\nself-control a tear fell silently and rolled over her lips. She still\nsaid nothing; but under that quietude was hidden an intense effect: she\nwas in such entire disgust with her husband that she wished she had\nnever seen him. Sir Godwin’s rudeness towards her and utter want of\nfeeling ranged him with Dover and all other creditors—disagreeable\npeople who only thought of themselves, and did not mind how annoying\nthey were to her. Even her father was unkind, and might have done more\nfor them. In fact there was but one person in Rosamond’s world whom she\ndid not regard as blameworthy, and that was the graceful creature with\nblond plaits and with little hands crossed before her, who had never\nexpressed herself unbecomingly, and had always acted for the best—the\nbest naturally being what she best liked."

He needed to recover the full\nsense that he was in the right by moderating his words.“Can you not see, Rosamond,” he began again, trying to be simply grave\nand not bitter, “that nothing can be so fatal as a want of openness and\nconfidence between us? It has happened again and again that I have\nexpressed a decided wish, and you have seemed to assent, yet after that\nyou have secretly disobeyed my wish. In that way I can never know what\nI have to trust to. There would be some hope for us if you would admit\nthis. Am I such an unreasonable, furious brute? Why should you not be\nopen with me?” Still silence.“Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend\non your not acting secretly in future?” said Lydgate, urgently, but\nwith something of request in his tone which Rosamond was quick to\nperceive. She spoke with coolness.“I cannot possibly make admissions or promises in answer to such words\nas you have used towards me. I have not been accustomed to language of\nthat kind. You have spoken of my ‘secret meddling,’ and my ‘interfering\nignorance,’ and my ‘false assent.’ I have never expressed myself in\nthat way to you, and I think that you ought to apologize. You spoke of\nits being impossible to live with me. Certainly you have not made my\nlife pleasant to me of late. I think it was to be expected that I\nshould try to avert some of the hardships which our marriage has\nbrought on me.” Another tear fell as Rosamond ceased speaking, and she\npressed it away as quietly as the first."

He laid down his hat,\nflung an arm over the back of his chair, and looked down for some\nmoments without speaking. Rosamond had the double purchase over him of\ninsensibility to the point of justice in his reproach, and of\nsensibility to the undeniable hardships now present in her married\nlife. Although her duplicity in the affair of the house had exceeded\nwhat he knew, and had really hindered the Plymdales from knowing of it,\nshe had no consciousness that her action could rightly be called false.\nWe are not obliged to identify our own acts according to a strict\nclassification, any more than the materials of our grocery and clothes.\nRosamond felt that she was aggrieved, and that this was what Lydgate\nhad to recognize.As for him, the need of accommodating himself to her nature, which was\ninflexible in proportion to its negations, held him as with pincers. He\nhad begun to have an alarmed foresight of her irrevocable loss of love\nfor him, and the consequent dreariness of their life. The ready fulness\nof his emotions made this dread alternate quickly with the first\nviolent movements of his anger. It would assuredly have been a vain\nboast in him to say that he was her master.“You have not made my life pleasant to me of late”—“the hardships which\nour marriage has brought on me”—these words were stinging his\nimagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream. If he were not only\nto sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous\nfettering of domestic hate?“Rosamond,” he said, turning his eyes on her with a melancholy look,\n“you should allow for a man’s words when he is disappointed and\nprovoked. You and I cannot have opposite interests. I cannot part my\nhappiness from yours. If I am angry with you, it is that you seem not\nto see how any concealment divides us. How could I wish to make\nanything hard to you either by my words or conduct? When I hurt you, I\nhurt part of my own life. I should never be angry with you if you would\nbe quite open with me.”“I have only wished to prevent you from hurrying us into wretchedness\nwithout any necessity,” said Rosamond, the tears coming again from a\nsoftened feeling now that her husband had softened. “It is so very hard\nto be disgraced here among all the people we know, and to live in such\na miserable way. I wish I had died with the baby.”"

Lydgate drew his chair near\nto hers and pressed her delicate head against his cheek with his\npowerful tender hand. He only caressed her; he did not say anything;\nfor what was there to say? He could not promise to shield her from the\ndreaded wretchedness, for he could see no sure means of doing so. When\nhe left her to go out again, he told himself that it was ten times\nharder for her than for him: he had a life away from home, and constant\nappeals to his activity on behalf of others. He wished to excuse\neverything in her if he could—but it was inevitable that in that\nexcusing mood he should think of her as if she were an animal of\nanother and feebler species. Nevertheless she had mastered him.CHAPTER LXVI.’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,\nAnother thing to fall.\n—_Measure for Measure_.Lydgate certainly had good reason to reflect on the service his\npractice did him in counteracting his personal cares.

It was not simply that beneficent harness of routine\nwhich enables silly men to live respectably and unhappy men to live\ncalmly—it was a perpetual claim on the immediate fresh application of\nthought, and on the consideration of another’s need and trial. Many of\nus looking back through life would say that the kindest man we have\never known has been a medical man, or perhaps that surgeon whose fine\ntact, directed by deeply informed perception, has come to us in our\nneed with a more sublime beneficence than that of miracle-workers. Some\nof that twice-blessed mercy was always with Lydgate in his work at the\nHospital or in private houses, serving better than any opiate to quiet\nand sustain him under his anxieties and his sense of mental degeneracy."

  "content": "Mr. Farebrother’s suspicion as to the opiate was true, however. Under\nthe first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties, and the first\nperception that his marriage, if it were not to be a yoked loneliness,\nmust be a state of effort to go on loving without too much care about\nbeing loved, he had once or twice tried a dose of opium. But he had no\nhereditary constitutional craving after such transient escapes from the\nhauntings of misery. He was strong, could drink a great deal of wine,\nbut did not care about it; and when the men round him were drinking\nspirits, he took sugar and water, having a contemptuous pity even for\nthe earliest stages of excitement from drink. It was the same with\ngambling. He had looked on at a great deal of gambling in Paris,\nwatching it as if it had been a disease. He was no more tempted by such\nwinning than he was by drink. He had said to himself that the only\nwinning he cared for must be attained by a conscious process of high,\ndifficult combination tending towards a beneficent result. The power he\nlonged for could not be represented by agitated fingers clutching a\nheap of coin, or by the half-barbarous, half-idiotic triumph in the\neyes of a man who sweeps within his arms the ventures of twenty\nchapfallen companions.But just as he had tried opium, so his thought now began to turn upon\ngambling—not with appetite for its excitement, but with a sort of\nwistful inward gaze after that easy way of getting money, which implied\nno asking and brought no responsibility. If he had been in London or\nParis at that time, it is probable that such thoughts, seconded by\nopportunity, would have taken him into a gambling-house, no longer to\nwatch the gamblers, but to watch with them in kindred eagerness.\nRepugnance would have been surmounted by the immense need to win, if\nchance would be kind enough to let him. An incident which happened not\nvery long after that airy notion of getting aid from his uncle had been\nexcluded, was a strong sign of the effect that might have followed any\nextant opportunity of gambling."

  "content": "The billiard-room at the Green Dragon was the constant resort of a\ncertain set, most of whom, like our acquaintance Mr. Bambridge, were\nregarded as men of pleasure. It was here that poor Fred Vincy had made\npart of his memorable debt, having lost money in betting, and been\nobliged to borrow of that gay companion. It was generally known in\nMiddlemarch that a good deal of money was lost and won in this way; and\nthe consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place of dissipation\nnaturally heightened in some quarters the temptation to go there.\nProbably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry,\nwished that there were something a little more tremendous to keep to\nthemselves concerning it; but they were not a closed community, and\nmany decent seniors as well as juniors occasionally turned into the\nbilliard-room to see what was going on. Lydgate, who had the muscular\naptitude for billiards, and was fond of the game, had once or twice in\nthe early days after his arrival in Middlemarch taken his turn with the\ncue at the Green Dragon; but afterwards he had no leisure for the game,\nand no inclination for the socialities there. One evening, however, he\nhad occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort. The horsedealer had\nengaged to get him a customer for his remaining good horse, for which\nLydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack, hoping by this\nreduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds; and he cared now for\nevery small sum, as a help towards feeding the patience of his\ntradesmen. To run up to the billiard-room, as he was passing, would\nsave time.Mr. Bambridge was not yet come, but would be sure to arrive by-and-by,\nsaid his friend Mr. Horrock; and Lydgate stayed, playing a game for the\nsake of passing the time. That evening he had the peculiar light in the\neyes and the unusual vivacity which had been once noticed in him by Mr.\nFarebrother. The exceptional fact of his presence was much noticed in\nthe room, where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company; and\nseveral lookers-on, as well as some of the players, were betting with\nanimation. Lydgate was playing well, and felt confident; the bets were\ndropping round him, and with a swift glancing thought of the probable\ngain which might double the sum he was saving from his horse, he began\nto bet on his own play, and won again and again. Mr. Bambridge had come\nin, but Lydgate did not notice him. He was not only excited with his\nplay, but visions were gleaming on him of going the next day to\nBrassing, where there was gambling on a grander scale to be had, and\nwhere, by one powerful snatch at the devil’s bait, he might carry it\noff without the hook, and buy his rescue from his daily solicitings.He was still winning when two new visitors entered. One of them was a\nyoung Hawley, just come from his law studies in town, and the other was\nFred Vincy, who had spent several evenings of late at this old haunt of\nhis. Young Hawley, an accomplished billiard-player, brought a cool\nfresh hand to the cue. But Fred Vincy, startled at seeing Lydgate, and\nastonished to see him betting with an excited air, stood aside, and\nkept out of the circle round the table."

  "content": "Fred had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late. He had\nbeen working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under\nMr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the\ndefects of his handwriting, this practice being, perhaps, a little the\nless severe that it was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth’s\nunder the eyes of Mary. But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at\nLowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother’s\nresidence in Middlemarch, where he was carrying out some parochial\nplans; and Fred, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned\ninto the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the\nold flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general,\nconsidered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct. He\nhad not been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of his own\nto ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his\ngig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him. It was a\nlittle too bad, Fred began to think, that he should be kept in the\ntraces with more severity than if he had been a clergyman. “I will tell\nyou what, Mistress Mary—it will be rather harder work to learn\nsurveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write sermons,”\nhe had said, wishing her to appreciate what he went through for her\nsake; “and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to me. They\nhad sport, and never learned to write a bookkeeping hand.” And now,\nMary being out of the way for a little while, Fred, like any other\nstrong dog who cannot slip his collar, had pulled up the staple of his\nchain and made a small escape, not of course meaning to go fast or far.\nThere could be no reason why he should not play at billiards, but he\nwas determined not to bet. As to money just now, Fred had in his mind\nthe heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr.\nGarth offered him, and returning it, which he could easily do by giving\nup all futile money-spending, since he had a superfluous stock of\nclothes, and no expense in his board. In that way he could, in one\nyear, go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he had\ndeprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when she needed that sum more\nthan she did now. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this\nevening, which was the fifth of his recent visits to the billiard-room,\nFred had, not in his pocket, but in his mind, the ten pounds which he\nmeant to reserve for himself from his half-year’s salary (having before\nhim the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely\nto be come home again)—he had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund\nfrom which he might risk something, if there were a chance of a good\nbet. Why? Well, when sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn’t he\ncatch a few? He would never go far along that road again; but a man\nlikes to assure himself, and men of pleasure generally, what he could\ndo in the way of mischief if he chose, and that if he abstains from\nmaking himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking with the utmost\nlooseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it is\nnot because he is a spooney. Fred did not enter into formal reasons,\nwhich are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling\nreturns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was\nlurking in him a prophetic sense that evening, that when he began to\nplay he should also begin to bet—that he should enjoy some\npunch-drinking, and in general prepare himself for feeling “rather\nseedy” in the morning. It is in such indefinable movements that action\noften begins."

Fred felt a shock greater than he could quite account\nfor by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that his\nfather had refused to help him; and his own inclination to enter into\nthe play was suddenly checked. It was a strange reversal of attitudes:\nFred’s blond face and blue eyes, usually bright and careless, ready to\ngive attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement,\nlooking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight\nof something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of\nself-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to\nlie behind his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking\nwith that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal\nwith fierce eyes and retractile claws."

  "content": "Lydgate, by betting on his own strokes, had won sixteen pounds; but\nyoung Hawley’s arrival had changed the poise of things. He made\nfirst-rate strokes himself, and began to bet against Lydgate’s strokes,\nthe strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in\nhis own movements to defying another person’s doubt in them. The\ndefiance was more exciting than the confidence, but it was less sure.\nHe continued to bet on his own play, but began often to fail. Still he\nwent on, for his mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous\ncrevice of play as if he had been the most ignorant lounger there. Fred\nobserved that Lydgate was losing fast, and found himself in the new\nsituation of puzzling his brains to think of some device by which,\nwithout being offensive, he could withdraw Lydgate’s attention, and\nperhaps suggest to him a reason for quitting the room. He saw that\nothers were observing Lydgate’s strange unlikeness to himself, and it\noccurred to him that merely to touch his elbow and call him aside for a\nmoment might rouse him from his absorption. He could think of nothing\ncleverer than the daring improbability of saying that he wanted to see\nRosy, and wished to know if she were at home this evening; and he was\ngoing desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up\nto him with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and\nbegged to speak with him.Fred was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that he\nwould be down immediately, he went with a new impulse up to Lydgate,\nsaid, “Can I speak to you a moment?” and drew him aside.“Farebrother has just sent up a message to say that he wants to speak\nto me. He is below. I thought you might like to know he was there, if\nyou had anything to say to him.”Fred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because he could\nnot say, “You are losing confoundedly, and are making everybody stare\nat you; you had better come away.” But inspiration could hardly have\nserved him better. Lydgate had not before seen that Fred was present,\nand his sudden appearance with an announcement of Mr. Farebrother had\nthe effect of a sharp concussion.“No, no,” said Lydgate; “I have nothing particular to say to him.\nBut—the game is up—I must be going—I came in just to see Bambridge.”“Bambridge is over there, but he is making a row—I don’t think he’s\nready for business. Come down with me to Farebrother. I expect he is\ngoing to blow me up, and you will shield me,” said Fred, with some\nadroitness.Lydgate felt shame, but could not bear to act as if he felt it, by\nrefusing to see Mr. Farebrother; and he went down. They merely shook\nhands, however, and spoke of the frost; and when all three had turned\ninto the street, the Vicar seemed quite willing to say good-by to\nLydgate. His present purpose was clearly to talk with Fred alone, and\nhe said, kindly, “I disturbed you, young gentleman, because I have some\npressing business with you. Walk with me to St. Botolph’s, will you?”It was a fine night, the sky thick with stars, and Mr. Farebrother\nproposed that they should make a circuit to the old church by the\nLondon road. The next thing he said was—“I thought Lydgate never went to the Green Dragon?”“So did I,” said Fred. “But he said that he went to see Bambridge.”“He was not playing, then?”"

  "content": "Fred had not meant to tell this, but he was obliged now to say, “Yes,\nhe was. But I suppose it was an accidental thing. I have never seen him\nthere before.”“You have been going often yourself, then, lately?”“Oh, about five or six times.”“I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going\nthere?”“Yes. You know all about it,” said Fred, not liking to be catechised in\nthis way. “I made a clean breast to you.”“I suppose that gives me a warrant to speak about the matter now. It is\nunderstood between us, is it not?—that we are on a footing of open\nfriendship: I have listened to you, and you will be willing to listen\nto me. I may take my turn in talking a little about myself?”“I am under the deepest obligation to you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred,\nin a state of uncomfortable surmise.“I will not affect to deny that you are under some obligation to me.\nBut I am going to confess to you, Fred, that I have been tempted to\nreverse all that by keeping silence with you just now. When somebody\nsaid to me, ‘Young Vincy has taken to being at the billiard-table every\nnight again—he won’t bear the curb long;’ I was tempted to do the\nopposite of what I am doing—to hold my tongue and wait while you went\ndown the ladder again, betting first and then—”“I have not made any bets,” said Fred, hastily.“Glad to hear it. But I say, my prompting was to look on and see you\ntake the wrong turning, wear out Garth’s patience, and lose the best\nopportunity of your life—the opportunity which you made some rather\ndifficult effort to secure. You can guess the feeling which raised that\ntemptation in me—I am sure you know it. I am sure you know that the\nsatisfaction of your affections stands in the way of mine.”There was a pause. Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a recognition of\nthe fact; and the emotion perceptible in the tones of his fine voice\ngave solemnity to his words. But no feeling could quell Fred’s alarm.“I could not be expected to give her up,” he said, after a moment’s\nhesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity."

  "content": "“Clearly not, when her affection met yours. But relations of this sort,\neven when they are of long standing, are always liable to change. I can\neasily conceive that you might act in a way to loosen the tie she feels\ntowards you—it must be remembered that she is only conditionally bound\nto you—and that in that case, another man, who may flatter himself that\nhe has a hold on her regard, might succeed in winning that firm place\nin her love as well as respect which you had let slip. I can easily\nconceive such a result,” repeated Mr. Farebrother, emphatically. “There\nis a companionship of ready sympathy, which might get the advantage\neven over the longest associations.” It seemed to Fred that if Mr.\nFarebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his very capable\ntongue, his mode of attack could hardly be more cruel. He had a\nhorrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement there was\na knowledge of some actual change in Mary’s feeling.“Of course I know it might easily be all up with me,” he said, in a\ntroubled voice. “If she is beginning to compare—” He broke off, not\nliking to betray all he felt, and then said, by the help of a little\nbitterness, “But I thought you were friendly to me.”“So I am; that is why we are here. But I have had a strong disposition\nto be otherwise. I have said to myself, ‘If there is a likelihood of\nthat youngster doing himself harm, why should you interfere? Aren’t you\nworth as much as he is, and don’t your sixteen years over and above\nhis, in which you have gone rather hungry, give you more right to\nsatisfaction than he has? If there’s a chance of his going to the dogs,\nlet him—perhaps you could nohow hinder it—and do you take the\nbenefit.’”There was a pause, in which Fred was seized by a most uncomfortable\nchill. What was coming next? He dreaded to hear that something had been\nsaid to Mary—he felt as if he were listening to a threat rather than a\nwarning. When the Vicar began again there was a change in his tone like\nthe encouraging transition to a major key.“But I had once meant better than that, and I am come back to my old\nintention. I thought that I could hardly _secure myself_ in it better,\nFred, than by telling you just what had gone on in me. And now, do you\nunderstand me? I want you to make the happiness of her life and your\nown, and if there is any chance that a word of warning from me may turn\naside any risk to the contrary—well, I have uttered it.”There was a drop in the Vicar’s voice when he spoke the last words. He\npaused—they were standing on a patch of green where the road diverged\ntowards St. Botolph’s, and he put out his hand, as if to imply that the\nconversation was closed. Fred was moved quite newly. Some one highly\nsusceptible to the contemplation of a fine act has said, that it\nproduces a sort of regenerating shudder through the frame, and makes\none feel ready to begin a new life. A good degree of that effect was\njust then present in Fred Vincy."
