  "content": "Who shall tell what may be the effect of writing? If it happens to have\nbeen cut in stone, though it lie face down-most for ages on a forsaken\nbeach, or “rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many\nconquests,” it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and\nother scandals gossiped about long empires ago:—this world being\napparently a huge whispering-gallery. Such conditions are often\nminutely represented in our petty lifetimes. As the stone which has\nbeen kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links\nof effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at\nlast fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink\nand paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at\nlast be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge\nenough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe. To Uriel watching\nthe progress of planetary history from the sun, the one result would be\njust as much of a coincidence as the other.Having made this rather lofty comparison I am less uneasy in calling\nattention to the existence of low people by whose interference, however\nlittle we may like it, the course of the world is very much determined.\nIt would be well, certainly, if we could help to reduce their number,\nand something might perhaps be done by not lightly giving occasion to\ntheir existence. Socially speaking, Joshua Rigg would have been\ngenerally pronounced a superfluity. But those who like Peter\nFeatherstone never had a copy of themselves demanded, are the very last\nto wait for such a request either in prose or verse. The copy in this\ncase bore more of outside resemblance to the mother, in whose sex\nfrog-features, accompanied with fresh-colored cheeks and a well-rounded\nfigure, are compatible with much charm for a certain order of admirers.\nThe result is sometimes a frog-faced male, desirable, surely, to no\norder of intelligent beings. Especially when he is suddenly brought\ninto evidence to frustrate other people’s expectations—the very lowest\naspect in which a social superfluity can present himself."

  "content": "But Mr. Rigg Featherstone’s low characteristics were all of the sober,\nwater-drinking kind. From the earliest to the latest hour of the day he\nwas always as sleek, neat, and cool as the frog he resembled, and old\nPeter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more calculating,\nand far more imperturbable, than himself. I will add that his\nfinger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and that he meant to marry\na well-educated young lady (as yet unspecified) whose person was good,\nand whose connections, in a solid middle-class way, were undeniable.\nThus his nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen;\nthough his ambition had been educated only by the opportunities of a\nclerk and accountant in the smaller commercial houses of a seaport. He\nthought the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people, and they in\ntheir turn regarded his “bringing up” in a seaport town as an\nexaggeration of the monstrosity that their brother Peter, and still\nmore Peter’s property, should have had such belongings.The garden and gravel approach, as seen from the two windows of the\nwainscoted parlor at Stone Court, were never in better trim than now,\nwhen Mr. Rigg Featherstone stood, with his hands behind him, looking\nout on these grounds as their master. But it seemed doubtful whether he\nlooked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning his back to a\nperson who stood in the middle of the room, with his legs considerably\napart and his hands in his trouser-pockets: a person in all respects a\ncontrast to the sleek and cool Rigg. He was a man obviously on the way\ntowards sixty, very florid and hairy, with much gray in his bushy\nwhiskers and thick curly hair, a stoutish body which showed to\ndisadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of his clothes, and the air of\na swaggerer, who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of\nfireworks, regarding his own remarks on any other person’s performance\nas likely to be more interesting than the performance itself.His name was John Raffles, and he sometimes wrote jocosely W.A.G. after\nhis signature, observing when he did so, that he was once taught by\nLeonard Lamb of Finsbury who wrote B.A. after his name, and that he,\nRaffles, originated the witticism of calling that celebrated principal\nBa-Lamb. Such were the appearance and mental flavor of Mr. Raffles,\nboth of which seemed to have a stale odor of travellers’ rooms in the\ncommercial hotels of that period.“Come, now, Josh,” he was saying, in a full rumbling tone, “look at it\nin this light: here is your poor mother going into the vale of years,\nand you could afford something handsome now to make her comfortable.”“Not while you live. Nothing would make her comfortable while you\nlive,” returned Rigg, in his cool high voice. “What I give her, you’ll\ntake.”"

The tobacco trade is growing. I should\ncut my own nose off in not doing the best I could at it. I should stick\nto it like a flea to a fleece for my own sake. I should always be on\nthe spot. And nothing would make your poor mother so happy. I’ve pretty\nwell done with my wild oats—turned fifty-five. I want to settle down in\nmy chimney-corner. And if I once buckled to the tobacco trade, I could\nbring an amount of brains and experience to bear on it that would not\nbe found elsewhere in a hurry. I don’t want to be bothering you one\ntime after another, but to get things once for all into the right\nchannel. Consider that, Josh—as between man and man—and with your poor\nmother to be made easy for her life. I was always fond of the old\nwoman, by Jove!”“Have you done?” said Mr. Rigg, quietly, without looking away from the\nwindow.“Yes, _I_’ve done,” said Raffles, taking hold of his hat which stood\nbefore him on the table, and giving it a sort of oratorical push.“Then just listen to me. The more you say anything, the less I shall\nbelieve it. The more you want me to do a thing, the more reason I shall\nhave for never doing it. Do you think I mean to forget your kicking me\nwhen I was a lad, and eating all the best victual away from me and my\nmother? Do you think I forget your always coming home to sell and\npocket everything, and going off again leaving us in the lurch? I\nshould be glad to see you whipped at the cart-tail. My mother was a\nfool to you: she’d no right to give me a father-in-law, and she’s been\npunished for it. She shall have her weekly allowance paid and no more:\nand that shall be stopped if you dare to come on to these premises\nagain, or to come into this country after me again. The next time you\nshow yourself inside the gates here, you shall be driven off with the\ndogs and the wagoner’s whip.”As Rigg pronounced the last words he turned round and looked at Raffles\nwith his prominent frozen eyes. The contrast was as striking as it\ncould have been eighteen years before, when Rigg was a most unengaging\nkickable boy, and Raffles was the rather thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms\nand back-parlors. But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg, and\nauditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles\nwould retire with the air of a defeated dog. Not at all. He made a\ngrimace which was habitual with him whenever he was “out” in a game;\nthen subsided into a laugh, and drew a brandy-flask from his pocket.“Come, Josh,” he said, in a cajoling tone, “give us a spoonful of\nbrandy, and a sovereign to pay the way back, and I’ll go. Honor bright!\nI’ll go like a bullet, _by_ Jove!”"

I don’t own you any more than if I saw a\ncrow; and if you want to own me you’ll get nothing by it but a\ncharacter for being what you are—a spiteful, brassy, bullying rogue.”“That’s a pity, now, Josh,” said Raffles, affecting to scratch his head\nand wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed. “I’m very fond\nof you; _by_ Jove, I am! There’s nothing I like better than plaguing\nyou—you’re so like your mother, and I must do without it. But the\nbrandy and the sovereign’s a bargain.”He jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau\nwith his keys. But Raffles had reminded himself by his movement with\nthe flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather\ncovering, and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within\nthe fender, he took it up and shoved it under the leather so as to make\nthe glass firm.By that time Rigg came forward with a brandy-bottle, filled the flask,\nand handed Raffles a sovereign, neither looking at him nor speaking to\nhim. After locking up the bureau again, he walked to the window and\ngazed out as impassibly as he had done at the beginning of the\ninterview, while Raffles took a small allowance from the flask, screwed\nit up, and deposited it in his side-pocket, with provoking slowness,\nmaking a grimace at his stepson’s back.“Farewell, Josh—and if forever!” said Raffles, turning back his head as\nhe opened the door.Rigg saw him leave the grounds and enter the lane. The gray day had\nturned to a light drizzling rain, which freshened the hedgerows and the\ngrassy borders of the by-roads, and hastened the laborers who were\nloading the last shocks of corn. Raffles, walking with the uneasy gait\nof a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot,\nlooked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if he\nhad been a baboon escaped from a menagerie. But there were none to\nstare at him except the long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of\nhis appearance except the little water-rats which rustled away at his\napproach."

Mr.\nRaffles on most occasions kept up the sense of having been educated at\nan academy, and being able, if he chose, to pass well everywhere;\nindeed, there was not one of his fellow-men whom he did not feel\nhimself in a position to ridicule and torment, confident of the\nentertainment which he thus gave to all the rest of the company.He played this part now with as much spirit as if his journey had been\nentirely successful, resorting at frequent intervals to his flask. The\npaper with which he had wedged it was a letter signed _Nicholas\nBulstrode_, but Raffles was not likely to disturb it from its present\nuseful position.CHAPTER XLII.How much, methinks, I could despise this man\nWere I not bound in charity against it!\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Henry VIII_.One of the professional calls made by Lydgate soon after his return\nfrom his wedding-journey was to Lowick Manor, in consequence of a\nletter which had requested him to fix a time for his visit.Mr. Casaubon had never put any question concerning the nature of his\nillness to Lydgate, nor had he even to Dorothea betrayed any anxiety as\nto how far it might be likely to cut short his labors or his life. On\nthis point, as on all others, he shrank from pity; and if the suspicion\nof being pitied for anything in his lot surmised or known in spite of\nhimself was embittering, the idea of calling forth a show of compassion\nby frankly admitting an alarm or a sorrow was necessarily intolerable\nto him. Every proud mind knows something of this experience, and\nperhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough\nto make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of\nexalting."

  "content": "But Mr. Casaubon was now brooding over something through which the\nquestion of his health and life haunted his silence with a more\nharassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of his\nauthorship. It is true that this last might be called his central\nambition; but there are some kinds of authorship in which by far the\nlargest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated in the\nconsciousness of the author—one knows of the river by a few streaks\namid a long-gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud. That was the way\nwith Mr. Casaubon’s hard intellectual labors. Their most characteristic\nresult was not the “Key to all Mythologies,” but a morbid consciousness\nthat others did not give him the place which he had not demonstrably\nmerited—a perpetual suspicious conjecture that the views entertained of\nhim were not to his advantage—a melancholy absence of passion in his\nefforts at achievement, and a passionate resistance to the confession\nthat he had achieved nothing.Thus his intellectual ambition which seemed to others to have absorbed\nand dried him, was really no security against wounds, least of all\nagainst those which came from Dorothea. And he had begun now to frame\npossibilities for the future which were somehow more embittering to him\nthan anything his mind had dwelt on before.Against certain facts he was helpless: against Will Ladislaw’s\nexistence, his defiant stay in the neighborhood of Lowick, and his\nflippant state of mind with regard to the possessors of authentic,\nwell-stamped erudition: against Dorothea’s nature, always taking on\nsome new shape of ardent activity, and even in submission and silence\ncovering fervid reasons which it was an irritation to think of: against\ncertain notions and likings which had taken possession of her mind in\nrelation to subjects that he could not possibly discuss with her. There\nwas no denying that Dorothea was as virtuous and lovely a young lady as\nhe could have obtained for a wife; but a young lady turned out to be\nsomething more troublesome than he had conceived. She nursed him, she\nread to him, she anticipated his wants, and was solicitous about his\nfeelings; but there had entered into the husband’s mind the certainty\nthat she judged him, and that her wifely devotedness was like a\npenitential expiation of unbelieving thoughts—was accompanied with a\npower of comparison by which himself and his doings were seen too\nluminously as a part of things in general. His discontent passed\nvapor-like through all her gentle loving manifestations, and clung to\nthat inappreciative world which she had only brought nearer to him."

  "content": "Poor Mr. Casaubon! This suffering was the harder to bear because it\nseemed like a betrayal: the young creature who had worshipped him with\nperfect trust had quickly turned into the critical wife; and early\ninstances of criticism and resentment had made an impression which no\ntenderness and submission afterwards could remove. To his suspicious\ninterpretation Dorothea’s silence now was a suppressed rebellion; a\nremark from her which he had not in any way anticipated was an\nassertion of conscious superiority; her gentle answers had an\nirritating cautiousness in them; and when she acquiesced it was a\nself-approved effort of forbearance. The tenacity with which he strove\nto hide this inward drama made it the more vivid for him; as we hear\nwith the more keenness what we wish others not to hear.Instead of wondering at this result of misery in Mr. Casaubon, I think\nit quite ordinary. Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot\nout the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the\nblot? I know no speck so troublesome as self. And who, if Mr. Casaubon\nhad chosen to expound his discontents—his suspicions that he was not\nany longer adored without criticism—could have denied that they were\nfounded on good reasons? On the contrary, there was a strong reason to\nbe added, which he had not himself taken explicitly into\naccount—namely, that he was not unmixedly adorable. He suspected this,\nhowever, as he suspected other things, without confessing it, and like\nthe rest of us, felt how soothing it would have been to have a\ncompanion who would never find it out."

  "content": "This sore susceptibility in relation to Dorothea was thoroughly\nprepared before Will Ladislaw had returned to Lowick, and what had\noccurred since then had brought Mr. Casaubon’s power of suspicious\nconstruction into exasperated activity. To all the facts which he knew,\nhe added imaginary facts both present and future which became more real\nto him than those because they called up a stronger dislike, a more\npredominating bitterness. Suspicion and jealousy of Will Ladislaw’s\nintentions, suspicion and jealousy of Dorothea’s impressions, were\nconstantly at their weaving work. It would be quite unjust to him to\nsuppose that he could have entered into any coarse misinterpretation of\nDorothea: his own habits of mind and conduct, quite as much as the open\nelevation of her nature, saved him from any such mistake. What he was\njealous of was her opinion, the sway that might be given to her ardent\nmind in its judgments, and the future possibilities to which these\nmight lead her. As to Will, though until his last defiant letter he had\nnothing definite which he would choose formally to allege against him,\nhe felt himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any\ndesign which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined\nimpulsiveness. He was quite sure that Dorothea was the cause of Will’s\nreturn from Rome, and his determination to settle in the neighborhood;\nand he was penetrating enough to imagine that Dorothea had innocently\nencouraged this course. It was as clear as possible that she was ready\nto be attached to Will and to be pliant to his suggestions: they had\nnever had a _tête-à-tête_ without her bringing away from it some new\ntroublesome impression, and the last interview that Mr. Casaubon was\naware of (Dorothea, on returning from Freshitt Hall, had for the first\ntime been silent about having seen Will) had led to a scene which\nroused an angrier feeling against them both than he had ever known\nbefore. Dorothea’s outpouring of her notions about money, in the\ndarkness of the night, had done nothing but bring a mixture of more\nodious foreboding into her husband’s mind."

He was certainly much revived; he had recovered all his usual\npower of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there\nmight still be twenty years of achievement before him, which would\njustify the thirty years of preparation. That prospect was made the\nsweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp &\nCompany; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his taper among the\ntombs of the past, those modern figures came athwart the dim light, and\ninterrupted his diligent exploration. To convince Carp of his mistake,\nso that he would have to eat his own words with a good deal of\nindigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship,\nwhich the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all\neternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus,\nthe prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter\nsavors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less\nsurprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other\npersons, when he himself should have entered into glory, had not a\npotently sweetening effect. If the truth should be that some\nundermining disease was at work within him, there might be large\nopportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone; and if\none of those people should be Will Ladislaw, Mr. Casaubon objected so\nstrongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his\ndisembodied existence."

  "content": "This is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the\ncase. The human soul moves in many channels, and Mr. Casaubon, we know,\nhad a sense of rectitude and an honorable pride in satisfying the\nrequirements of honor, which compelled him to find other reasons for\nhis conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness. The way in which\nMr. Casaubon put the case was this:—“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had\nto care for her well-being in case of my death. But well-being is not\nto be secured by ample, independent possession of property; on the\ncontrary, occasions might arise in which such possession might expose\nher to the more danger. She is ready prey to any man who knows how to\nplay adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her Quixotic\nenthusiasm; and a man stands by with that very intention in his mind—a\nman with no other principle than transient caprice, and who has a\npersonal animosity towards me—I am sure of it—an animosity which is fed\nby the consciousness of his ingratitude, and which he has constantly\nvented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had heard it.\nEven if I live I shall not be without uneasiness as to what he may\nattempt through indirect influence. This man has gained Dorothea’s ear:\nhe has fascinated her attention; he has evidently tried to impress her\nmind with the notion that he has claims beyond anything I have done for\nhim. If I die—and he is waiting here on the watch for that—he will\npersuade her to marry him. That would be calamity for her and success\nfor him. _She_ would not think it calamity: he would make her believe\nanything; she has a tendency to immoderate attachment which she\ninwardly reproaches me for not responding to, and already her mind is\noccupied with his fortunes. He thinks of an easy conquest and of\nentering into my nest. That I will hinder! Such a marriage would be\nfatal to Dorothea. Has he ever persisted in anything except from\ncontradiction? In knowledge he has always tried to be showy at small\ncost. In religion he could be, as long as it suited him, the facile\necho of Dorothea’s vagaries. When was sciolism ever dissociated from\nlaxity? I utterly distrust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to\nthe utmost the fulfilment of his designs.”"

You need not see him, my dear. I shall give\norders that he may be sent to me in the Yew-tree Walk, where I shall be\ntaking my usual exercise.”When Lydgate entered the Yew-tree Walk he saw Mr. Casaubon slowly\nreceding with his hands behind him according to his habit, and his head\nbent forward. It was a lovely afternoon; the leaves from the lofty\nlimes were falling silently across the sombre evergreens, while the\nlights and shadows slept side by side: there was no sound but the\ncawing of the rooks, which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby, or that\nlast solemn lullaby, a dirge. Lydgate, conscious of an energetic frame\nin its prime, felt some compassion when the figure which he was likely\nsoon to overtake turned round, and in advancing towards him showed more\nmarkedly than ever the signs of premature age—the student’s bent\nshoulders, the emaciated limbs, and the melancholy lines of the mouth.\n“Poor fellow,” he thought, “some men with his years are like lions; one\ncan tell nothing of their age except that they are full grown.”“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, with his invariably polite air, “I am\nexceedingly obliged to you for your punctuality. We will, if you\nplease, carry on our conversation in walking to and fro.”“I hope your wish to see me is not due to the return of unpleasant\nsymptoms,” said Lydgate, filling up a pause."

In short, I have long had on hand a work which I would fain\nleave behind me in such a state, at least, that it might be committed\nto the press by—others. Were I assured that this is the utmost I can\nreasonably expect, that assurance would be a useful circumscription of\nmy attempts, and a guide in both the positive and negative\ndetermination of my course.”Here Mr. Casaubon paused, removed one hand from his back and thrust it\nbetween the buttons of his single-breasted coat. To a mind largely\ninstructed in the human destiny hardly anything could be more\ninteresting than the inward conflict implied in his formal measured\naddress, delivered with the usual sing-song and motion of the head.\nNay, are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle\nof the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the\nsignificance of its life—a significance which is to vanish as the\nwaters which come and go where no man has need of them? But there was\nnothing to strike others as sublime about Mr. Casaubon, and Lydgate,\nwho had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship, felt a little\namusement mingling with his pity.

You have not implied to me that the symptoms which—I am bound to\ntestify—you watched with scrupulous care, were those of a fatal\ndisease. But were it so, Mr. Lydgate, I should desire to know the truth\nwithout reservation, and I appeal to you for an exact statement of your\nconclusions: I request it as a friendly service.

A good deal of experience—a more lengthened\nobservation—is wanting on the subject. But after what you have said, it\nis my duty to tell you that death from this disease is often sudden. At\nthe same time, no such result can be predicted. Your condition may be\nconsistent with a tolerably comfortable life for another fifteen years,\nor even more. I could add no information to this beyond anatomical or\nmedical details, which would leave expectation at precisely the same\npoint.” Lydgate’s instinct was fine enough to tell him that plain\nspeech, quite free from ostentatious caution, would be felt by Mr.\nCasaubon as a tribute of respect.“I thank you, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, after a moment’s pause.\n“One thing more I have still to ask: did you communicate what you have\nnow told me to Mrs. Casaubon?”“Partly—I mean, as to the possible issues.” Lydgate was going to\nexplain why he had told Dorothea, but Mr. Casaubon, with an\nunmistakable desire to end the conversation, waved his hand slightly,\nand said again, “I thank you,” proceeding to remark on the rare beauty\nof the day."

Here was a man who now for the first time found himself\nlooking into the eyes of death—who was passing through one of those\nrare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace,\nwhich is as different from what we call knowing it, as the vision of\nwaters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the\nwater which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue. When the\ncommonplace “We must all die” transforms itself suddenly into the acute\nconsciousness “I must die—and soon,” then death grapples us, and his\nfingers are cruel; afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as\nour mother did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be\nlike the first. To Mr. Casaubon now, it was as if he suddenly found\nhimself on the dark river-brink and heard the plash of the oncoming\noar, not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons. In such an\nhour the mind does not change its lifelong bias, but carries it onward\nin imagination to the other side of death, gazing backward—perhaps with\nthe divine calm of beneficence, perhaps with the petty anxieties of\nself-assertion. What was Mr. Casaubon’s bias his acts will give us a\nclew to. He held himself to be, with some private scholarly\nreservations, a believing Christian, as to estimates of the present and\nhopes of the future. But what we strive to gratify, though we may call\nit a distant hope, is an immediate desire: the future estate for which\nmen drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love.\nAnd Mr. Casaubon’s immediate desire was not for divine communion and\nlight divested of earthly conditions; his passionate longings, poor\nman, clung low and mist-like in very shady places."

Then she went towards him, and might have represented a\nheaven-sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining\nshould yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to\na comprehended grief. His glance in reply to hers was so chill that she\nfelt her timidity increased; yet she turned and passed her hand through\nhis arm.Mr. Casaubon kept his hands behind him and allowed her pliant arm to\ncling with difficulty against his rigid arm.There was something horrible to Dorothea in the sensation which this\nunresponsive hardness inflicted on her. That is a strong word, but not\ntoo strong: it is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of\njoy are forever wasted, until men and women look round with haggard\nfaces at the devastation their own waste has made, and say, the earth\nbears no harvest of sweetness—calling their denial knowledge. You may\nask why, in the name of manliness, Mr. Casaubon should have behaved in\nthat way. Consider that his was a mind which shrank from pity: have you\never watched in such a mind the effect of a suspicion that what is\npressing it as a grief may be really a source of contentment, either\nactual or future, to the being who already offends by pitying? Besides,\nhe knew little of Dorothea’s sensations, and had not reflected that on\nsuch an occasion as the present they were comparable in strength to his\nown sensibilities about Carp’s criticisms."

He entered\nthe library and shut himself in, alone with his sorrow.She went up to her boudoir. The open bow-window let in the serene glory\nof the afternoon lying in the avenue, where the lime-trees cast long\nshadows. But Dorothea knew nothing of the scene. She threw herself on a\nchair, not heeding that she was in the dazzling sun-rays: if there were\ndiscomfort in that, how could she tell that it was not part of her\ninward misery?She was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any she had\nfelt since her marriage. Instead of tears there came words:—“What have I done—what am I—that he should treat me so? He never knows\nwhat is in my mind—he never cares. What is the use of anything I do? He\nwishes he had never married me.”She began to hear herself, and was checked into stillness. Like one who\nhas lost his way and is weary, she sat and saw as in one glance all the\npaths of her young hope which she should never find again. And just as\nclearly in the miserable light she saw her own and her husband’s\nsolitude—how they walked apart so that she was obliged to survey him.\nIf he had drawn her towards him, she would never have surveyed\nhim—never have said, “Is he worth living for?” but would have felt him\nsimply a part of her own life. Now she said bitterly, “It is his fault,\nnot mine.” In the jar of her whole being, Pity was overthrown. Was it\nher fault that she had believed in him—had believed in his\nworthiness?—And what, exactly, was he?— She was able enough to estimate\nhim—she who waited on his glances with trembling, and shut her best\nsoul in prison, paying it only hidden visits, that she might be petty\nenough to please him. In such a crisis as this, some women begin to\nhate."

  "content": "The sun was low when Dorothea was thinking that she would not go down\nagain, but would send a message to her husband saying that she was not\nwell and preferred remaining up-stairs. She had never deliberately\nallowed her resentment to govern her in this way before, but she\nbelieved now that she could not see him again without telling him the\ntruth about her feeling, and she must wait till she could do it without\ninterruption. He might wonder and be hurt at her message. It was good\nthat he should wonder and be hurt. Her anger said, as anger is apt to\nsay, that God was with her—that all heaven, though it were crowded with\nspirits watching them, must be on her side. She had determined to ring\nher bell, when there came a rap at the door.Mr. Casaubon had sent to say that he would have his dinner in the\nlibrary. He wished to be quite alone this evening, being much occupied.“I shall not dine, then, Tantripp.”“Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?”“No; I am not well. Get everything ready in my dressing room, but pray\ndo not disturb me again.”Dorothea sat almost motionless in her meditative struggle, while the\nevening slowly deepened into night. But the struggle changed\ncontinually, as that of a man who begins with a movement towards\nstriking and ends with conquering his desire to strike. The energy that\nwould animate a crime is not more than is wanted to inspire a resolved\nsubmission, when the noble habit of the soul reasserts itself. That\nthought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her husband—her\nconviction that he had been asking about the possible arrest of all his\nwork, and that the answer must have wrung his heart, could not be long\nwithout rising beside the image of him, like a shadowy monitor looking\nat her anger with sad remonstrance. It cost her a litany of pictured\nsorrows and of silent cries that she might be the mercy for those\nsorrows—but the resolved submission did come; and when the house was\nstill, and she knew that it was near the time when Mr. Casaubon\nhabitually went to rest, she opened her door gently and stood outside\nin the darkness waiting for his coming up-stairs with a light in his\nhand. If he did not come soon she thought that she would go down and\neven risk incurring another pang. She would never again expect anything\nelse. But she did hear the library door open, and slowly the light\nadvanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the\ncarpet. When her husband stood opposite to her, she saw that his face\nwas more haggard. He started slightly on seeing her, and she looked up\nat him beseechingly, without speaking.“Dorothea!” he said, with a gentle surprise in his tone. “Were you\nwaiting for me?”“Yes, I did not like to disturb you.”"

You are young, and need not to extend your life\nby watching.”When the kind quiet melancholy of that speech fell on Dorothea’s ears,\nshe felt something like the thankfulness that might well up in us if we\nhad narrowly escaped hurting a lamed creature. She put her hand into\nher husband’s, and they went along the broad corridor together.BOOK V.\nTHE DEAD HAND.CHAPTER XLIII.“This figure hath high price: ’t was wrought with love\nAges ago in finest ivory;\nNought modish in it, pure and noble lines\nOf generous womanhood that fits all time\nThat too is costly ware; majolica\nOf deft design, to please a lordly eye:\nThe smile, you see, is perfect—wonderful\nAs mere Faience! a table ornament\nTo suit the richest mounting.”Dorothea seldom left home without her husband, but she did occasionally\ndrive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of shopping or charity\nsuch as occur to every lady of any wealth when she lives within three\nmiles of a town. Two days after that scene in the Yew-tree Walk, she\ndetermined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see\nLydgate, and learn from him whether her husband had really felt any\ndepressing change of symptoms which he was concealing from her, and\nwhether he had insisted on knowing the utmost about himself. She felt\nalmost guilty in asking for knowledge about him from another, but the\ndread of being without it—the dread of that ignorance which would make\nher unjust or hard—overcame every scruple. That there had been some\ncrisis in her husband’s mind she was certain: he had the very next day\nbegun a new method of arranging his notes, and had associated her quite\nnewly in carrying out his plan. Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores\nof patience.It was about four o’clock when she drove to Lydgate’s house in Lowick\nGate, wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at home, that she\nhad written beforehand. And he was not at home.“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea, who had never, that she knew\nof, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage. Yes,\nMrs. Lydgate was at home."

Will you ask her\nif she can see me—see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?”When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea could hear\nsounds of music through an open window—a few notes from a man’s voice\nand then a piano bursting into roulades. But the roulades broke off\nsuddenly, and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would\nbe happy to see Mrs. Casaubon."

Let those who know, tell us\nexactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in those days of mild\nautumn—that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the\neye. It always seemed to have been lately washed, and to smell of the\nsweet hedges—was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging\nall out of the fashion. Yet if she had entered before a still audience\nas Imogene or Cato’s daughter, the dress might have seemed right\nenough: the grace and dignity were in her limbs and neck; and about her\nsimply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then\nin the fate of women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold\ntrencher we call a halo. By the present audience of two persons, no\ndramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs.\nCasaubon. To Rosamond she was one of those county divinities not mixing\nwith Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner or\nappearance were worthy of her study; moreover, Rosamond was not without\nsatisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying\n_her_. What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the\nbest judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at\nSir Godwin Lydgate’s, she felt quite confident of the impression she\nmust make on people of good birth. Dorothea put out her hand with her\nusual simple kindness, and looked admiringly at Lydgate’s lovely\nbride—aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but\nseeing him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle. The gentleman was\ntoo much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on the\ncontrast between the two—a contrast that would certainly have been\nstriking to a calm observer. They were both tall, and their eyes were\non a level; but imagine Rosamond’s infantine blondness and wondrous\ncrown of hair-plaits, with her pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so\nperfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a large\nembroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders would know\nthe price of, her small hands duly set off with rings, and that\ncontrolled self-consciousness of manner which is the expensive\nsubstitute for simplicity."

But I can send for him.”“Will you let me go and fetch him?” said Will Ladislaw, coming forward.\nHe had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered. She colored\nwith surprise, but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable\npleasure, saying—“I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here.”“May I go to the Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to see\nhim?” said Will.“It would be quicker to send the carriage for him,” said Dorothea, “if\nyou will be kind enough to give the message to the coachman.”Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an\ninstant over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, “I will\ngo myself, thank you. I wish to lose no time before getting home again.\nI will drive to the Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there. Pray excuse me,\nMrs. Lydgate. I am very much obliged to you.”Her mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she left\nthe room hardly conscious of what was immediately around her—hardly\nconscious that Will opened the door for her and offered her his arm to\nlead her to the carriage. She took the arm but said nothing. Will was\nfeeling rather vexed and miserable, and found nothing to say on his\nside. He handed her into the carriage in silence, they said good-by,\nand Dorothea drove away."

  "content": "In the five minutes’ drive to the Hospital she had time for some\nreflections that were quite new to her. Her decision to go, and her\npreoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that\nthere would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any\nfurther intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to\nmention to her husband, and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a\nmatter of concealment. That was all that had been explicitly in her\nmind; but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort. Now that she\nwas alone in her drive, she heard the notes of the man’s voice and the\naccompanying piano, which she had not noted much at the time, returning\non her inward sense; and she found herself thinking with some wonder\nthat Will Ladislaw was passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her\nhusband’s absence. And then she could not help remembering that he had\npassed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there\nbe any unfitness in the fact? But Will was Mr. Casaubon’s relative, and\none towards whom she was bound to show kindness. Still there had been\nsigns which perhaps she ought to have understood as implying that Mr.\nCasaubon did not like his cousin’s visits during his own absence.\n“Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,” said poor Dorothea to\nherself, while the tears came rolling and she had to dry them quickly.\nShe felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so\nclear to her before was mysteriously spoiled. But the carriage stopped\nat the gate of the Hospital. She was soon walking round the grass plots\nwith Lydgate, and her feelings recovered the strong bent which had made\nher seek for this interview."

  "content": "Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of it\nclearly enough. His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and here for\nthe first time there had come a chance which had set him at a\ndisadvantage. It was not only, as it had been hitherto, that she was\nnot supremely occupied with him, but that she had seen him under\ncircumstances in which he might appear not to be supremely occupied\nwith her. He felt thrust to a new distance from her, amongst the\ncircles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life. But that was\nnot his fault: of course, since he had taken his lodgings in the town,\nhe had been making as many acquaintances as he could, his position\nrequiring that he should know everybody and everything. Lydgate was\nreally better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood, and\nhe happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling\nupon. Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had\ndescended too unexpectedly on her worshipper. It was mortifying. Will\nwas conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but for\nDorothea; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him from\nher with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to\nthe persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome\nand Britain. Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy\nin the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices,\nlike odorous bodies, have a double existence both solid and\nsubtle—solid as the pyramids, subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo,\nor as the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness. And Will\nwas of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties: a man\nof clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as he did, that for the\nfirst time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had\nsprung up in Dorothea’s mind, and that their silence, as he conducted\nher to the carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Casaubon, in his\nhatred and jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid\nbelow her socially. Confound Casaubon!"

May I come\nanother day and just finish about the rendering of ‘Lungi dal caro\nbene’?”“I shall be happy to be taught,” said Rosamond. “But I am sure you\nadmit that the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your\nacquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she very clever? She looks as if\nshe were.”“Really, I never thought about it,” said Will, sulkily.“That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him if she\nwere handsome. What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of when you\nare with Mrs. Casaubon?”“Herself,” said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs.\nLydgate. “When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of her\nattributes—one is conscious of her presence.”“I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,” said Rosamond,\ndimpling, and speaking with aery lightness. “He will come back and\nthink nothing of me.”“That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto. Mrs.\nCasaubon is too unlike other women for them to be compared with her.”“You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see her, I\nsuppose.”“No,” said Will, almost pettishly. “Worship is usually a matter of\ntheory rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess just\nat this moment—I must really tear myself away.”“Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music,\nand I cannot enjoy it so well without him.”When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of\nhim and holding his coat-collar with both her hands, “Mr. Ladislaw was\nhere singing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in. He seemed vexed. Do\nyou think he disliked her seeing him at our house? Surely your position\nis more than equal to his—whatever may be his relation to the\nCasaubons.”"
