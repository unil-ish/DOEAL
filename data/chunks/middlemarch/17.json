  "content": "“Do find a fitter word than nasty, my dear Alfred, for everything that\nyou think disagreeable. And suppose that Mary could help you to go to\nMr. Hanmer’s with the money she gets?”“That seems to me a great shame. But she’s an old brick,” said Alfred,\nrising from his chair, and pulling Mary’s head backward to kiss her.Mary colored and laughed, but could not conceal that the tears were\ncoming. Caleb, looking on over his spectacles, with the angles of his\neyebrows falling, had an expression of mingled delight and sorrow as he\nreturned to the opening of his letter; and even Mrs. Garth, her lips\ncurling with a calm contentment, allowed that inappropriate language to\npass without correction, although Ben immediately took it up, and sang,\n“She’s an old brick, old brick, old brick!” to a cantering measure,\nwhich he beat out with his fist on Mary’s arm.But Mrs. Garth’s eyes were now drawn towards her husband, who was\nalready deep in the letter he was reading. His face had an expression\nof grave surprise, which alarmed her a little, but he did not like to\nbe questioned while he was reading, and she remained anxiously watching\ntill she saw him suddenly shaken by a little joyous laugh as he turned\nback to the beginning of the letter, and looking at her above his\nspectacles, said, in a low tone, “What do you think, Susan?”She went and stood behind him, putting her hand on his shoulder, while\nthey read the letter together. It was from Sir James Chettam, offering\nto Mr. Garth the management of the family estates at Freshitt and\nelsewhere, and adding that Sir James had been requested by Mr. Brooke\nof Tipton to ascertain whether Mr. Garth would be disposed at the same\ntime to resume the agency of the Tipton property. The Baronet added in\nvery obliging words that he himself was particularly desirous of seeing\nthe Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same management, and he hoped\nto be able to show that the double agency might be held on terms\nagreeable to Mr. Garth, whom he would be glad to see at the Hall at\ntwelve o’clock on the following day."

That shows\nthat he did his work well, so that they feel the want of him.”“Like Cincinnatus—hooray!” said Ben, riding on his chair, with a\npleasant confidence that discipline was relaxed.“Will they come to fetch him, mother?” said Letty, thinking of the\nMayor and Corporation in their robes.Mrs. Garth patted Letty’s head and smiled, but seeing that her husband\nwas gathering up his letters and likely soon to be out of reach in that\nsanctuary “business,” she pressed his shoulder and said emphatically—“Now, mind you ask fair pay, Caleb.”“Oh yes,” said Caleb, in a deep voice of assent, as if it would be\nunreasonable to suppose anything else of him. “It’ll come to between\nfour and five hundred, the two together.” Then with a little start of\nremembrance he said, “Mary, write and give up that school. Stay and\nhelp your mother. I’m as pleased as Punch, now I’ve thought of that.”No manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant than\nCaleb’s, but his talents did not lie in finding phrases, though he was\nvery particular about his letter-writing, and regarded his wife as a\ntreasury of correct language.There was almost an uproar among the children now, and Mary held up the\ncambric embroidery towards her mother entreatingly, that it might be\nput out of reach while the boys dragged her into a dance. Mrs. Garth,\nin placid joy, began to put the cups and plates together, while Caleb\npushing his chair from the table, as if he were going to move to the\ndesk, still sat holding his letters in his hand and looking on the\nground meditatively, stretching out the fingers of his left hand,\naccording to a mute language of his own. At last he said—"

  "content": "“It’s a thousand pities Christy didn’t take to business, Susan. I shall\nwant help by-and-by. And Alfred must go off to the engineering—I’ve\nmade up my mind to that.” He fell into meditation and finger-rhetoric\nagain for a little while, and then continued: “I shall make Brooke have\nnew agreements with the tenants, and I shall draw up a rotation of\ncrops. And I’ll lay a wager we can get fine bricks out of the clay at\nBott’s corner. I must look into that: it would cheapen the repairs.\nIt’s a fine bit of work, Susan! A man without a family would be glad to\ndo it for nothing.”“Mind you don’t, though,” said his wife, lifting up her finger.“No, no; but it’s a fine thing to come to a man when he’s seen into the\nnature of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of the country\ninto good fettle, as they say, and putting men into the right way with\ntheir farming, and getting a bit of good contriving and solid building\ndone—that those who are living and those who come after will be the\nbetter for. I’d sooner have it than a fortune. I hold it the most\nhonorable work that is.” Here Caleb laid down his letters, thrust his\nfingers between the buttons of his waistcoat, and sat upright, but\npresently proceeded with some awe in his voice and moving his head\nslowly aside—“It’s a great gift of God, Susan.”“That it is, Caleb,” said his wife, with answering fervor. “And it will\nbe a blessing to your children to have had a father who did such work:\na father whose good work remains though his name may be forgotten.” She\ncould not say any more to him then about the pay."

  "content": "In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his day’s work, was\nseated in silence with his pocket-book open on his knee, while Mrs.\nGarth and Mary were at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was\nwhispering a dialogue with her doll, Mr. Farebrother came up the\norchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the\ntufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he was fond of his\nparishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to\nLydgate. He used to the full the clergyman’s privilege of disregarding\nthe Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told his mother\nthat Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town. Still,\nyou see, he spent his evenings at the Vincys’, where the matron, though\nless of a lady, presided over a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In\nthose days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect. But\nthe Vicar did heartily respect the Garths, and a visit from him was no\nsurprise to that family. Nevertheless he accounted for it even while he\nwas shaking hands, by saying, “I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I have\nsomething to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The fact is,\npoor fellow,” he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with\nhis bright glance at the three who were listening to him, “he has taken\nme into his confidence.”Mary’s heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred’s\nconfidence had gone.“We haven’t seen the lad for months,” said Caleb. “I couldn’t think\nwhat was become of him.”“He has been away on a visit,” said the Vicar, “because home was a\nlittle too hot for him, and Lydgate told his mother that the poor\nfellow must not begin to study yet. But yesterday he came and poured\nhimself out to me. I am very glad he did, because I have seen him grow\nup from a youngster of fourteen, and I am so much at home in the house\nthat the children are like nephews and nieces to me. But it is a\ndifficult case to advise upon. However, he has asked me to come and\ntell you that he is going away, and that he is so miserable about his\ndebt to you, and his inability to pay, that he can’t bear to come\nhimself even to bid you good by.”“Tell him it doesn’t signify a farthing,” said Caleb, waving his hand.\n“We’ve had the pinch and have got over it. And now I’m going to be as\nrich as a Jew.”“Which means,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, “that we are\ngoing to have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary at\nhome.”“What is the treasure-trove?” said Mr. Farebrother.“I’m going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and\nperhaps for a pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it’s all the\nsame family connection, and employment spreads like water if it’s once\nset going. It makes me very happy, Mr. Farebrother”—here Caleb threw\nback his head a little, and spread his arms on the elbows of his\nchair—“that I’ve got an opportunity again with the letting of the land,\nand carrying out a notion or two with improvements. It’s a most\nuncommonly cramping thing, as I’ve often told Susan, to sit on\nhorseback and look over the hedges at the wrong thing, and not be able\nto put your hand to it to make it right. What people do who go into\npolitics I can’t think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement\nover only a few hundred acres.”"

  "content": "It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but his\nhappiness had the effect of mountain air: his eyes were bright, and the\nwords came without effort.“I congratulate you heartily, Garth,” said the Vicar. “This is the best\nsort of news I could have had to carry to Fred Vincy, for he dwelt a\ngood deal on the injury he had done you in causing you to part with\nmoney—robbing you of it, he said—which you wanted for other purposes. I\nwish Fred were not such an idle dog; he has some very good points, and\nhis father is a little hard upon him.”“Where is he going?” said Mrs. Garth, rather coldly.“He means to try again for his degree, and he is going up to study\nbefore term. I have advised him to do that. I don’t urge him to enter\nthe Church—on the contrary. But if he will go and work so as to pass,\nthat will be some guarantee that he has energy and a will; and he is\nquite at sea; he doesn’t know what else to do. So far he will please\nhis father, and I have promised in the mean time to try and reconcile\nVincy to his son’s adopting some other line of life. Fred says frankly\nhe is not fit for a clergyman, and I would do anything I could to\nhinder a man from the fatal step of choosing the wrong profession. He\nquoted to me what you said, Miss Garth—do you remember it?” (Mr.\nFarebrother used to say “Mary” instead of “Miss Garth,” but it was part\nof his delicacy to treat her with the more deference because, according\nto Mrs. Vincy’s phrase, she worked for her bread.)Mary felt uncomfortable, but, determined to take the matter lightly,\nanswered at once, “I have said so many impertinent things to Fred—we\nare such old playfellows.”“You said, according to him, that he would be one of those ridiculous\nclergymen who help to make the whole clergy ridiculous. Really, that\nwas so cutting that I felt a little cut myself.”Caleb laughed. “She gets her tongue from you, Susan,” he said, with\nsome enjoyment.“Not its flippancy, father,” said Mary, quickly, fearing that her\nmother would be displeased. “It is rather too bad of Fred to repeat my\nflippant speeches to Mr. Farebrother.”"

  "content": "“It was certainly a hasty speech, my dear,” said Mrs. Garth, with whom\nspeaking evil of dignities was a high misdemeanor. “We should not value\nour Vicar the less because there was a ridiculous curate in the next\nparish.”“There’s something in what she says, though,” said Caleb, not disposed\nto have Mary’s sharpness undervalued. “A bad workman of any sort makes\nhis fellows mistrusted. Things hang together,” he added, looking on the\nfloor and moving his feet uneasily with a sense that words were\nscantier than thoughts.“Clearly,” said the Vicar, amused. “By being contemptible we set men’s\nminds to the tune of contempt. I certainly agree with Miss Garth’s view\nof the matter, whether I am condemned by it or not. But as to Fred\nVincy, it is only fair he should be excused a little: old\nFeatherstone’s delusive behavior did help to spoil him. There was\nsomething quite diabolical in not leaving him a farthing after all. But\nFred has the good taste not to dwell on that. And what he cares most\nabout is having offended you, Mrs. Garth; he supposes you will never\nthink well of him again.”“I have been disappointed in Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, with decision.\n“But I shall be ready to think well of him again when he gives me good\nreason to do so.”At this point Mary went out of the room, taking Letty with her."

  "content": "“Oh, we must forgive young people when they’re sorry,” said Caleb,\nwatching Mary close the door. “And as you say, Mr. Farebrother, there\nwas the very devil in that old man. Now Mary’s gone out, I must tell\nyou a thing—it’s only known to Susan and me, and you’ll not tell it\nagain. The old scoundrel wanted Mary to burn one of the wills the very\nnight he died, when she was sitting up with him by herself, and he\noffered her a sum of money that he had in the box by him if she would\ndo it. But Mary, you understand, could do no such thing—would not be\nhandling his iron chest, and so on. Now, you see, the will he wanted\nburnt was this last, so that if Mary had done what he wanted, Fred\nVincy would have had ten thousand pounds. The old man did turn to him\nat the last. That touches poor Mary close; she couldn’t help it—she was\nin the right to do what she did, but she feels, as she says, much as if\nshe had knocked down somebody’s property and broken it against her\nwill, when she was rightfully defending herself. I feel with her,\nsomehow, and if I could make any amends to the poor lad, instead of\nbearing him a grudge for the harm he did us, I should be glad to do it.\nNow, what is your opinion, sir? Susan doesn’t agree with me; she\nsays—tell what you say, Susan.”“Mary could not have acted otherwise, even if she had known what would\nbe the effect on Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, pausing from her work, and\nlooking at Mr. Farebrother.“And she was quite ignorant of it. It seems to me, a loss which falls\non another because we have done right is not to lie upon our\nconscience.”The Vicar did not answer immediately, and Caleb said, “It’s the\nfeeling. The child feels in that way, and I feel with her. You don’t\nmean your horse to tread on a dog when you’re backing out of the way;\nbut it goes through you, when it’s done.”“I am sure Mrs. Garth would agree with you there,” said Mr.\nFarebrother, who for some reason seemed more inclined to ruminate than\nto speak. “One could hardly say that the feeling you mention about Fred\nis wrong—or rather, mistaken—though no man ought to make a claim on\nsuch feeling.”“Well, well,” said Caleb, “it’s a secret. You will not tell Fred.”“Certainly not. But I shall carry the other good news—that you can\nafford the loss he caused you.”"

  "content": "Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the\norchard with Letty, went to say good-by to her. They made a pretty\npicture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the\napples on the old scant-leaved boughs—Mary in her lavender gingham and\nblack ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in her well-worn nankin\npicked up the fallen apples. If you want to know more particularly how\nMary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded\nstreet to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: she will not be among\nthose daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out\nnecks and wanton eyes, mincing as they go: let all those pass, and fix\nyour eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet\ncarriage, who looks about her, but does not suppose that anybody is\nlooking at her. If she has a broad face and square brow, well-marked\neyebrows and curly dark hair, a certain expression of amusement in her\nglance which her mouth keeps the secret of, and for the rest features\nentirely insignificant—take that ordinary but not disagreeable person\nfor a portrait of Mary Garth. If you made her smile, she would show you\nperfect little teeth; if you made her angry, she would not raise her\nvoice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever\ntasted the flavor of; if you did her a kindness, she would never forget\nit. Mary admired the keen-faced handsome little Vicar in his\nwell-brushed threadbare clothes more than any man she had had the\nopportunity of knowing. She had never heard him say a foolish thing,\nthough she knew that he did unwise ones; and perhaps foolish sayings\nwere more objectionable to her than any of Mr. Farebrother’s unwise\ndoings. At least, it was remarkable that the actual imperfections of\nthe Vicar’s clerical character never seemed to call forth the same\nscorn and dislike which she showed beforehand for the predicted\nimperfections of the clerical character sustained by Fred Vincy. These\nirregularities of judgment, I imagine, are found even in riper minds\nthan Mary Garth’s: our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and\ndemerit, which none of us ever saw. Will any one guess towards which of\nthose widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman’s\ntenderness?—the one she was most inclined to be severe on, or the\ncontrary?"

I am going straight to see him.”“No,” said Mary, shaking her head, and smiling. “If I were to say that\nhe would not be ridiculous as a clergyman, I must say that he would be\nsomething worse than ridiculous. But I am very glad to hear that he is\ngoing away to work.”“On the other hand, I am very glad to hear that _you_ are not going\naway to work. My mother, I am sure, will be all the happier if you will\ncome to see her at the vicarage: you know she is fond of having young\npeople to talk to, and she has a great deal to tell about old times.\nYou will really be doing a kindness.”“I should like it very much, if I may,” said Mary. “Everything seems\ntoo happy for me all at once. I thought it would always be part of my\nlife to long for home, and losing that grievance makes me feel rather\nempty: I suppose it served instead of sense to fill up my mind?”“May I go with you, Mary?” whispered Letty—a most inconvenient child,\nwho listened to everything. But she was made exultant by having her\nchin pinched and her cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother—an incident which\nshe narrated to her mother and father."

  "content": "As the Vicar walked to Lowick, any one watching him closely might have\nseen him twice shrug his shoulders. I think that the rare Englishmen\nwho have this gesture are never of the heavy type—for fear of any\nlumbering instance to the contrary, I will say, hardly ever; they have\nusually a fine temperament and much tolerance towards the smaller\nerrors of men (themselves inclusive). The Vicar was holding an inward\ndialogue in which he told himself that there was probably something\nmore between Fred and Mary Garth than the regard of old playfellows,\nand replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not a\ngreat deal too choice for that crude young gentleman. The rejoinder to\nthis was the first shrug. Then he laughed at himself for being likely\nto have felt jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which,\nadded he, it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not. Whereupon\nfollowed the second shrug.What could two men, so different from each other, see in this “brown\npatch,” as Mary called herself? It was certainly not her plainness that\nattracted them (and let all plain young ladies be warned against the\ndangerous encouragement given them by Society to confide in their want\nof beauty). A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very\nwonderful whole, the slow creation of long interchanging influences:\nand charm is a result of two such wholes, the one loving and the one\nloved.When Mr. and Mrs. Garth were sitting alone, Caleb said, “Susan, guess\nwhat I’m thinking of.”“The rotation of crops,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at him, above her\nknitting, “or else the back-doors of the Tipton cottages.”“No,” said Caleb, gravely; “I am thinking that I could do a great turn\nfor Fred Vincy. Christy’s gone, Alfred will be gone soon, and it will\nbe five years before Jim is ready to take to business. I shall want\nhelp, and Fred might come in and learn the nature of things and act\nunder me, and it might be the making of him into a useful man, if he\ngives up being a parson. What do you think?”“I think, there is hardly anything honest that his family would object\nto more,” said Mrs. Garth, decidedly.“What care I about their objecting?” said Caleb, with a sturdiness\nwhich he was apt to show when he had an opinion. “The lad is of age and\nmust get his bread. He has sense enough and quickness enough; he likes\nbeing on the land, and it’s my belief that he could learn business well\nif he gave his mind to it.”“But would he? His father and mother wanted him to be a fine gentleman,\nand I think he has the same sort of feeling himself. They all think us\nbeneath them. And if the proposal came from you, I am sure Mrs. Vincy\nwould say that we wanted Fred for Mary.”“Life is a poor tale, if it is to be settled by nonsense of that sort,”\nsaid Caleb, with disgust.“Yes, but there is a certain pride which is proper, Caleb.”"

There’s no sort of work,” said Caleb, with fervor, putting\nout his hand and moving it up and down to mark his emphasis, “that\ncould ever be done well, if you minded what fools say. You must have it\ninside you that your plan is right, and that plan you must follow.”“I will not oppose any plan you have set your mind on, Caleb,” said\nMrs. Garth, who was a firm woman, but knew that there were some points\non which her mild husband was yet firmer. “Still, it seems to be fixed\nthat Fred is to go back to college: will it not be better to wait and\nsee what he will choose to do after that? It is not easy to keep people\nagainst their will. And you are not yet quite sure enough of your own\nposition, or what you will want.”“Well, it may be better to wait a bit. But as to my getting plenty of\nwork for two, I’m pretty sure of that. I’ve always had my hands full\nwith scattered things, and there’s always something fresh turning up.\nWhy, only yesterday—bless me, I don’t think I told you!—it was rather\nodd that two men should have been at me on different sides to do the\nsame bit of valuing. And who do you think they were?” said Caleb,\ntaking a pinch of snuff and holding it up between his fingers, as if it\nwere a part of his exposition. He was fond of a pinch when it occurred\nto him, but he usually forgot that this indulgence was at his command.His wife held down her knitting and looked attentive.“Why, that Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, was one. But Bulstrode was\nbefore him, so I’m going to do it for Bulstrode. Whether it’s mortgage\nor purchase they’re going for, I can’t tell yet.”“Can that man be going to sell the land just left him—which he has\ntaken the name for?” said Mrs. Garth.“Deuce knows,” said Caleb, who never referred the knowledge of\ndiscreditable doings to any higher power than the deuce. “But Bulstrode\nhas long been wanting to get a handsome bit of land under his\nfingers—that I know. And it’s a difficult matter to get, in this part\nof the country.”"

I say, it would be curious if it got into Bulstrode’s\nhands after all.

The soul of\nman,” said Caleb, with the deep tone and grave shake of the head which\nalways came when he used this phrase—“The soul of man, when it gets\nfairly rotten, will bear you all sorts of poisonous toad-stools, and no\neye can see whence came the seed thereof.”It was one of Caleb’s quaintnesses, that in his difficulty of finding\nspeech for his thought, he caught, as it were, snatches of diction\nwhich he associated with various points of view or states of mind; and\nwhenever he had a feeling of awe, he was haunted by a sense of Biblical\nphraseology, though he could hardly have given a strict quotation.CHAPTER XLI.By swaggering could I never thrive,\nFor the rain it raineth every day.\n—_Twelfth Night_.The transactions referred to by Caleb Garth as having gone forward\nbetween Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Joshua Rigg Featherstone concerning the\nland attached to Stone Court, had occasioned the interchange of a\nletter or two between these personages."

Such conditions are often\nminutely represented in our petty lifetimes. As the stone which has\nbeen kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links\nof effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at\nlast fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink\nand paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at\nlast be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge\nenough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe.

  "content": "But Mr. Rigg Featherstone’s low characteristics were all of the sober,\nwater-drinking kind. From the earliest to the latest hour of the day he\nwas always as sleek, neat, and cool as the frog he resembled, and old\nPeter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more calculating,\nand far more imperturbable, than himself. I will add that his\nfinger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and that he meant to marry\na well-educated young lady (as yet unspecified) whose person was good,\nand whose connections, in a solid middle-class way, were undeniable.\nThus his nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen;\nthough his ambition had been educated only by the opportunities of a\nclerk and accountant in the smaller commercial houses of a seaport. He\nthought the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people, and they in\ntheir turn regarded his “bringing up” in a seaport town as an\nexaggeration of the monstrosity that their brother Peter, and still\nmore Peter’s property, should have had such belongings.The garden and gravel approach, as seen from the two windows of the\nwainscoted parlor at Stone Court, were never in better trim than now,\nwhen Mr. Rigg Featherstone stood, with his hands behind him, looking\nout on these grounds as their master. But it seemed doubtful whether he\nlooked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning his back to a\nperson who stood in the middle of the room, with his legs considerably\napart and his hands in his trouser-pockets: a person in all respects a\ncontrast to the sleek and cool Rigg. He was a man obviously on the way\ntowards sixty, very florid and hairy, with much gray in his bushy\nwhiskers and thick curly hair, a stoutish body which showed to\ndisadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of his clothes, and the air of\na swaggerer, who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of\nfireworks, regarding his own remarks on any other person’s performance\nas likely to be more interesting than the performance itself.His name was John Raffles, and he sometimes wrote jocosely W.A.G. after\nhis signature, observing when he did so, that he was once taught by\nLeonard Lamb of Finsbury who wrote B.A. after his name, and that he,\nRaffles, originated the witticism of calling that celebrated principal\nBa-Lamb. Such were the appearance and mental flavor of Mr. Raffles,\nboth of which seemed to have a stale odor of travellers’ rooms in the\ncommercial hotels of that period.“Come, now, Josh,” he was saying, in a full rumbling tone, “look at it\nin this light: here is your poor mother going into the vale of years,\nand you could afford something handsome now to make her comfortable.”“Not while you live. Nothing would make her comfortable while you\nlive,” returned Rigg, in his cool high voice. “What I give her, you’ll\ntake.”"

The tobacco trade is growing. I should\ncut my own nose off in not doing the best I could at it. I should stick\nto it like a flea to a fleece for my own sake. I should always be on\nthe spot. And nothing would make your poor mother so happy. I’ve pretty\nwell done with my wild oats—turned fifty-five. I want to settle down in\nmy chimney-corner. And if I once buckled to the tobacco trade, I could\nbring an amount of brains and experience to bear on it that would not\nbe found elsewhere in a hurry. I don’t want to be bothering you one\ntime after another, but to get things once for all into the right\nchannel. Consider that, Josh—as between man and man—and with your poor\nmother to be made easy for her life. I was always fond of the old\nwoman, by Jove!”“Have you done?” said Mr. Rigg, quietly, without looking away from the\nwindow.“Yes, _I_’ve done,” said Raffles, taking hold of his hat which stood\nbefore him on the table, and giving it a sort of oratorical push.“Then just listen to me. The more you say anything, the less I shall\nbelieve it. The more you want me to do a thing, the more reason I shall\nhave for never doing it. Do you think I mean to forget your kicking me\nwhen I was a lad, and eating all the best victual away from me and my\nmother? Do you think I forget your always coming home to sell and\npocket everything, and going off again leaving us in the lurch? I\nshould be glad to see you whipped at the cart-tail. My mother was a\nfool to you: she’d no right to give me a father-in-law, and she’s been\npunished for it. She shall have her weekly allowance paid and no more:\nand that shall be stopped if you dare to come on to these premises\nagain, or to come into this country after me again. The next time you\nshow yourself inside the gates here, you shall be driven off with the\ndogs and the wagoner’s whip.”As Rigg pronounced the last words he turned round and looked at Raffles\nwith his prominent frozen eyes. The contrast was as striking as it\ncould have been eighteen years before, when Rigg was a most unengaging\nkickable boy, and Raffles was the rather thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms\nand back-parlors. But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg, and\nauditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles\nwould retire with the air of a defeated dog. Not at all. He made a\ngrimace which was habitual with him whenever he was “out” in a game;\nthen subsided into a laugh, and drew a brandy-flask from his pocket.“Come, Josh,” he said, in a cajoling tone, “give us a spoonful of\nbrandy, and a sovereign to pay the way back, and I’ll go. Honor bright!\nI’ll go like a bullet, _by_ Jove!”"

I don’t own you any more than if I saw a\ncrow; and if you want to own me you’ll get nothing by it but a\ncharacter for being what you are—a spiteful, brassy, bullying rogue.”“That’s a pity, now, Josh,” said Raffles, affecting to scratch his head\nand wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed. “I’m very fond\nof you; _by_ Jove, I am! There’s nothing I like better than plaguing\nyou—you’re so like your mother, and I must do without it. But the\nbrandy and the sovereign’s a bargain.”He jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau\nwith his keys. But Raffles had reminded himself by his movement with\nthe flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather\ncovering, and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within\nthe fender, he took it up and shoved it under the leather so as to make\nthe glass firm.By that time Rigg came forward with a brandy-bottle, filled the flask,\nand handed Raffles a sovereign, neither looking at him nor speaking to\nhim. After locking up the bureau again, he walked to the window and\ngazed out as impassibly as he had done at the beginning of the\ninterview, while Raffles took a small allowance from the flask, screwed\nit up, and deposited it in his side-pocket, with provoking slowness,\nmaking a grimace at his stepson’s back.“Farewell, Josh—and if forever!” said Raffles, turning back his head as\nhe opened the door.Rigg saw him leave the grounds and enter the lane. The gray day had\nturned to a light drizzling rain, which freshened the hedgerows and the\ngrassy borders of the by-roads, and hastened the laborers who were\nloading the last shocks of corn. Raffles, walking with the uneasy gait\nof a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot,\nlooked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if he\nhad been a baboon escaped from a menagerie. But there were none to\nstare at him except the long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of\nhis appearance except the little water-rats which rustled away at his\napproach."

Mr.\nRaffles on most occasions kept up the sense of having been educated at\nan academy, and being able, if he chose, to pass well everywhere;\nindeed, there was not one of his fellow-men whom he did not feel\nhimself in a position to ridicule and torment, confident of the\nentertainment which he thus gave to all the rest of the company.He played this part now with as much spirit as if his journey had been\nentirely successful, resorting at frequent intervals to his flask. The\npaper with which he had wedged it was a letter signed _Nicholas\nBulstrode_, but Raffles was not likely to disturb it from its present\nuseful position.CHAPTER XLII.How much, methinks, I could despise this man\nWere I not bound in charity against it!\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Henry VIII_.One of the professional calls made by Lydgate soon after his return\nfrom his wedding-journey was to Lowick Manor, in consequence of a\nletter which had requested him to fix a time for his visit.Mr. Casaubon had never put any question concerning the nature of his\nillness to Lydgate, nor had he even to Dorothea betrayed any anxiety as\nto how far it might be likely to cut short his labors or his life. On\nthis point, as on all others, he shrank from pity; and if the suspicion\nof being pitied for anything in his lot surmised or known in spite of\nhimself was embittering, the idea of calling forth a show of compassion\nby frankly admitting an alarm or a sorrow was necessarily intolerable\nto him. Every proud mind knows something of this experience, and\nperhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough\nto make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of\nexalting."

  "content": "But Mr. Casaubon was now brooding over something through which the\nquestion of his health and life haunted his silence with a more\nharassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of his\nauthorship. It is true that this last might be called his central\nambition; but there are some kinds of authorship in which by far the\nlargest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated in the\nconsciousness of the author—one knows of the river by a few streaks\namid a long-gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud. That was the way\nwith Mr. Casaubon’s hard intellectual labors. Their most characteristic\nresult was not the “Key to all Mythologies,” but a morbid consciousness\nthat others did not give him the place which he had not demonstrably\nmerited—a perpetual suspicious conjecture that the views entertained of\nhim were not to his advantage—a melancholy absence of passion in his\nefforts at achievement, and a passionate resistance to the confession\nthat he had achieved nothing.Thus his intellectual ambition which seemed to others to have absorbed\nand dried him, was really no security against wounds, least of all\nagainst those which came from Dorothea. And he had begun now to frame\npossibilities for the future which were somehow more embittering to him\nthan anything his mind had dwelt on before.Against certain facts he was helpless: against Will Ladislaw’s\nexistence, his defiant stay in the neighborhood of Lowick, and his\nflippant state of mind with regard to the possessors of authentic,\nwell-stamped erudition: against Dorothea’s nature, always taking on\nsome new shape of ardent activity, and even in submission and silence\ncovering fervid reasons which it was an irritation to think of: against\ncertain notions and likings which had taken possession of her mind in\nrelation to subjects that he could not possibly discuss with her. There\nwas no denying that Dorothea was as virtuous and lovely a young lady as\nhe could have obtained for a wife; but a young lady turned out to be\nsomething more troublesome than he had conceived. She nursed him, she\nread to him, she anticipated his wants, and was solicitous about his\nfeelings; but there had entered into the husband’s mind the certainty\nthat she judged him, and that her wifely devotedness was like a\npenitential expiation of unbelieving thoughts—was accompanied with a\npower of comparison by which himself and his doings were seen too\nluminously as a part of things in general. His discontent passed\nvapor-like through all her gentle loving manifestations, and clung to\nthat inappreciative world which she had only brought nearer to him."

  "content": "Poor Mr. Casaubon! This suffering was the harder to bear because it\nseemed like a betrayal: the young creature who had worshipped him with\nperfect trust had quickly turned into the critical wife; and early\ninstances of criticism and resentment had made an impression which no\ntenderness and submission afterwards could remove. To his suspicious\ninterpretation Dorothea’s silence now was a suppressed rebellion; a\nremark from her which he had not in any way anticipated was an\nassertion of conscious superiority; her gentle answers had an\nirritating cautiousness in them; and when she acquiesced it was a\nself-approved effort of forbearance. The tenacity with which he strove\nto hide this inward drama made it the more vivid for him; as we hear\nwith the more keenness what we wish others not to hear.Instead of wondering at this result of misery in Mr. Casaubon, I think\nit quite ordinary. Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot\nout the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the\nblot? I know no speck so troublesome as self. And who, if Mr. Casaubon\nhad chosen to expound his discontents—his suspicions that he was not\nany longer adored without criticism—could have denied that they were\nfounded on good reasons? On the contrary, there was a strong reason to\nbe added, which he had not himself taken explicitly into\naccount—namely, that he was not unmixedly adorable. He suspected this,\nhowever, as he suspected other things, without confessing it, and like\nthe rest of us, felt how soothing it would have been to have a\ncompanion who would never find it out."

  "content": "This sore susceptibility in relation to Dorothea was thoroughly\nprepared before Will Ladislaw had returned to Lowick, and what had\noccurred since then had brought Mr. Casaubon’s power of suspicious\nconstruction into exasperated activity. To all the facts which he knew,\nhe added imaginary facts both present and future which became more real\nto him than those because they called up a stronger dislike, a more\npredominating bitterness. Suspicion and jealousy of Will Ladislaw’s\nintentions, suspicion and jealousy of Dorothea’s impressions, were\nconstantly at their weaving work. It would be quite unjust to him to\nsuppose that he could have entered into any coarse misinterpretation of\nDorothea: his own habits of mind and conduct, quite as much as the open\nelevation of her nature, saved him from any such mistake. What he was\njealous of was her opinion, the sway that might be given to her ardent\nmind in its judgments, and the future possibilities to which these\nmight lead her. As to Will, though until his last defiant letter he had\nnothing definite which he would choose formally to allege against him,\nhe felt himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any\ndesign which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined\nimpulsiveness. He was quite sure that Dorothea was the cause of Will’s\nreturn from Rome, and his determination to settle in the neighborhood;\nand he was penetrating enough to imagine that Dorothea had innocently\nencouraged this course. It was as clear as possible that she was ready\nto be attached to Will and to be pliant to his suggestions: they had\nnever had a _tête-à-tête_ without her bringing away from it some new\ntroublesome impression, and the last interview that Mr. Casaubon was\naware of (Dorothea, on returning from Freshitt Hall, had for the first\ntime been silent about having seen Will) had led to a scene which\nroused an angrier feeling against them both than he had ever known\nbefore. Dorothea’s outpouring of her notions about money, in the\ndarkness of the night, had done nothing but bring a mixture of more\nodious foreboding into her husband’s mind."

He was certainly much revived; he had recovered all his usual\npower of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there\nmight still be twenty years of achievement before him, which would\njustify the thirty years of preparation. That prospect was made the\nsweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp &\nCompany; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his taper among the\ntombs of the past, those modern figures came athwart the dim light, and\ninterrupted his diligent exploration. To convince Carp of his mistake,\nso that he would have to eat his own words with a good deal of\nindigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship,\nwhich the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all\neternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus,\nthe prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter\nsavors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less\nsurprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other\npersons, when he himself should have entered into glory, had not a\npotently sweetening effect. If the truth should be that some\nundermining disease was at work within him, there might be large\nopportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone; and if\none of those people should be Will Ladislaw, Mr. Casaubon objected so\nstrongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his\ndisembodied existence."

  "content": "This is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the\ncase. The human soul moves in many channels, and Mr. Casaubon, we know,\nhad a sense of rectitude and an honorable pride in satisfying the\nrequirements of honor, which compelled him to find other reasons for\nhis conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness. The way in which\nMr. Casaubon put the case was this:—“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had\nto care for her well-being in case of my death. But well-being is not\nto be secured by ample, independent possession of property; on the\ncontrary, occasions might arise in which such possession might expose\nher to the more danger. She is ready prey to any man who knows how to\nplay adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her Quixotic\nenthusiasm; and a man stands by with that very intention in his mind—a\nman with no other principle than transient caprice, and who has a\npersonal animosity towards me—I am sure of it—an animosity which is fed\nby the consciousness of his ingratitude, and which he has constantly\nvented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had heard it.\nEven if I live I shall not be without uneasiness as to what he may\nattempt through indirect influence. This man has gained Dorothea’s ear:\nhe has fascinated her attention; he has evidently tried to impress her\nmind with the notion that he has claims beyond anything I have done for\nhim. If I die—and he is waiting here on the watch for that—he will\npersuade her to marry him. That would be calamity for her and success\nfor him. _She_ would not think it calamity: he would make her believe\nanything; she has a tendency to immoderate attachment which she\ninwardly reproaches me for not responding to, and already her mind is\noccupied with his fortunes. He thinks of an easy conquest and of\nentering into my nest. That I will hinder! Such a marriage would be\nfatal to Dorothea. Has he ever persisted in anything except from\ncontradiction? In knowledge he has always tried to be showy at small\ncost. In religion he could be, as long as it suited him, the facile\necho of Dorothea’s vagaries. When was sciolism ever dissociated from\nlaxity? I utterly distrust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to\nthe utmost the fulfilment of his designs.”"
