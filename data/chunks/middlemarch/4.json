  "content": "Lydgate could not be long in Middlemarch without having that agreeable\nvision, or even without making the acquaintance of the Vincy family;\nfor though Mr. Peacock, whose practice he had paid something to enter\non, had not been their doctor (Mrs. Vincy not liking the lowering\nsystem adopted by him), he had many patients among their connections\nand acquaintances. For who of any consequence in Middlemarch was not\nconnected or at least acquainted with the Vincys? They were old\nmanufacturers, and had kept a good house for three generations, in\nwhich there had naturally been much intermarrying with neighbors more\nor less decidedly genteel. Mr. Vincy’s sister had made a wealthy match\nin accepting Mr. Bulstrode, who, however, as a man not born in the\ntown, and altogether of dimly known origin, was considered to have done\nwell in uniting himself with a real Middlemarch family; on the other\nhand, Mr. Vincy had descended a little, having taken an innkeeper’s\ndaughter. But on this side too there was a cheering sense of money; for\nMrs. Vincy’s sister had been second wife to rich old Mr. Featherstone,\nand had died childless years ago, so that her nephews and nieces might\nbe supposed to touch the affections of the widower. And it happened\nthat Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Featherstone, two of Peacock’s most\nimportant patients, had, from different causes, given an especially\ngood reception to his successor, who had raised some partisanship as\nwell as discussion. Mr. Wrench, medical attendant to the Vincy family,\nvery early had grounds for thinking lightly of Lydgate’s professional\ndiscretion, and there was no report about him which was not retailed at\nthe Vincys’, where visitors were frequent. Mr. Vincy was more inclined\nto general good-fellowship than to taking sides, but there was no need\nfor him to be hasty in making any new man acquaintance. Rosamond\nsilently wished that her father would invite Mr. Lydgate. She was tired\nof the faces and figures she had always been used to—the various\nirregular profiles and gaits and turns of phrase distinguishing those\nMiddlemarch young men whom she had known as boys. She had been at\nschool with girls of higher position, whose brothers, she felt sure, it\nwould have been possible for her to be more interested in, than in\nthese inevitable Middlemarch companions. But she would not have chosen\nto mention her wish to her father; and he, for his part, was in no\nhurry on the subject. An alderman about to be mayor must by-and-by\nenlarge his dinner-parties, but at present there were plenty of guests\nat his well-spread table."

  "content": "That table often remained covered with the relics of the family\nbreakfast long after Mr. Vincy had gone with his second son to the\nwarehouse, and when Miss Morgan was already far on in morning lessons\nwith the younger girls in the schoolroom. It awaited the family\nlaggard, who found any sort of inconvenience (to others) less\ndisagreeable than getting up when he was called. This was the case one\nmorning of the October in which we have lately seen Mr. Casaubon\nvisiting the Grange; and though the room was a little overheated with\nthe fire, which had sent the spaniel panting to a remote corner,\nRosamond, for some reason, continued to sit at her embroidery longer\nthan usual, now and then giving herself a little shake, and laying her\nwork on her knee to contemplate it with an air of hesitating weariness.\nHer mamma, who had returned from an excursion to the kitchen, sat on\nthe other side of the small work-table with an air of more entire\nplacidity, until, the clock again giving notice that it was going to\nstrike, she looked up from the lace-mending which was occupying her\nplump fingers and rang the bell.“Knock at Mr. Fred’s door again, Pritchard, and tell him it has struck\nhalf-past ten.”This was said without any change in the radiant good-humor of Mrs.\nVincy’s face, in which forty-five years had delved neither angles nor\nparallels; and pushing back her pink capstrings, she let her work rest\non her lap, while she looked admiringly at her daughter.“Mamma,” said Rosamond, “when Fred comes down I wish you would not let\nhim have red herrings. I cannot bear the smell of them all over the\nhouse at this hour of the morning.”“Oh, my dear, you are so hard on your brothers! It is the only fault I\nhave to find with you. You are the sweetest temper in the world, but\nyou are so tetchy with your brothers.”“Not tetchy, mamma: you never hear me speak in an unladylike way.”“Well, but you want to deny them things.”“Brothers are so unpleasant.”"

  "content": "“Oh, my dear, you must allow for young men. Be thankful if they have\ngood hearts. A woman must learn to put up with little things. You will\nbe married some day.”“Not to any one who is like Fred.”“Don’t decry your own brother, my dear. Few young men have less against\nthem, although he couldn’t take his degree—I’m sure I can’t understand\nwhy, for he seems to me most clever. And you know yourself he was\nthought equal to the best society at college. So particular as you are,\nmy dear, I wonder you are not glad to have such a gentlemanly young man\nfor a brother. You are always finding fault with Bob because he is not\nFred.”“Oh no, mamma, only because he is Bob.”“Well, my dear, you will not find any Middlemarch young man who has not\nsomething against him.”“But”—here Rosamond’s face broke into a smile which suddenly revealed\ntwo dimples. She herself thought unfavorably of these dimples and\nsmiled little in general society. “But I shall not marry any\nMiddlemarch young man.”“So it seems, my love, for you have as good as refused the pick of\nthem; and if there’s better to be had, I’m sure there’s no girl better\ndeserves it.”“Excuse me, mamma—I wish you would not say, ‘the pick of them.’”“Why, what else are they?”“I mean, mamma, it is rather a vulgar expression.”“Very likely, my dear; I never was a good speaker. What should I say?”“The best of them.”“Why, that seems just as plain and common. If I had had time to think,\nI should have said, ‘the most superior young men.’ But with your\neducation you must know.”“What must Rosy know, mother?” said Mr. Fred, who had slid in\nunobserved through the half-open door while the ladies were bending\nover their work, and now going up to the fire stood with his back\ntowards it, warming the soles of his slippers.“Whether it’s right to say ‘superior young men,’” said Mrs. Vincy,\nringing the bell.“Oh, there are so many superior teas and sugars now. Superior is\ngetting to be shopkeepers’ slang.”“Are you beginning to dislike slang, then?” said Rosamond, with mild\ngravity.“Only the wrong sort. All choice of words is slang. It marks a class.”“There is correct English: that is not slang.”"

  "content": "“I beg your pardon: correct English is the slang of prigs who write\nhistory and essays. And the strongest slang of all is the slang of\npoets.”“You will say anything, Fred, to gain your point.”“Well, tell me whether it is slang or poetry to call an ox a\n_leg-plaiter_.”“Of course you can call it poetry if you like.”“Aha, Miss Rosy, you don’t know Homer from slang. I shall invent a new\ngame; I shall write bits of slang and poetry on slips, and give them to\nyou to separate.”“Dear me, how amusing it is to hear young people talk!” said Mrs.\nVincy, with cheerful admiration.“Have you got nothing else for my breakfast, Pritchard?” said Fred, to\nthe servant who brought in coffee and buttered toast; while he walked\nround the table surveying the ham, potted beef, and other cold\nremnants, with an air of silent rejection, and polite forbearance from\nsigns of disgust.“Should you like eggs, sir?”“Eggs, no! Bring me a grilled bone.”“Really, Fred,” said Rosamond, when the servant had left the room, “if\nyou must have hot things for breakfast, I wish you would come down\nearlier. You can get up at six o’clock to go out hunting; I cannot\nunderstand why you find it so difficult to get up on other mornings.”“That is your want of understanding, Rosy. I can get up to go hunting\nbecause I like it.”“What would you think of me if I came down two hours after every one\nelse and ordered grilled bone?”“I should think you were an uncommonly fast young lady,” said Fred,\neating his toast with the utmost composure.“I cannot see why brothers are to make themselves disagreeable, any\nmore than sisters.”“I don’t make myself disagreeable; it is you who find me so.\nDisagreeable is a word that describes your feelings and not my\nactions.”“I think it describes the smell of grilled bone.”“Not at all. It describes a sensation in your little nose associated\nwith certain finicking notions which are the classics of Mrs. Lemon’s\nschool. Look at my mother; you don’t see her objecting to everything\nexcept what she does herself. She is my notion of a pleasant woman.”"

  "content": "“Bless you both, my dears, and don’t quarrel,” said Mrs. Vincy, with\nmotherly cordiality. “Come, Fred, tell us all about the new doctor. How\nis your uncle pleased with him?”“Pretty well, I think. He asks Lydgate all sorts of questions and then\nscrews up his face while he hears the answers, as if they were pinching\nhis toes. That’s his way. Ah, here comes my grilled bone.”“But how came you to stay out so late, my dear? You only said you were\ngoing to your uncle’s.”“Oh, I dined at Plymdale’s. We had whist. Lydgate was there too.”“And what do you think of him? He is very gentlemanly, I suppose. They\nsay he is of excellent family—his relations quite county people.”“Yes,” said Fred. “There was a Lydgate at John’s who spent no end of\nmoney. I find this man is a second cousin of his. But rich men may have\nvery poor devils for second cousins.”“It always makes a difference, though, to be of good family,” said\nRosamond, with a tone of decision which showed that she had thought on\nthis subject. Rosamond felt that she might have been happier if she had\nnot been the daughter of a Middlemarch manufacturer. She disliked\nanything which reminded her that her mother’s father had been an\ninnkeeper. Certainly any one remembering the fact might think that Mrs.\nVincy had the air of a very handsome good-humored landlady, accustomed\nto the most capricious orders of gentlemen.“I thought it was odd his name was Tertius,” said the bright-faced\nmatron, “but of course it’s a name in the family. But now, tell us\nexactly what sort of man he is.”“Oh, tallish, dark, clever—talks well—rather a prig, I think.”“I never can make out what you mean by a prig,” said Rosamond.“A fellow who wants to show that he has opinions.”“Why, my dear, doctors must have opinions,” said Mrs. Vincy. “What are\nthey there for else?”“Yes, mother, the opinions they are paid for. But a prig is a fellow\nwho is always making you a present of his opinions.”“I suppose Mary Garth admires Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, not without\na touch of innuendo."

  "content": "“Really, I can’t say.” said Fred, rather glumly, as he left the table,\nand taking up a novel which he had brought down with him, threw himself\ninto an arm-chair. “If you are jealous of her, go oftener to Stone\nCourt yourself and eclipse her.”“I wish you would not be so vulgar, Fred. If you have finished, pray\nring the bell.”“It is true, though—what your brother says, Rosamond,” Mrs. Vincy\nbegan, when the servant had cleared the table. “It is a thousand pities\nyou haven’t patience to go and see your uncle more, so proud of you as\nhe is, and wanted you to live with him. There’s no knowing what he\nmight have done for you as well as for Fred. God knows, I’m fond of\nhaving you at home with me, but I can part with my children for their\ngood. And now it stands to reason that your uncle Featherstone will do\nsomething for Mary Garth.”“Mary Garth can bear being at Stone Court, because she likes that\nbetter than being a governess,” said Rosamond, folding up her work. “I\nwould rather not have anything left to me if I must earn it by enduring\nmuch of my uncle’s cough and his ugly relations.”“He can’t be long for this world, my dear; I wouldn’t hasten his end,\nbut what with asthma and that inward complaint, let us hope there is\nsomething better for him in another. And I have no ill-will towards\nMary Garth, but there’s justice to be thought of. And Mr.\nFeatherstone’s first wife brought him no money, as my sister did. Her\nnieces and nephews can’t have so much claim as my sister’s. And I must\nsay I think Mary Garth a dreadful plain girl—more fit for a governess.”“Every one would not agree with you there, mother,” said Fred, who\nseemed to be able to read and listen too.“Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, wheeling skilfully, “if she _had_\nsome fortune left her,—a man marries his wife’s relations, and the\nGarths are so poor, and live in such a small way. But I shall leave you\nto your studies, my dear; for I must go and do some shopping.”“Fred’s studies are not very deep,” said Rosamond, rising with her\nmamma, “he is only reading a novel.”"

  "content": "“Well, well, by-and-by he’ll go to his Latin and things,” said Mrs.\nVincy, soothingly, stroking her son’s head. “There’s a fire in the\nsmoking-room on purpose. It’s your father’s wish, you know—Fred, my\ndear—and I always tell him you will be good, and go to college again to\ntake your degree.”Fred drew his mother’s hand down to his lips, but said nothing.“I suppose you are not going out riding to-day?” said Rosamond,\nlingering a little after her mamma was gone.“No; why?”“Papa says I may have the chestnut to ride now.”“You can go with me to-morrow, if you like. Only I am going to Stone\nCourt, remember.”“I want to ride so much, it is indifferent to me where we go.” Rosamond\nreally wished to go to Stone Court, of all other places.“Oh, I say, Rosy,” said Fred, as she was passing out of the room, “if\nyou are going to the piano, let me come and play some airs with you.”“Pray do not ask me this morning.”“Why not this morning?”“Really, Fred, I wish you would leave off playing the flute. A man\nlooks very silly playing the flute. And you play so out of tune.”“When next any one makes love to you, Miss Rosamond, I will tell him\nhow obliging you are.”“Why should you expect me to oblige you by hearing you play the flute,\nany more than I should expect you to oblige me by not playing it?”“And why should you expect me to take you out riding?”This question led to an adjustment, for Rosamond had set her mind on\nthat particular ride.So Fred was gratified with nearly an hour’s practice of “Ar hyd y nos,”\n“Ye banks and braes,” and other favorite airs from his “Instructor on\nthe Flute;” a wheezy performance, into which he threw much ambition and\nan irrepressible hopefulness.CHAPTER XII.He had more tow on his distaffe\nThan Gerveis knew.\n—CHAUCER."

  "content": "The ride to Stone Court, which Fred and Rosamond took the next morning,\nlay through a pretty bit of midland landscape, almost all meadows and\npastures, with hedgerows still allowed to grow in bushy beauty and to\nspread out coral fruit for the birds. Little details gave each field a\nparticular physiognomy, dear to the eyes that have looked on them from\nchildhood: the pool in the corner where the grasses were dank and trees\nleaned whisperingly; the great oak shadowing a bare place in\nmid-pasture; the high bank where the ash-trees grew; the sudden slope\nof the old marl-pit making a red background for the burdock; the\nhuddled roofs and ricks of the homestead without a traceable way of\napproach; the gray gate and fences against the depths of the bordering\nwood; and the stray hovel, its old, old thatch full of mossy hills and\nvalleys with wondrous modulations of light and shadow such as we travel\nfar to see in later life, and see larger, but not more beautiful. These\nare the things that make the gamut of joy in landscape to midland-bred\nsouls—the things they toddled among, or perhaps learned by heart\nstanding between their father’s knees while he drove leisurely.But the road, even the byroad, was excellent; for Lowick, as we have\nseen, was not a parish of muddy lanes and poor tenants; and it was into\nLowick parish that Fred and Rosamond entered after a couple of miles’\nriding. Another mile would bring them to Stone Court, and at the end of\nthe first half, the house was already visible, looking as if it had\nbeen arrested in its growth toward a stone mansion by an unexpected\nbudding of farm-buildings on its left flank, which had hindered it from\nbecoming anything more than the substantial dwelling of a gentleman\nfarmer. It was not the less agreeable an object in the distance for the\ncluster of pinnacled corn-ricks which balanced the fine row of walnuts\non the right.Presently it was possible to discern something that might be a gig on\nthe circular drive before the front door.“Dear me,” said Rosamond, “I hope none of my uncle’s horrible relations\nare there.”“They are, though. That is Mrs. Waule’s gig—the last yellow gig left, I\nshould think. When I see Mrs. Waule in it, I understand how yellow can\nhave been worn for mourning. That gig seems to me more funereal than a\nhearse. But then Mrs. Waule always has black crape on. How does she\nmanage it, Rosy? Her friends can’t always be dying.”“I don’t know at all. And she is not in the least evangelical,” said\nRosamond, reflectively, as if that religious point of view would have\nfully accounted for perpetual crape. “And, not poor,” she added, after\na moment’s pause.“No, by George! They are as rich as Jews, those Waules and\nFeatherstones; I mean, for people like them, who don’t want to spend\nanything. And yet they hang about my uncle like vultures, and are\nafraid of a farthing going away from their side of the family. But I\nbelieve he hates them all.”"

  "content": "The Mrs. Waule who was so far from being admirable in the eyes of these\ndistant connections, had happened to say this very morning (not at all\nwith a defiant air, but in a low, muffled, neutral tone, as of a voice\nheard through cotton wool) that she did not wish “to enjoy their good\nopinion.” She was seated, as she observed, on her own brother’s hearth,\nand had been Jane Featherstone five-and-twenty years before she had\nbeen Jane Waule, which entitled her to speak when her own brother’s\nname had been made free with by those who had no right to it.“What are you driving at there?” said Mr. Featherstone, holding his\nstick between his knees and settling his wig, while he gave her a\nmomentary sharp glance, which seemed to react on him like a draught of\ncold air and set him coughing.Mrs. Waule had to defer her answer till he was quiet again, till Mary\nGarth had supplied him with fresh syrup, and he had begun to rub the\ngold knob of his stick, looking bitterly at the fire. It was a bright\nfire, but it made no difference to the chill-looking purplish tint of\nMrs. Waule’s face, which was as neutral as her voice; having mere\nchinks for eyes, and lips that hardly moved in speaking.“The doctors can’t master that cough, brother. It’s just like what I\nhave; for I’m your own sister, constitution and everything. But, as I\nwas saying, it’s a pity Mrs. Vincy’s family can’t be better conducted.”“Tchah! you said nothing o’ the sort. You said somebody had made free\nwith my name.”“And no more than can be proved, if what everybody says is true. My\nbrother Solomon tells me it’s the talk up and down in Middlemarch how\nunsteady young Vincy is, and has been forever gambling at billiards\nsince home he came.”“Nonsense! What’s a game at billiards? It’s a good gentlemanly game;\nand young Vincy is not a clodhopper. If your son John took to\nbilliards, now, he’d make a fool of himself.”“Your nephew John never took to billiards or any other game, brother,\nand is far from losing hundreds of pounds, which, if what everybody\nsays is true, must be found somewhere else than out of Mr. Vincy the\nfather’s pocket. For they say he’s been losing money for years, though\nnobody would think so, to see him go coursing and keeping open house as\nthey do. And I’ve heard say Mr. Bulstrode condemns Mrs. Vincy beyond\nanything for her flightiness, and spoiling her children so.”“What’s Bulstrode to me? I don’t bank with him.”"

  "content": "“Well, Mrs. Bulstrode is Mr. Vincy’s own sister, and they do say that\nMr. Vincy mostly trades on the Bank money; and you may see yourself,\nbrother, when a woman past forty has pink strings always flying, and\nthat light way of laughing at everything, it’s very unbecoming. But\nindulging your children is one thing, and finding money to pay their\ndebts is another. And it’s openly said that young Vincy has raised\nmoney on his expectations. I don’t say what expectations. Miss Garth\nhears me, and is welcome to tell again. I know young people hang\ntogether.”“No, thank you, Mrs. Waule,” said Mary Garth. “I dislike hearing\nscandal too much to wish to repeat it.”Mr. Featherstone rubbed the knob of his stick and made a brief\nconvulsive show of laughter, which had much the same genuineness as an\nold whist-player’s chuckle over a bad hand. Still looking at the fire,\nhe said—“And who pretends to say Fred Vincy hasn’t got expectations? Such a\nfine, spirited fellow is like enough to have ’em.”There was a slight pause before Mrs. Waule replied, and when she did\nso, her voice seemed to be slightly moistened with tears, though her\nface was still dry.“Whether or no, brother, it is naturally painful to me and my brother\nSolomon to hear your name made free with, and your complaint being such\nas may carry you off sudden, and people who are no more Featherstones\nthan the Merry-Andrew at the fair, openly reckoning on your property\ncoming to _them_. And me your own sister, and Solomon your own brother!\nAnd if that’s to be it, what has it pleased the Almighty to make\nfamilies for?” Here Mrs. Waule’s tears fell, but with moderation.“Come, out with it, Jane!” said Mr. Featherstone, looking at her. “You\nmean to say, Fred Vincy has been getting somebody to advance him money\non what he says he knows about my will, eh?”“I never said so, brother” (Mrs. Waule’s voice had again become dry and\nunshaken). “It was told me by my brother Solomon last night when he\ncalled coming from market to give me advice about the old wheat, me\nbeing a widow, and my son John only three-and-twenty, though steady\nbeyond anything. And he had it from most undeniable authority, and not\none, but many.”“Stuff and nonsense! I don’t believe a word of it. It’s all a got-up\nstory. Go to the window, missy; I thought I heard a horse. See if the\ndoctor’s coming.”"

But Solomon makes it no secret what he means to do.”“The more fool he!” said Mr. Featherstone, with some difficulty;\nbreaking into a severe fit of coughing that required Mary Garth to\nstand near him, so that she did not find out whose horses they were\nwhich presently paused stamping on the gravel before the door.Before Mr. Featherstone’s cough was quiet, Rosamond entered, bearing up\nher riding-habit with much grace. She bowed ceremoniously to Mrs.\nWaule, who said stiffly, “How do you do, miss?” smiled and nodded\nsilently to Mary, and remained standing till the coughing should cease,\nand allow her uncle to notice her.“Heyday, miss!” he said at last, “you have a fine color. Where’s Fred?”“Seeing about the horses. He will be in presently.”“Sit down, sit down. Mrs. Waule, you’d better go.”Even those neighbors who had called Peter Featherstone an old fox, had\nnever accused him of being insincerely polite, and his sister was quite\nused to the peculiar absence of ceremony with which he marked his sense\nof blood-relationship. Indeed, she herself was accustomed to think that\nentire freedom from the necessity of behaving agreeably was included in\nthe Almighty’s intentions about families. She rose slowly without any\nsign of resentment, and said in her usual muffled monotone, “Brother, I\nhope the new doctor will be able to do something for you. Solomon says\nthere’s great talk of his cleverness. I’m sure it’s my wish you should\nbe spared. And there’s none more ready to nurse you than your own\nsister and your own nieces, if you’d only say the word. There’s\nRebecca, and Joanna, and Elizabeth, you know.”"

There never was any beauty in\nthe women of our family; but the Featherstones have always had some\nmoney, and the Waules too. Waule had money too. A warm man was Waule.\nAy, ay; money’s a good egg; and if you’ve got money to leave behind\nyou, lay it in a warm nest. Good-by, Mrs. Waule.” Here Mr. Featherstone\npulled at both sides of his wig as if he wanted to deafen himself, and\nhis sister went away ruminating on this oracular speech of his.\nNotwithstanding her jealousy of the Vincys and of Mary Garth, there\nremained as the nethermost sediment in her mental shallows a persuasion\nthat her brother Peter Featherstone could never leave his chief\nproperty away from his blood-relations:—else, why had the Almighty\ncarried off his two wives both childless, after he had gained so much\nby manganese and things, turning up when nobody expected it?—and why\nwas there a Lowick parish church, and the Waules and Powderells all\nsitting in the same pew for generations, and the Featherstone pew next\nto them, if, the Sunday after her brother Peter’s death, everybody was\nto know that the property was gone out of the family? The human mind\nhas at no period accepted a moral chaos; and so preposterous a result\nwas not strictly conceivable. But we are frightened at much that is not\nstrictly conceivable.When Fred came in the old man eyed him with a peculiar twinkle, which\nthe younger had often had reason to interpret as pride in the\nsatisfactory details of his appearance.“You two misses go away,” said Mr. Featherstone. “I want to speak to\nFred.”“Come into my room, Rosamond, you will not mind the cold for a little\nwhile,” said Mary. The two girls had not only known each other in\nchildhood, but had been at the same provincial school together (Mary as\nan articled pupil), so that they had many memories in common, and liked\nvery well to talk in private. Indeed, this _tête-à-tête_ was one of\nRosamond’s objects in coming to Stone Court.Old Featherstone would not begin the dialogue till the door had been\nclosed. He continued to look at Fred with the same twinkle and with one\nof his habitual grimaces, alternately screwing and widening his mouth;\nand when he spoke, it was in a low tone, which might be taken for that\nof an informer ready to be bought off, rather than for the tone of an\noffended senior. He was not a man to feel any strong moral indignation\neven on account of trespasses against himself. It was natural that\nothers should want to get an advantage over him, but then, he was a\nlittle too cunning for them.“So, sir, you’ve been paying ten per cent for money which you’ve\npromised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I’m dead and gone, eh?\nYou put my life at a twelvemonth, say. But I can alter my will yet.”Fred blushed. He had not borrowed money in that way, for excellent\nreasons. But he was conscious of having spoken with some confidence\n(perhaps with more than he exactly remembered) about his prospect of\ngetting Featherstone’s land as a future means of paying present debts.“I don’t know what you refer to, sir. I have certainly never borrowed\nany money on such an insecurity. Please do explain.”"

I’m of sound mind—can reckon compound interest in my head, and\nremember every fool’s name as well as I could twenty years ago. What\nthe deuce? I’m under eighty. I say, you must contradict this story.”“I have contradicted it, sir,” Fred answered, with a touch of\nimpatience, not remembering that his uncle did not verbally\ndiscriminate contradicting from disproving, though no one was further\nfrom confounding the two ideas than old Featherstone, who often\nwondered that so many fools took his own assertions for proofs. “But I\ncontradict it again. The story is a silly lie.”“Nonsense! you must bring dockiments. It comes from authority.”“Name the authority, and make him name the man of whom I borrowed the\nmoney, and then I can disprove the story.”“It’s pretty good authority, I think—a man who knows most of what goes\non in Middlemarch. It’s that fine, religious, charitable uncle o’\nyours. Come now!” Here Mr. Featherstone had his peculiar inward shake\nwhich signified merriment.“Mr. Bulstrode?”“Who else, eh?”“Then the story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing words\nhe may have let fall about me. Do they pretend that he named the man\nwho lent me the money?”“If there is such a man, depend upon it Bulstrode knows him. But,\nsupposing you only tried to get the money lent, and didn’t get\nit—Bulstrode ’ud know that too. You bring me a writing from Bulstrode\nto say he doesn’t believe you’ve ever promised to pay your debts out o’\nmy land. Come now!”Mr. Featherstone’s face required its whole scale of grimaces as a\nmuscular outlet to his silent triumph in the soundness of his\nfaculties.Fred felt himself to be in a disgusting dilemma.“You must be joking, sir. Mr. Bulstrode, like other men, believes\nscores of things that are not true, and he has a prejudice against me.\nI could easily get him to write that he knew no facts in proof of the\nreport you speak of, though it might lead to unpleasantness. But I\ncould hardly ask him to write down what he believes or does not believe\nabout me.” Fred paused an instant, and then added, in politic appeal to\nhis uncle’s vanity, “That is hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask.”\nBut he was disappointed in the result."

He may come down any day, when the devil leaves\noff backing him. And that’s what his religion means: he wants God\nA’mighty to come in. That’s nonsense! There’s one thing I made out\npretty clear when I used to go to church—and it’s this: God A’mighty\nsticks to the land. He promises land, and He gives land, and He makes\nchaps rich with corn and cattle. But you take the other side. You like\nBulstrode and speckilation better than Featherstone and land.”“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Fred, rising, standing with his back to\nthe fire and beating his boot with his whip. “I like neither Bulstrode\nnor speculation.” He spoke rather sulkily, feeling himself stalemated.“Well, well, you can do without me, that’s pretty clear,” said old\nFeatherstone, secretly disliking the possibility that Fred would show\nhimself at all independent. “You neither want a bit of land to make a\nsquire of you instead of a starving parson, nor a lift of a hundred\npound by the way. It’s all one to me. I can make five codicils if I\nlike, and I shall keep my bank-notes for a nest-egg. It’s all one to\nme.”Fred colored again. Featherstone had rarely given him presents of\nmoney, and at this moment it seemed almost harder to part with the\nimmediate prospect of bank-notes than with the more distant prospect of\nthe land.“I am not ungrateful, sir. I never meant to show disregard for any kind\nintentions you might have towards me. On the contrary.”“Very good. Then prove it. You bring me a letter from Bulstrode saying\nhe doesn’t believe you’ve been cracking and promising to pay your debts\nout o’ my land, and then, if there’s any scrape you’ve got into, we’ll\nsee if I can’t back you a bit. Come now! That’s a bargain. Here, give\nme your arm. I’ll try and walk round the room.”Fred, in spite of his irritation, had kindness enough in him to be a\nlittle sorry for the unloved, unvenerated old man, who with his\ndropsical legs looked more than usually pitiable in walking. While\ngiving his arm, he thought that he should not himself like to be an old\nfellow with his constitution breaking up; and he waited\ngood-temperedly, first before the window to hear the wonted remarks\nabout the guinea-fowls and the weather-cock, and then before the scanty\nbook-shelves, of which the chief glories in dark calf were Josephus,\nCulpepper, Klopstock’s “Messiah,” and several volumes of the\n“Gentleman’s Magazine.”“Read me the names o’ the books.

They\ndid not think of sitting down, but stood at the toilet-table near the\nwindow while Rosamond took off her hat, adjusted her veil, and applied\nlittle touches of her finger-tips to her hair—hair of infantine\nfairness, neither flaxen nor yellow. Mary Garth seemed all the plainer\nstanding at an angle between the two nymphs—the one in the glass, and\nthe one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of heavenly blue,\ndeep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder\ncould put into them, and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner\nif these should happen to be less exquisite. Only a few children in\nMiddlemarch looked blond by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure\ndisplayed by her riding-habit had delicate undulations. In fact, most\nmen in Middlemarch, except her brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the\nbest girl in the world, and some called her an angel. Mary Garth, on\nthe contrary, had the aspect of an ordinary sinner: she was brown; her\ncurly dark hair was rough and stubborn; her stature was low; and it\nwould not be true to declare, in satisfactory antithesis, that she had\nall the virtues. Plainness has its peculiar temptations and vices quite\nas much as beauty; it is apt either to feign amiability, or, not\nfeigning it, to show all the repulsiveness of discontent: at any rate,\nto be called an ugly thing in contrast with that lovely creature your\ncompanion, is apt to produce some effect beyond a sense of fine\nveracity and fitness in the phrase. At the age of two-and-twenty Mary\nhad certainly not attained that perfect good sense and good principle\nwhich are usually recommended to the less fortunate girl, as if they\nwere to be obtained in quantities ready mixed, with a flavor of\nresignation as required. Her shrewdness had a streak of satiric\nbitterness continually renewed and never carried utterly out of sight,\nexcept by a strong current of gratitude towards those who, instead of\ntelling her that she ought to be contented, did something to make her\nso. Advancing womanhood had tempered her plainness, which was of a good\nhuman sort, such as the mothers of our race have very commonly worn in\nall latitudes under a more or less becoming headgear. Rembrandt would\nhave painted her with pleasure, and would have made her broad features\nlook out of the canvas with intelligent honesty. For honesty,\ntruth-telling fairness, was Mary’s reigning virtue: she neither tried\nto create illusions, nor indulged in them for her own behoof, and when\nshe was in a good mood she had humor enough in her to laugh at herself.\nWhen she and Rosamond happened both to be reflected in the glass, she\nsaid, laughingly—"

Oh, minding the house—pouring out syrup—pretending to be amiable\nand contented—learning to have a bad opinion of everybody.”“It is a wretched life for you.”“No,” said Mary, curtly, with a little toss of her head. “I think my\nlife is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan’s.”“Yes; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young.”“She is interesting to herself, I suppose; and I am not at all sure\nthat everything gets easier as one gets older.”“No,” said Rosamond, reflectively; “one wonders what such people do,\nwithout any prospect. To be sure, there is religion as a support. But,”\nshe added, dimpling, “it is very different with you, Mary. You may have\nan offer.”“Has any one told you he means to make me one?”“Of course not. I mean, there is a gentleman who may fall in love with\nyou, seeing you almost every day.”A certain change in Mary’s face was chiefly determined by the resolve\nnot to show any change.“Does that always make people fall in love?” she answered, carelessly;\n“it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting each other.”“Not when they are interesting and agreeable. I hear that Mr. Lydgate\nis both.”“Oh, Mr. Lydgate!” said Mary, with an unmistakable lapse into\nindifference. “You want to know something about him,” she added, not\nchoosing to indulge Rosamond’s indirectness.“Merely, how you like him.”"

Nothing escaped Lydgate in\nRosamond’s graceful behavior: how delicately she waived the notice\nwhich the old man’s want of taste had thrust upon her by a quiet\ngravity, not showing her dimples on the wrong occasion, but showing\nthem afterwards in speaking to Mary, to whom she addressed herself with\nso much good-natured interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining\nMary more fully than he had done before, saw an adorable kindness in\nRosamond’s eyes. But Mary from some cause looked rather out of temper.“Miss Rosy has been singing me a song—you’ve nothing to say against\nthat, eh, doctor?” said Mr. Featherstone. “I like it better than your\nphysic.”“That has made me forget how the time was going,” said Rosamond, rising\nto reach her hat, which she had laid aside before singing, so that her\nflower-like head on its white stem was seen in perfection above her\nriding-habit. “Fred, we must really go.”“Very good,” said Fred, who had his own reasons for not being in the\nbest spirits, and wanted to get away.“Miss Vincy is a musician?” said Lydgate, following her with his eyes.\n(Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness\nthat she was being looked at. She was by nature an actress of parts\nthat entered into her _physique:_ she even acted her own character, and\nso well, that she did not know it to be precisely her own.)“The best in Middlemarch, I’ll be bound,” said Mr. Featherstone, “let\nthe next be who she will.

Strangers, whether wrecked and clinging to a raft, or duly\nescorted and accompanied by portmanteaus, have always had a\ncircumstantial fascination for the virgin mind, against which native\nmerit has urged itself in vain. And a stranger was absolutely necessary\nto Rosamond’s social romance, which had always turned on a lover and\nbridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at\nall like her own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand\nthat he should somehow be related to a baronet. Now that she and the\nstranger had met, reality proved much more moving than anticipation,\nand Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great epoch of her life.\nShe judged of her own symptoms as those of awakening love, and she held\nit still more natural that Mr. Lydgate should have fallen in love at\nfirst sight of her. These things happened so often at balls, and why\nnot by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for\nit? Rosamond, though no older than Mary, was rather used to being\nfallen in love with; but she, for her part, had remained indifferent\nand fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor.\nAnd here was Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to her ideal, being\naltogether foreign to Middlemarch, carrying a certain air of\ndistinction congruous with good family, and possessing connections\nwhich offered vistas of that middle-class heaven, rank; a man of\ntalent, also, whom it would be especially delightful to enslave: in\nfact, a man who had touched her nature quite newly, and brought a vivid\ninterest into her life which was better than any fancied “might-be”\nsuch as she was in the habit of opposing to the actual.Thus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were preoccupied\nand inclined to be silent. Rosamond, whose basis for her structure had\nthe usual airy slightness, was of remarkably detailed and realistic\nimagination when the foundation had been once presupposed; and before\nthey had ridden a mile she was far on in the costume and introductions\nof her wedded life, having determined on her house in Middlemarch, and\nforeseen the visits she would pay to her husband’s high-bred relatives\nat a distance, whose finished manners she could appropriate as\nthoroughly as she had done her school accomplishments, preparing\nherself thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come. There\nwas nothing financial, still less sordid, in her previsions: she cared\nabout what were considered refinements, and not about the money that\nwas to pay for them."
