If you were\nan artist, you would think of Mistress Second-Cousin as antique form\nanimated by Christian sentiment—a sort of Christian Antigone—sensuous\nforce controlled by spiritual passion.”“Yes, and that your painting her was the chief outcome of her\nexistence—the divinity passing into higher completeness and all but\nexhausted in the act of covering your bit of canvas. I am amateurish if\nyou like: I do _not_ think that all the universe is straining towards\nthe obscure significance of your pictures.”“But it is, my dear!—so far as it is straining through me, Adolf\nNaumann: that stands firm,” said the good-natured painter, putting a\nhand on Ladislaw’s shoulder, and not in the least disturbed by the\nunaccountable touch of ill-humor in his tone. “See now! My existence\npresupposes the existence of the whole universe—does it _not?_ and my\nfunction is to paint—and as a painter I have a conception which is\naltogether _genialisch_, of your great-aunt or second grandmother as a\nsubject for a picture; therefore, the universe is straining towards\nthat picture through that particular hook or claw which it puts forth\nin the shape of me—not true?”“But how if another claw in the shape of me is straining to thwart\nit?—the case is a little less simple then.”“Not at all: the result of the struggle is the same thing—picture or no\npicture—logically.”Will could not resist this imperturbable temper, and the cloud in his\nface broke into sunshiny laughter.“Come now, my friend—you will help?” said Naumann, in a hopeful tone."

You\nwould only have made a better or worse portrait with a background which\nevery connoisseur would give a different reason for or against. And\nwhat is a portrait of a woman? Your painting and Plastik are poor stuff\nafter all. They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising them.\nLanguage is a finer medium.”“Yes, for those who can’t paint,” said Naumann. “There you have perfect\nright. I did not recommend you to paint, my friend.”The amiable artist carried his sting, but Ladislaw did not choose to\nappear stung. He went on as if he had not heard.“Language gives a fuller image, which is all the better for being\nvague. After all, the true seeing is within; and painting stares at you\nwith an insistent imperfection. I feel that especially about\nrepresentations of women. As if a woman were a mere colored\nsuperficies! You must wait for movement and tone. There is a difference\nin their very breathing: they change from moment to moment.—This woman\nwhom you have just seen, for example: how would you paint her voice,\npray? But her voice is much diviner than anything you have seen of\nher.”“I see, I see. You are jealous. No man must presume to think that he\ncan paint your ideal. This is serious, my friend! Your great-aunt! ‘Der\nNeffe als Onkel’ in a tragic sense—_ungeheuer!_”“You and I shall quarrel, Naumann, if you call that lady my aunt\nagain.”“How is she to be called then?”“Mrs. Casaubon.”“Good. Suppose I get acquainted with her in spite of you, and find that\nshe very much wishes to be painted?”“Yes, suppose!” said Will Ladislaw, in a contemptuous undertone,\nintended to dismiss the subject. He was conscious of being irritated by\nridiculously small causes, which were half of his own creation. Why was\nhe making any fuss about Mrs. Casaubon? And yet he felt as if something\nhad happened to him with regard to her. There are characters which are\ncontinually creating collisions and nodes for themselves in dramas\nwhich nobody is prepared to act with them. Their susceptibilities will\nclash against objects that remain innocently quiet.CHAPTER XX.“A child forsaken, waking suddenly,\nWhose gaze afeard on all things round doth rove,\nAnd seeth only that it cannot see\n    The meeting eyes of love.”"

And Mr. Casaubon\nwas certain to remain away for some time at the Vatican.Yet Dorothea had no distinctly shapen grievance that she could state\neven to herself; and in the midst of her confused thought and passion,\nthe mental act that was struggling forth into clearness was a\nself-accusing cry that her feeling of desolation was the fault of her\nown spiritual poverty. She had married the man of her choice, and with\nthe advantage over most girls that she had contemplated her marriage\nchiefly as the beginning of new duties: from the very first she had\nthought of Mr. Casaubon as having a mind so much above her own, that he\nmust often be claimed by studies which she could not entirely share;\nmoreover, after the brief narrow experience of her girlhood she was\nbeholding Rome, the city of visible history, where the past of a whole\nhemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral\nimages and trophies gathered from afar."

Dorothea had now been five weeks in\nRome, and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go\nhand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would presently\nsurvive in chiller loneliness, she had driven about at first with Mr.\nCasaubon, but of late chiefly with Tantripp and their experienced\ncourier. She had been led through the best galleries, had been taken to\nthe chief points of view, had been shown the grandest ruins and the\nmost glorious churches, and she had ended by oftenest choosing to drive\nout to the Campagna where she could feel alone with the earth and sky,\naway-from the oppressive masquerade of ages, in which her own life too\nseemed to become a masque with enigmatical costumes."

  "content": "To those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power of a\nknowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes, and\ntraces out the suppressed transitions which unite all contrasts, Rome\nmay still be the spiritual centre and interpreter of the world. But let\nthem conceive one more historical contrast: the gigantic broken\nrevelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly on the\nnotions of a girl who had been brought up in English and Swiss\nPuritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories and on art chiefly of\nthe hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent nature turned all her small\nallowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her actions into their\nmould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the\nquality of a pleasure or a pain; a girl who had lately become a wife,\nand from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself\nplunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot. The weight\nof unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it\nformed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo-foreign society;\nbut Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions. Ruins and\nbasilicas, palaces and colossi, set in the midst of a sordid present,\nwhere all that was living and warm-blooded seemed sunk in the deep\ndegeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence; the dimmer but\nyet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings; the\nlong vistas of white forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold the\nmonotonous light of an alien world: all this vast wreck of ambitious\nideals, sensuous and spiritual, mixed confusedly with the signs of\nbreathing forgetfulness and degradation, at first jarred her as with an\nelectric shock, and then urged themselves on her with that ache\nbelonging to a glut of confused ideas which check the flow of emotion.\nForms both pale and glowing took possession of her young sense, and\nfixed themselves in her memory even when she was not thinking of them,\npreparing strange associations which remained through her after-years.\nOur moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other\nlike the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain states of\ndull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the vastness of\nSt. Peter’s, the huge bronze canopy, the excited intention in the\nattitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the mosaics\nabove, and the red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading\nitself everywhere like a disease of the retina."

  "content": "Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea’s was anything very\nexceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among\nincongruities and left to “find their feet” among them, while their\nelders go about their business. Nor can I suppose that when Mrs.\nCasaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her wedding,\nthe situation will be regarded as tragic. Some discouragement, some\nfaintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary,\nis not unusual, and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what\nis not unusual. That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of\nfrequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of\nmankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it. If we had\na keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like\nhearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die\nof that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the\nquickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity."

  "content": "However, Dorothea was crying, and if she had been required to state the\ncause, she could only have done so in some such general words as I have\nalready used: to have been driven to be more particular would have been\nlike trying to give a history of the lights and shadows, for that new\nreal future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from\nthe endless minutiae by which her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely\nrelation, now that she was married to him, was gradually changing with\nthe secret motion of a watch-hand from what it had been in her maiden\ndream. It was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least\nadmit the change, still more for her to have readjusted that\ndevotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she\nwas almost sure sooner or later to recover it. Permanent rebellion, the\ndisorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve, was not\npossible to her; but she was now in an interval when the very force of\nher nature heightened its confusion. In this way, the early months of\nmarriage often are times of critical tumult—whether that of a\nshrimp-pool or of deeper waters—which afterwards subsides into cheerful\npeace.But was not Mr. Casaubon just as learned as before? Had his forms of\nexpression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable? Oh\nwaywardness of womanhood! did his chronology fail him, or his ability\nto state not only a theory but the names of those who held it; or his\nprovision for giving the heads of any subject on demand? And was not\nRome the place in all the world to give free play to such\naccomplishments? Besides, had not Dorothea’s enthusiasm especially\ndwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight and perhaps the sadness\nwith which great tasks lie on him who has to achieve them?— And that\nsuch weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was only plainer than before.All these are crushing questions; but whatever else remained the same,\nthe light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at noonday.\nThe fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are\nacquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few\nimaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of\nmarried companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than\nwhat you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether\nthe same. And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is\nfelt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it. To share lodgings\nwith a brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite politician\nin the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in these cases\ntoo we begin by knowing little and believing much, and we sometimes end\nby inverting the quantities."

  "content": "Still, such comparisons might mislead, for no man was more incapable of\nflashy make-believe than Mr. Casaubon: he was as genuine a character as\nany ruminant animal, and he had not actively assisted in creating any\nillusions about himself. How was it that in the weeks since her\nmarriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling\ndepression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had\ndreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and\nwinding passages which seemed to lead nowhither? I suppose it was that\nin courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and\nthe smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee\ndelightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal. But\nthe door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on\nthe present. Having once embarked on your marital voyage, it is\nimpossible not to be aware that you make no way and that the sea is not\nwithin sight—that, in fact, you are exploring an enclosed basin.In their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on\nsome explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see\nthe bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness\nof their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she\nhad listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments\nto be brought against Mr. Casaubon’s entirely new view of the\nPhilistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter\nshe should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same\nhigh ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him. Again,\nthe matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he\ntreated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily\naccounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in\nwhich she herself shared during their engagement. But now, since they\nhad been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to\ntumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements,\nshe had been becoming more and more aware, with a certain terror, that\nher mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and\nrepulsion, or else into forlorn weariness. How far the judicious Hooker\nor any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr.\nCasaubon’s time of life, she had no means of knowing, so that he could\nnot have the advantage of comparison; but her husband’s way of\ncommenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to\naffect her with a sort of mental shiver: he had perhaps the best\nintention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting\nhimself. What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his; and such\ncapacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by\nthe general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried\npreparation, a lifeless embalmment of knowledge."

  "content": "When he said, “Does this interest you, Dorothea? Shall we stay a little\nlonger? I am ready to stay if you wish it,”—it seemed to her as if\ngoing or staying were alike dreary. Or, “Should you like to go to the\nFarnesina, Dorothea? It contains celebrated frescos designed or painted\nby Raphael, which most persons think it worth while to visit.”“But do you care about them?” was always Dorothea’s question.“They are, I believe, highly esteemed. Some of them represent the fable\nof Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic invention of a\nliterary period, and cannot, I think, be reckoned as a genuine mythical\nproduct. But if you like these wall-paintings we can easily drive\nthither; and you will then, I think, have seen the chief works of\nRaphael, any of which it were a pity to omit in a visit to Rome. He is\nthe painter who has been held to combine the most complete grace of\nform with sublimity of expression. Such at least I have gathered to be\nthe opinion of cognoscenti.”This kind of answer given in a measured official tone, as of a\nclergyman reading according to the rubric, did not help to justify the\nglories of the Eternal City, or to give her the hope that if she knew\nmore about them the world would be joyously illuminated for her. There\nis hardly any contact more depressing to a young ardent creature than\nthat of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in\na blank absence of interest or sympathy.On other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of occupation\nand an eagerness which are usually regarded as the effect of\nenthusiasm, and Dorothea was anxious to follow this spontaneous\ndirection of his thoughts, instead of being made to feel that she\ndragged him away from it. But she was gradually ceasing to expect with\nher former delightful confidence that she should see any wide opening\nwhere she followed him. Poor Mr. Casaubon himself was lost among small\nclosets and winding stairs, and in an agitated dimness about the\nCabeiri, or in an exposure of other mythologists’ ill-considered\nparallels, easily lost sight of any purpose which had prompted him to\nthese labors. With his taper stuck before him he forgot the absence of\nwindows, and in bitter manuscript remarks on other men’s notions about\nthe solar deities, he had become indifferent to the sunlight."

  "content": "These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon,\nmight have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been\nencouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he would\nhave held her hands between his and listened with the delight of\ntenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up\nher experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in\nreturn, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual\nknowledge and affection—or if she could have fed her affection with\nthose childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who\nhas begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll,\ncreating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own\nlove. That was Dorothea’s bent. With all her yearning to know what was\nafar from her and to be widely benignant, she had ardor enough for what\nwas near, to have kissed Mr. Casaubon’s coat-sleeve, or to have\ncaressed his shoe-latchet, if he would have made any other sign of\nacceptance than pronouncing her, with his unfailing propriety, to be of\na most affectionate and truly feminine nature, indicating at the same\ntime by politely reaching a chair for her that he regarded these\nmanifestations as rather crude and startling. Having made his clerical\ntoilet with due care in the morning, he was prepared only for those\namenities of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat\nof the period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter.And by a sad contradiction Dorothea’s ideas and resolves seemed like\nmelting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they had been\nbut another form. She was humiliated to find herself a mere victim of\nfeeling, as if she could know nothing except through that medium: all\nher strength was scattered in fits of agitation, of struggle, of\ndespondency, and then again in visions of more complete renunciation,\ntransforming all hard conditions into duty. Poor Dorothea! she was\ncertainly troublesome—to herself chiefly; but this morning for the\nfirst time she had been troublesome to Mr. Casaubon.She had begun, while they were taking coffee, with a determination to\nshake off what she inwardly called her selfishness, and turned a face\nall cheerful attention to her husband when he said, “My dear Dorothea,\nwe must now think of all that is yet left undone, as a preliminary to\nour departure. I would fain have returned home earlier that we might\nhave been at Lowick for the Christmas; but my inquiries here have been\nprotracted beyond their anticipated period. I trust, however, that the\ntime here has not been passed unpleasantly to you. Among the sights of\nEurope, that of Rome has ever been held one of the most striking and in\nsome respects edifying. I well remember that I considered it an epoch\nin my life when I visited it for the first time; after the fall of\nNapoleon, an event which opened the Continent to travellers. Indeed I\nthink it is one among several cities to which an extreme hyperbole has\nbeen applied—‘See Rome and die:’ but in your case I would propose an\nemendation and say, See Rome as a bride, and live henceforth as a happy\nwife.”"

  "content": "Mr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most conscientious\nintention, blinking a little and swaying his head up and down, and\nconcluding with a smile. He had not found marriage a rapturous state,\nbut he had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable\nhusband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved\nto be.“I hope you are thoroughly satisfied with our stay—I mean, with the\nresult so far as your studies are concerned,” said Dorothea, trying to\nkeep her mind fixed on what most affected her husband.“Yes,” said Mr. Casaubon, with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes\nthe word half a negative. “I have been led farther than I had foreseen,\nand various subjects for annotation have presented themselves which,\nthough I have no direct need of them, I could not pretermit. The task,\nnotwithstanding the assistance of my amanuensis, has been a somewhat\nlaborious one, but your society has happily prevented me from that too\ncontinuous prosecution of thought beyond the hours of study which has\nbeen the snare of my solitary life.”“I am very glad that my presence has made any difference to you,” said\nDorothea, who had a vivid memory of evenings in which she had supposed\nthat Mr. Casaubon’s mind had gone too deep during the day to be able to\nget to the surface again. I fear there was a little temper in her\nreply. “I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall be more useful to you,\nand be able to enter a little more into what interests you.”“Doubtless, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow. “The notes\nI have here made will want sifting, and you can, if you please, extract\nthem under my direction.”“And all your notes,” said Dorothea, whose heart had already burned\nwithin her on this subject, so that now she could not help speaking\nwith her tongue. “All those rows of volumes—will you not now do what\nyou used to speak of?—will you not make up your mind what part of them\nyou will use, and begin to write the book which will make your vast\nknowledge useful to the world? I will write to your dictation, or I\nwill copy and extract what you tell me: I can be of no other use.”\nDorothea, in a most unaccountable, darkly feminine manner, ended with a\nslight sob and eyes full of tears."

  "content": "The excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly\ndisturbing to Mr. Casaubon, but there were other reasons why Dorothea’s\nwords were among the most cutting and irritating to him that she could\nhave been impelled to use. She was as blind to his inward troubles as\nhe to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her\nhusband which claim our pity. She had not yet listened patiently to his\nheartbeats, but only felt that her own was beating violently. In Mr.\nCasaubon’s ear, Dorothea’s voice gave loud emphatic iteration to those\nmuffled suggestions of consciousness which it was possible to explain\nas mere fancy, the illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness: always when\nsuch suggestions are unmistakably repeated from without, they are\nresisted as cruel and unjust. We are angered even by the full\nacceptance of our humiliating confessions—how much more by hearing in\nhard distinct syllables from the lips of a near observer, those\nconfused murmurs which we try to call morbid, and strive against as if\nthey were the oncoming of numbness! And this cruel outward accuser was\nthere in the shape of a wife—nay, of a young bride, who, instead of\nobserving his abundant pen-scratches and amplitude of paper with the\nuncritical awe of an elegant-minded canary-bird, seemed to present\nherself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of inference.\nHere, towards this particular point of the compass, Mr. Casaubon had a\nsensitiveness to match Dorothea’s, and an equal quickness to imagine\nmore than the fact. He had formerly observed with approbation her\ncapacity for worshipping the right object; he now foresaw with sudden\nterror that this capacity might be replaced by presumption, this\nworship by the most exasperating of all criticism,—that which sees\nvaguely a great many fine ends, and has not the least notion what it\ncosts to reach them.For the first time since Dorothea had known him, Mr. Casaubon’s face\nhad a quick angry flush upon it.“My love,” he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, “you may\nrely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the\ndifferent stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile\nconjectures of ignorant onlookers. It had been easy for me to gain a\ntemporary effect by a mirage of baseless opinion; but it is ever the\ntrial of the scrupulous explorer to be saluted with the impatient scorn\nof chatterers who attempt only the smallest achievements, being indeed\nequipped for no other. And it were well if all such could be admonished\nto discriminate judgments of which the true subject-matter lies\nentirely beyond their reach, from those of which the elements may be\ncompassed by a narrow and superficial survey.”This speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite unusual\nwith Mr. Casaubon. It was not indeed entirely an improvisation, but had\ntaken shape in inward colloquy, and rushed out like the round grains\nfrom a fruit when sudden heat cracks it. Dorothea was not only his\nwife: she was a personification of that shallow world which surrounds\nthe appreciated or desponding author.Dorothea was indignant in her turn. Had she not been repressing\neverything in herself except the desire to enter into some fellowship\nwith her husband’s chief interests?“My judgment _was_ a very superficial one—such as I am capable of\nforming,” she answered, with a prompt resentment, that needed no\nrehearsal. “You showed me the rows of notebooks—you have often spoken\nof them—you have often said that they wanted digesting. But I never\nheard you speak of the writing that is to be published. Those were very\nsimple facts, and my judgment went no farther. I only begged you to let\nme be of some good to you.”"

  "content": "Dorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply, taking\nup a letter which lay beside him as if to reperuse it. Both were\nshocked at their mutual situation—that each should have betrayed anger\ntowards the other. If they had been at home, settled at Lowick in\nordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would have been less\nembarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express object of which is\nto isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each\nother, the sense of disagreement is, to say the least, confounding and\nstultifying. To have changed your longitude extensively and placed\nyourselves in a moral solitude in order to have small explosions, to\nfind conversation difficult and to hand a glass of water without\nlooking, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory fulfilment even to the\ntoughest minds. To Dorothea’s inexperienced sensitiveness, it seemed\nlike a catastrophe, changing all prospects; and to Mr. Casaubon it was\na new pain, he never having been on a wedding journey before, or found\nhimself in that close union which was more of a subjection than he had\nbeen able to imagine, since this charming young bride not only obliged\nhim to much consideration on her behalf (which he had sedulously\ngiven), but turned out to be capable of agitating him cruelly just\nwhere he most needed soothing. Instead of getting a soft fence against\nthe cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given\nit a more substantial presence?Neither of them felt it possible to speak again at present. To have\nreversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been\na show of persistent anger which Dorothea’s conscience shrank from,\nseeing that she already began to feel herself guilty. However just her\nindignation might be, her ideal was not to claim justice, but to give\ntenderness. So when the carriage came to the door, she drove with Mr.\nCasaubon to the Vatican, walked with him through the stony avenue of\ninscriptions, and when she parted with him at the entrance to the\nLibrary, went on through the Museum out of mere listlessness as to what\nwas around her. She had not spirit to turn round and say that she would\ndrive anywhere. It was when Mr. Casaubon was quitting her that Naumann\nhad first seen her, and he had entered the long gallery of sculpture at\nthe same time with her; but here Naumann had to await Ladislaw with\nwhom he was to settle a bet of champagne about an enigmatical\nmediaeval-looking figure there. After they had examined the figure, and\nhad walked on finishing their dispute, they had parted, Ladislaw\nlingering behind while Naumann had gone into the Hall of Statues where\nhe again saw Dorothea, and saw her in that brooding abstraction which\nmade her pose remarkable. She did not really see the streak of sunlight\non the floor more than she saw the statues: she was inwardly seeing the\nlight of years to come in her own home and over the English fields and\nelms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that the way in which\nthey might be filled with joyful devotedness was not so clear to her as\nit had been. But in Dorothea’s mind there was a current into which all\nthought and feeling were apt sooner or later to flow—the reaching\nforward of the whole consciousness towards the fullest truth, the least\npartial good. There was clearly something better than anger and\ndespondency.CHAPTER XXI.“Hire facounde eke full womanly and plain,\nNo contrefeted termes had she\nTo semen wise.”\n—CHAUCER."

  "content": "It was in that way Dorothea came to be sobbing as soon as she was\nsecurely alone. But she was presently roused by a knock at the door,\nwhich made her hastily dry her eyes before saying, “Come in.” Tantripp\nhad brought a card, and said that there was a gentleman waiting in the\nlobby. The courier had told him that only Mrs. Casaubon was at home,\nbut he said he was a relation of Mr. Casaubon’s: would she see him?“Yes,” said Dorothea, without pause; “show him into the salon.” Her\nchief impressions about young Ladislaw were that when she had seen him\nat Lowick she had been made aware of Mr. Casaubon’s generosity towards\nhim, and also that she had been interested in his own hesitation about\nhis career. She was alive to anything that gave her an opportunity for\nactive sympathy, and at this moment it seemed as if the visit had come\nto shake her out of her self-absorbed discontent—to remind her of her\nhusband’s goodness, and make her feel that she had now the right to be\nhis helpmate in all kind deeds. She waited a minute or two, but when\nshe passed into the next room there were just signs enough that she had\nbeen crying to make her open face look more youthful and appealing than\nusual. She met Ladislaw with that exquisite smile of good-will which is\nunmixed with vanity, and held out her hand to him. He was the elder by\nseveral years, but at that moment he looked much the younger, for his\ntransparent complexion flushed suddenly, and he spoke with a shyness\nextremely unlike the ready indifference of his manner with his male\ncompanion, while Dorothea became all the calmer with a wondering desire\nto put him at ease.“I was not aware that you and Mr. Casaubon were in Rome, until this\nmorning, when I saw you in the Vatican Museum,” he said. “I knew you at\nonce—but—I mean, that I concluded Mr. Casaubon’s address would be found\nat the Poste Restante, and I was anxious to pay my respects to him and\nyou as early as possible.”“Pray sit down. He is not here now, but he will be glad to hear of you,\nI am sure,” said Dorothea, seating herself unthinkingly between the\nfire and the light of the tall window, and pointing to a chair\nopposite, with the quietude of a benignant matron. The signs of girlish\nsorrow in her face were only the more striking. “Mr. Casaubon is much\nengaged; but you will leave your address—will you not?—and he will\nwrite to you.”"

  "content": "“You are very good,” said Ladislaw, beginning to lose his diffidence in\nthe interest with which he was observing the signs of weeping which had\naltered her face. “My address is on my card. But if you will allow me I\nwill call again to-morrow at an hour when Mr. Casaubon is likely to be\nat home.”“He goes to read in the Library of the Vatican every day, and you can\nhardly see him except by an appointment. Especially now. We are about\nto leave Rome, and he is very busy. He is usually away almost from\nbreakfast till dinner. But I am sure he will wish you to dine with us.”Will Ladislaw was struck mute for a few moments. He had never been fond\nof Mr. Casaubon, and if it had not been for the sense of obligation,\nwould have laughed at him as a Bat of erudition. But the idea of this\ndried-up pedant, this elaborator of small explanations about as\nimportant as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a vendor’s\nback chamber, having first got this adorable young creature to marry\nhim, and then passing his honeymoon away from her, groping after his\nmouldy futilities (Will was given to hyperbole)—this sudden picture\nstirred him with a sort of comic disgust: he was divided between the\nimpulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse to burst\ninto scornful invective.For an instant he felt that the struggle was causing a queer contortion\nof his mobile features, but with a good effort he resolved it into\nnothing more offensive than a merry smile.Dorothea wondered; but the smile was irresistible, and shone back from\nher face too. Will Ladislaw’s smile was delightful, unless you were\nangry with him beforehand: it was a gush of inward light illuminating\nthe transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve\nand line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and\nbanishing forever the traces of moodiness. The reflection of that smile\ncould not but have a little merriment in it too, even under dark\neyelashes still moist, as Dorothea said inquiringly, “Something amuses\nyou?”“Yes,” said Will, quick in finding resources. “I am thinking of the\nsort of figure I cut the first time I saw you, when you annihilated my\npoor sketch with your criticism.”"

  "content": "“My criticism?” said Dorothea, wondering still more. “Surely not. I\nalways feel particularly ignorant about painting.”“I suspected you of knowing so much, that you knew how to say just what\nwas most cutting. You said—I dare say you don’t remember it as I\ndo—that the relation of my sketch to nature was quite hidden from you.\nAt least, you implied that.” Will could laugh now as well as smile.“That was really my ignorance,” said Dorothea, admiring Will’s\ngood-humor. “I must have said so only because I never could see any\nbeauty in the pictures which my uncle told me all judges thought very\nfine. And I have gone about with just the same ignorance in Rome. There\nare comparatively few paintings that I can really enjoy. At first when\nI enter a room where the walls are covered with frescos, or with rare\npictures, I feel a kind of awe—like a child present at great ceremonies\nwhere there are grand robes and processions; I feel myself in the\npresence of some higher life than my own. But when I begin to examine\nthe pictures one by one the life goes out of them, or else is something\nviolent and strange to me. It must be my own dulness. I am seeing so\nmuch all at once, and not understanding half of it. That always makes\none feel stupid. It is painful to be told that anything is very fine\nand not be able to feel that it is fine—something like being blind,\nwhile people talk of the sky.”“Oh, there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be\nacquired,” said Will. (It was impossible now to doubt the directness of\nDorothea’s confession.) “Art is an old language with a great many\nartificial affected styles, and sometimes the chief pleasure one gets\nout of knowing them is the mere sense of knowing. I enjoy the art of\nall sorts here immensely; but I suppose if I could pick my enjoyment to\npieces I should find it made up of many different threads. There is\nsomething in daubing a little one’s self, and having an idea of the\nprocess.”"

  "content": "“You mean perhaps to be a painter?” said Dorothea, with a new direction\nof interest. “You mean to make painting your profession? Mr. Casaubon\nwill like to hear that you have chosen a profession.”“No, oh no,” said Will, with some coldness. “I have quite made up my\nmind against it. It is too one-sided a life. I have been seeing a great\ndeal of the German artists here: I travelled from Frankfort with one of\nthem. Some are fine, even brilliant fellows—but I should not like to\nget into their way of looking at the world entirely from the studio\npoint of view.”“That I can understand,” said Dorothea, cordially. “And in Rome it\nseems as if there were so many things which are more wanted in the\nworld than pictures. But if you have a genius for painting, would it\nnot be right to take that as a guide? Perhaps you might do better\nthings than these—or different, so that there might not be so many\npictures almost all alike in the same place.”There was no mistaking this simplicity, and Will was won by it into\nfrankness. “A man must have a very rare genius to make changes of that\nsort. I am afraid mine would not carry me even to the pitch of doing\nwell what has been done already, at least not so well as to make it\nworth while. And I should never succeed in anything by dint of\ndrudgery. If things don’t come easily to me I never get them.”“I have heard Mr. Casaubon say that he regrets your want of patience,”\nsaid Dorothea, gently. She was rather shocked at this mode of taking\nall life as a holiday.“Yes, I know Mr. Casaubon’s opinion. He and I differ.”The slight streak of contempt in this hasty reply offended Dorothea.\nShe was all the more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of her\nmorning’s trouble.“Certainly you differ,” she said, rather proudly. “I did not think of\ncomparing you: such power of persevering devoted labor as Mr.\nCasaubon’s is not common.”"

  "content": "Will saw that she was offended, but this only gave an additional\nimpulse to the new irritation of his latent dislike towards Mr.\nCasaubon. It was too intolerable that Dorothea should be worshipping\nthis husband: such weakness in a woman is pleasant to no man but the\nhusband in question. Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out\nof their neighbor’s buzzing glory, and think that such killing is no\nmurder.“No, indeed,” he answered, promptly. “And therefore it is a pity that\nit should be thrown away, as so much English scholarship is, for want\nof knowing what is being done by the rest of the world. If Mr. Casaubon\nread German he would save himself a great deal of trouble.”“I do not understand you,” said Dorothea, startled and anxious.“I merely mean,” said Will, in an offhand way, “that the Germans have\ntaken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which\nare got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have\nmade good roads. When I was with Mr. Casaubon I saw that he deafened\nhimself in that direction: it was almost against his will that he read\na Latin treatise written by a German. I was very sorry.”Will only thought of giving a good pinch that would annihilate that\nvaunted laboriousness, and was unable to imagine the mode in which\nDorothea would be wounded. Young Mr. Ladislaw was not at all deep\nhimself in German writers; but very little achievement is required in\norder to pity another man’s shortcomings.Poor Dorothea felt a pang at the thought that the labor of her\nhusband’s life might be void, which left her no energy to spare for the\nquestion whether this young relative who was so much obliged to him\nought not to have repressed his observation. She did not even speak,\nbut sat looking at her hands, absorbed in the piteousness of that\nthought.Will, however, having given that annihilating pinch, was rather\nashamed, imagining from Dorothea’s silence that he had offended her\nstill more; and having also a conscience about plucking the\ntail-feathers from a benefactor.“I regretted it especially,” he resumed, taking the usual course from\ndetraction to insincere eulogy, “because of my gratitude and respect\ntowards my cousin. It would not signify so much in a man whose talents\nand character were less distinguished.”"

  "content": "Dorothea raised her eyes, brighter than usual with excited feeling, and\nsaid in her saddest recitative, “How I wish I had learned German when I\nwas at Lausanne! There were plenty of German teachers. But now I can be\nof no use.”There was a new light, but still a mysterious light, for Will in\nDorothea’s last words. The question how she had come to accept Mr.\nCasaubon—which he had dismissed when he first saw her by saying that\nshe must be disagreeable in spite of appearances—was not now to be\nanswered on any such short and easy method. Whatever else she might be,\nshe was not disagreeable. She was not coldly clever and indirectly\nsatirical, but adorably simple and full of feeling. She was an angel\nbeguiled. It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the\nmelodious fragments in which her heart and soul came forth so directly\nand ingenuously. The Aeolian harp again came into his mind.She must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage.\nAnd if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her off to his\nlair with his talons simply and without legal forms, it would have been\nan unavoidable feat of heroism to release her and fall at her feet. But\nhe was something more unmanageable than a dragon: he was a benefactor\nwith collective society at his back, and he was at that moment entering\nthe room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor, while\nDorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm and regret, and\nWill was looking animated with his admiring speculation about her\nfeelings."

  "content": "Mr. Casaubon felt a surprise which was quite unmixed with pleasure, but\nhe did not swerve from his usual politeness of greeting, when Will rose\nand explained his presence. Mr. Casaubon was less happy than usual, and\nthis perhaps made him look all the dimmer and more faded; else, the\neffect might easily have been produced by the contrast of his young\ncousin’s appearance. The first impression on seeing Will was one of\nsunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing\nexpression. Surely, his very features changed their form, his jaw\nlooked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in\nhis nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head\nquickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought\nthey saw decided genius in this coruscation. Mr. Casaubon, on the\ncontrary, stood rayless.As Dorothea’s eyes were turned anxiously on her husband she was perhaps\nnot insensible to the contrast, but it was only mingled with other\ncauses in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf\nwhich was the first stirring of a pitying tenderness fed by the\nrealities of his lot and not by her own dreams. Yet it was a source of\ngreater freedom to her that Will was there; his young equality was\nagreeable, and also perhaps his openness to conviction. She felt an\nimmense need of some one to speak to, and she had never before seen any\none who seemed so quick and pliable, so likely to understand\neverything.Mr. Casaubon gravely hoped that Will was passing his time profitably as\nwell as pleasantly in Rome—had thought his intention was to remain in\nSouth Germany—but begged him to come and dine to-morrow, when he could\nconverse more at large: at present he was somewhat weary. Ladislaw\nunderstood, and accepting the invitation immediately took his leave.Dorothea’s eyes followed her husband anxiously, while he sank down\nwearily at the end of a sofa, and resting his elbow supported his head\nand looked on the floor. A little flushed, and with bright eyes, she\nseated herself beside him, and said—“Forgive me for speaking so hastily to you this morning. I was wrong. I\nfear I hurt you and made the day more burdensome.”“I am glad that you feel that, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon. He spoke\nquietly and bowed his head a little, but there was still an uneasy\nfeeling in his eyes as he looked at her.“But you do forgive me?” said Dorothea, with a quick sob. In her need\nfor some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own\nfault. Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on its\nneck and kiss it?“My dear Dorothea—‘who with repentance is not satisfied, is not of\nheaven nor earth:’—you do not think me worthy to be banished by that\nsevere sentence,” said Mr. Casaubon, exerting himself to make a strong\nstatement, and also to smile faintly."

  "content": "Dorothea was silent, but a tear which had come up with the sob would\ninsist on falling.“You are excited, my dear. And I also am feeling some unpleasant\nconsequences of too much mental disturbance,” said Mr. Casaubon. In\nfact, he had it in his thought to tell her that she ought not to have\nreceived young Ladislaw in his absence: but he abstained, partly from\nthe sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the\nmoment of her penitent acknowledgment, partly because he wanted to\navoid further agitation of himself by speech, and partly because he was\ntoo proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so\nexhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in\nother directions. There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little\nfire: it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp\ndespondency of uneasy egoism.“I think it is time for us to dress,” he added, looking at his watch.\nThey both rose, and there was never any further allusion between them\nto what had passed on this day.But Dorothea remembered it to the last with the vividness with which we\nall remember epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies,\nor some new motive is born. Today she had begun to see that she had\nbeen under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from\nMr. Casaubon, and she had felt the waking of a presentiment that there\nmight be a sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on\nhis side as on her own.We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder\nto feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from\nthat stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she\nwould devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his\nstrength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is\nno longer reflection but feeling—an idea wrought back to the directness\nof sense, like the solidity of objects—that he had an equivalent centre\nof self, whence the lights and shadows must always fall with a certain\ndifference.CHAPTER XXII."
