  "content": "“Well, perhaps others thought you might have done better. But it would\nhave been worse for me. And that is what touches me close about Fred.\nThe lad is good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he’s put in the\nright way; and he loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she\nhas given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out. I say,\nthat young man’s soul is in my hand; and I’ll do the best I can for\nhim, so help me God! It’s my duty, Susan.”Mrs. Garth was not given to tears, but there was a large one rolling\ndown her face before her husband had finished. It came from the\npressure of various feelings, in which there was much affection and\nsome vexation. She wiped it away quickly, saying—“Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in\nthat way, Caleb.”“That signifies nothing—what other men would think. I’ve got a clear\nfeeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will\ngo with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary,\npoor child.”Caleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards\nhis wife. She rose and kissed him, saying, “God bless you, Caleb! Our\nchildren have a good father.”But she went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of\nher words. She felt sure that her husband’s conduct would be\nmisunderstood, and about Fred she was rational and unhopeful. Which\nwould turn out to have the more foresight in it—her rationality or\nCaleb’s ardent generosity?When Fred went to the office the next morning, there was a test to be\ngone through which he was not prepared for.“Now Fred,” said Caleb, “you will have some desk-work. I have always\ndone a good deal of writing myself, but I can’t do without help, and as\nI want you to understand the accounts and get the values into your\nhead, I mean to do without another clerk. So you must buckle to. How\nare you at writing and arithmetic?”Fred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he had not thought of\ndesk-work; but he was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink. “I’m\nnot afraid of arithmetic, Mr. Garth: it always came easily to me. I\nthink you know my writing.”“Let us see,” said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and\nhanding it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper. “Copy me\na line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end.”"

  "content": "At that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to\nwrite legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk. Fred\nwrote the lines demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any\nviscount or bishop of the day: the vowels were all alike and the\nconsonants only distinguishable as turning up or down, the strokes had\na blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep the line—in short,\nit was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret when you\nknow beforehand what the writer means.As Caleb looked on, his visage showed a growing depression, but when\nFred handed him the paper he gave something like a snarl, and rapped\nthe paper passionately with the back of his hand. Bad work like this\ndispelled all Caleb’s mildness.“The deuce!” he exclaimed, snarlingly. “To think that this is a country\nwhere a man’s education may cost hundreds and hundreds, and it turns\nyou out this!” Then in a more pathetic tone, pushing up his spectacles\nand looking at the unfortunate scribe, “The Lord have mercy on us,\nFred, I can’t put up with this!”“What can I do, Mr. Garth?” said Fred, whose spirits had sunk very low,\nnot only at the estimate of his handwriting, but at the vision of\nhimself as liable to be ranked with office clerks.“Do? Why, you must learn to form your letters and keep the line. What’s\nthe use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?” asked Caleb,\nenergetically, quite preoccupied with the bad quality of the work. “Is\nthere so little business in the world that you must be sending puzzles\nover the country? But that’s the way people are brought up. I should\nlose no end of time with the letters some people send me, if Susan did\nnot make them out for me. It’s disgusting.” Here Caleb tossed the paper\nfrom him."

  "content": "Any stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered\nwhat was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the\nfine-looking young fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather\npatchy as he bit his lip with mortification. Fred was struggling with\nmany thoughts. Mr. Garth had been so kind and encouraging at the\nbeginning of their interview, that gratitude and hopefulness had been\nat a high pitch, and the downfall was proportionate. He had not thought\nof desk-work—in fact, like the majority of young gentlemen, he wanted\nan occupation which should be free from disagreeables. I cannot tell\nwhat might have been the consequences if he had not distinctly promised\nhimself that he would go to Lowick to see Mary and tell her that he was\nengaged to work under her father. He did not like to disappoint himself\nthere.“I am very sorry,” were all the words that he could muster. But Mr.\nGarth was already relenting.“We must make the best of it, Fred,” he began, with a return to his\nusual quiet tone. “Every man can learn to write. I taught myself. Go at\nit with a will, and sit up at night if the day-time isn’t enough. We’ll\nbe patient, my boy. Callum shall go on with the books for a bit, while\nyou are learning. But now I must be off,” said Caleb, rising. “You must\nlet your father know our agreement. You’ll save me Callum’s salary, you\nknow, when you can write; and I can afford to give you eighty pounds\nfor the first year, and more after.”When Fred made the necessary disclosure to his parents, the relative\neffect on the two was a surprise which entered very deeply into his\nmemory. He went straight from Mr. Garth’s office to the warehouse,\nrightly feeling that the most respectful way in which he could behave\nto his father was to make the painful communication as gravely and\nformally as possible. Moreover, the decision would be more certainly\nunderstood to be final, if the interview took place in his father’s\ngravest hours, which were always those spent in his private room at the\nwarehouse.Fred entered on the subject directly, and declared briefly what he had\ndone and was resolved to do, expressing at the end his regret that he\nshould be the cause of disappointment to his father, and taking the\nblame on his own deficiencies. The regret was genuine, and inspired\nFred with strong, simple words.Mr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an\nexclamation, a silence which in his impatient temperament was a sign of\nunusual emotion. He had not been in good spirits about trade that\nmorning, and the slight bitterness in his lips grew intense as he\nlistened. When Fred had ended, there was a pause of nearly a minute,\nduring which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his desk and turned the key\nemphatically. Then he looked at his son steadily, and said—"

You’ve thrown away your\neducation, and gone down a step in life, when I had given you the means\nof rising, that’s all.”“I am very sorry that we differ, father. I think I can be quite as much\nof a gentleman at the work I have undertaken, as if I had been a\ncurate. But I am grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me.”“Very well; I have no more to say. I wash my hands of you. I only hope,\nwhen you have a son of your own he will make a better return for the\npains you spend on him.”This was very cutting to Fred. His father was using that unfair\nadvantage possessed by us all when we are in a pathetic situation and\nsee our own past as if it were simply part of the pathos. In reality,\nMr. Vincy’s wishes about his son had had a great deal of pride,\ninconsiderateness, and egoistic folly in them. But still the\ndisappointed father held a strong lever; and Fred felt as if he were\nbeing banished with a malediction.“I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?” he said,\nafter rising to go; “I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my\nboard, as of course I should wish to do.”“Board be hanged!” said Mr. Vincy, recovering himself in his disgust at\nthe notion that Fred’s keep would be missed at his table. “Of course\nyour mother will want you to stay. But I shall keep no horse for you,\nyou understand; and you will pay your own tailor. You will do with a\nsuit or two less, I fancy, when you have to pay for ’em.”Fred lingered; there was still something to be said. At last it came.“I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the\nvexation I have caused you.”Mr. Vincy from his chair threw a quick glance upward at his son, who\nhad advanced near to him, and then gave his hand, saying hurriedly,\n“Yes, yes, let us say no more.”"

  "content": "Fred went through much more narrative and explanation with his mother,\nbut she was inconsolable, having before her eyes what perhaps her\nhusband had never thought of, the certainty that Fred would marry Mary\nGarth, that her life would henceforth be spoiled by a perpetual\ninfusion of Garths and their ways, and that her darling boy, with his\nbeautiful face and stylish air “beyond anybody else’s son in\nMiddlemarch,” would be sure to get like that family in plainness of\nappearance and carelessness about his clothes. To her it seemed that\nthere was a Garth conspiracy to get possession of the desirable Fred,\nbut she dared not enlarge on this opinion, because a slight hint of it\nhad made him “fly out” at her as he had never done before. Her temper\nwas too sweet for her to show any anger, but she felt that her\nhappiness had received a bruise, and for several days merely to look at\nFred made her cry a little as if he were the subject of some baleful\nprophecy. Perhaps she was the slower to recover her usual cheerfulness\nbecause Fred had warned her that she must not reopen the sore question\nwith his father, who had accepted his decision and forgiven him. If her\nhusband had been vehement against Fred, she would have been urged into\ndefence of her darling. It was the end of the fourth day when Mr. Vincy\nsaid to her—“Come, Lucy, my dear, don’t be so down-hearted. You always have spoiled\nthe boy, and you must go on spoiling him.”“Nothing ever did cut me so before, Vincy,” said the wife, her fair\nthroat and chin beginning to tremble again, “only his illness.”“Pooh, pooh, never mind! We must expect to have trouble with our\nchildren. Don’t make it worse by letting me see you out of spirits.”“Well, I won’t,” said Mrs. Vincy, roused by this appeal and adjusting\nherself with a little shake as of a bird which lays down its ruffled\nplumage.“It won’t do to begin making a fuss about one,” said Mr. Vincy, wishing\nto combine a little grumbling with domestic cheerfulness. “There’s\nRosamond as well as Fred.”“Yes, poor thing. I’m sure I felt for her being disappointed of her\nbaby; but she got over it nicely.”“Baby, pooh! I can see Lydgate is making a mess of his practice, and\ngetting into debt too, by what I hear. I shall have Rosamond coming to\nme with a pretty tale one of these days. But they’ll get no money from\nme, I know. Let _his_ family help him. I never did like that marriage.\nBut it’s no use talking. Ring the bell for lemons, and don’t look dull\nany more, Lucy.

  "content": "The evening that Fred Vincy walked to Lowick parsonage (he had begun to\nsee that this was a world in which even a spirited young man must\nsometimes walk for want of a horse to carry him) he set out at five\no’clock and called on Mrs. Garth by the way, wishing to assure himself\nthat she accepted their new relations willingly.He found the family group, dogs and cats included, under the great\napple-tree in the orchard. It was a festival with Mrs. Garth, for her\neldest son, Christy, her peculiar joy and pride, had come home for a\nshort holiday—Christy, who held it the most desirable thing in the\nworld to be a tutor, to study all literatures and be a regenerate\nPorson, and who was an incorporate criticism on poor Fred, a sort of\nobject-lesson given to him by the educational mother. Christy himself,\na square-browed, broad-shouldered masculine edition of his mother not\nmuch higher than Fred’s shoulder—which made it the harder that he\nshould be held superior—was always as simple as possible, and thought\nno more of Fred’s disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe’s,\nwishing that he himself were more of the same height. He was lying on\nthe ground now by his mother’s chair, with his straw hat laid flat over\nhis eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that\nbeloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many young\nlives. The volume was “Ivanhoe,” and Jim was in the great archery scene\nat the tournament, but suffered much interruption from Ben, who had\nfetched his own old bow and arrows, and was making himself dreadfully\ndisagreeable, Letty thought, by begging all present to observe his\nrandom shots, which no one wished to do except Brownie, the\nactive-minded but probably shallow mongrel, while the grizzled\nNewfoundland lying in the sun looked on with the dull-eyed neutrality\nof extreme old age. Letty herself, showing as to her mouth and pinafore\nsome slight signs that she had been assisting at the gathering of the\ncherries which stood in a coral-heap on the tea-table, was now seated\non the grass, listening open-eyed to the reading."

When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he said that he was on\nhis way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his bow, and\nsnatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode across Fred’s\noutstretched leg, and said “Take me!”“Oh, and me too,” said Letty.“You can’t keep up with Fred and me,” said Ben.“Yes, I can. Mother, please say that I am to go,” urged Letty, whose\nlife was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as a girl.“I shall stay with Christy,” observed Jim; as much as to say that he\nhad the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put her hand up\nto her head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the\nother.“Let us all go and see Mary,” said Christy, opening his arms.“No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage. And\nthat old Glasgow suit of yours would never do. Besides, your father\nwill come home. We must let Fred go alone. He can tell Mary that you\nare here, and she will come back to-morrow.”Christy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred’s\nbeautiful white trousers. Certainly Fred’s tailoring suggested the\nadvantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even of\nlooking warm and of pushing his hair back with his handkerchief.“Children, run away,” said Mrs. Garth; “it is too warm to hang about\nyour friends. Take your brother and show him the rabbits.”The eldest understood, and led off the children immediately. Fred felt\nthat Mrs. Garth wished to give him an opportunity of saying anything he\nhad to say, but he could only begin by observing—“How glad you must be to have Christy here!”“Yes; he has come sooner than I expected. He got down from the coach at\nnine o’clock, just after his father went out. I am longing for Caleb to\ncome and hear what wonderful progress Christy is making. He has paid\nhis expenses for the last year by giving lessons, carrying on hard\nstudy at the same time. He hopes soon to get a private tutorship and go\nabroad.”“He is a great fellow,” said Fred, to whom these cheerful truths had a\nmedicinal taste, “and no trouble to anybody.” After a slight pause, he\nadded, “But I fear you will think that I am going to be a great deal of\ntrouble to Mr. Garth.”"

She was knitting, and could either look at Fred or not, as she\nchose—always an advantage when one is bent on loading speech with\nsalutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth intended to be duly reserved,\nshe did wish to say something that Fred might be the better for.“I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good\nreason,” said Fred, his spirit rising a little at the perception of\nsomething like a disposition to lecture him. “I happen to have behaved\njust the worst to the people I can’t help wishing for the most from.\nBut while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother have not given me\nup, I don’t see why I should give myself up.” Fred thought it might be\nwell to suggest these masculine examples to Mrs. Garth.“Assuredly,” said she, with gathering emphasis. “A young man for whom\ntwo such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he\nthrew himself away and made their sacrifices vain.”Fred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said, “I hope\nit will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement\nto believe that I may win Mary. Mr. Garth has told you about that? You\nwere not surprised, I dare say?” Fred ended, innocently referring only\nto his own love as probably evident enough.“Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?” returned Mrs.\nGarth, who thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive to the\nfact that Mary’s friends could not possibly have wished this\nbeforehand, whatever the Vincys might suppose. “Yes, I confess I was\nsurprised.”“She never did give me any—not the least in the world, when I talked to\nher myself,” said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. “But when I asked Mr.\nFarebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a\nhope.”"

  "content": "The power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth had not\nyet discharged itself. It was a little too provoking even for _her_\nself-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the\ndisappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a\nnightingale and never knowing it—and that all the while his family\nshould suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her\nvexation had fermented the more actively because of its total\nrepression towards her husband. Exemplary wives will sometimes find\nscapegoats in this way. She now said with energetic decision, “You made\na great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you.”“Did I?” said Fred, reddening instantaneously. He was alarmed, but at a\nloss to know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an apologetic tone,\n“Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of ours; and Mary, I\nknew, would listen to him gravely; and he took it on himself quite\nreadily.”“Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own\nwishes, and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,” said\nMrs. Garth. She did not mean to go beyond this salutary general\ndoctrine, and threw her indignation into a needless unwinding of her\nworsted, knitting her brow at it with a grand air.“I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,” said\nFred, who nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were beginning\nto form themselves.“Precisely; you cannot conceive,” said Mrs. Garth, cutting her words as\nneatly as possible.For a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and\nthen turning with a quick movement said almost sharply—“Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with\nMary?”“And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to\nbe surprised,” returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting down beside her\nand folding her arms. It was an unwonted sign of emotion in her that\nshe should put her work out of her hands. In fact her feelings were\ndivided between the satisfaction of giving Fred his discipline and the\nsense of having gone a little too far. Fred took his hat and stick and\nrose quickly.“Then you think I am standing in his way, and in Mary’s too?” he said,\nin a tone which seemed to demand an answer."

She had brought herself into\nthe unpleasant position of being called on to say what she really felt,\nyet what she knew there were strong reasons for concealing. And to her\nthe consciousness of having exceeded in words was peculiarly\nmortifying. Besides, Fred had given out unexpected electricity, and he\nnow added, “Mr. Garth seemed pleased that Mary should be attached to\nme. He could not have known anything of this.”Mrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her husband, the\nfear that Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily\nendurable. She answered, wanting to check unintended consequences—“I spoke from inference only. I am not aware that Mary knows anything\nof the matter.”But she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a subject\nwhich she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop\nin that way; and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of\nunintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things\nstood. Ben, bouncing across the grass with Brownie at his heels, and\nseeing the kitten dragging the knitting by a lengthening line of wool,\nshouted and clapped his hands; Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate,\njumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then jumped down again and\nswept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted\nsock-top, fitted it over the kitten’s head as a new source of madness,\nwhile Letty arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty—it\nwas a history as full of sensation as “This is the house that Jack\nbuilt.” Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came\nup and the _tête-à-tête_ with Fred was ended. He got away as soon as he\ncould, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her\nseverity by saying “God bless you” when she shook hands with him.She was unpleasantly conscious that she had been on the verge of\nspeaking as “one of the foolish women speaketh”—telling first and\nentreating silence after. But she had not entreated silence, and to\nprevent Caleb’s blame she determined to blame herself and confess all\nto him that very night.

  "content": "No doubt it was having a strong effect on him as he walked to Lowick.\nFred’s light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much of a bruise\nas from this suggestion that if he had been out of the way Mary might\nhave made a thoroughly good match. Also he was piqued that he had been\nwhat he called such a stupid lout as to ask that intervention from Mr.\nFarebrother. But it was not in a lover’s nature—it was not in Fred’s,\nthat the new anxiety raised about Mary’s feeling should not surmount\nevery other. Notwithstanding his trust in Mr. Farebrother’s generosity,\nnotwithstanding what Mary had said to him, Fred could not help feeling\nthat he had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he objected to it\nextremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary for her good,\nbeing ready rather to fight for her with any man whatsoever. But the\nfighting with Mr. Farebrother must be of a metaphorical kind, which was\nmuch more difficult to Fred than the muscular. Certainly this\nexperience was a discipline for Fred hardly less sharp than his\ndisappointment about his uncle’s will. The iron had not entered into\nhis soul, but he had begun to imagine what the sharp edge would be. It\ndid not once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth might be mistaken about Mr.\nFarebrother, but he suspected that she might be wrong about Mary. Mary\nhad been staying at the parsonage lately, and her mother might know\nvery little of what had been passing in her mind.He did not feel easier when he found her looking cheerful with the\nthree ladies in the drawing-room. They were in animated discussion on\nsome subject which was dropped when he entered, and Mary was copying\nthe labels from a heap of shallow cabinet drawers, in a minute\nhandwriting which she was skilled in. Mr. Farebrother was somewhere in\nthe village, and the three ladies knew nothing of Fred’s peculiar\nrelation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to propose that\nthey should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself that\nhe should have to go away without saying a word to her in private. He\ntold her first of Christy’s arrival and then of his own engagement with\nher father; and he was comforted by seeing that this latter news\ntouched her keenly. She said hurriedly, “I am so glad,” and then bent\nover her writing to hinder any one from noticing her face. But here was\na subject which Mrs. Farebrother could not let pass.“You don’t mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear of a\nyoung man giving up the Church for which he was educated: you only mean\nthat things being so, you are glad that he should be under an excellent\nman like your father.”“No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,” said Mary,\ncleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear. “I have a dreadfully\nsecular mind. I never liked any clergyman except the Vicar of Wakefield\nand Mr. Farebrother.”“Now why, my dear?” said Mrs. Farebrother, pausing on her large wooden\nknitting-needles and looking at Mary. “You have always a good reason\nfor your opinions, but this astonishes me. Of course I put out of the\nquestion those who preach new doctrine. But why should you dislike\nclergymen?”“Oh dear,” said Mary, her face breaking into merriment as she seemed to\nconsider a moment, “I don’t like their neckcloths.”“Why, you don’t like Camden’s, then,” said Miss Winifred, in some\nanxiety."

You would have better reasons than these for\nslighting so respectable a class of men,” said Mrs. Farebrother,\nmajestically.“Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be that it is\ndifficult to satisfy her,” said Fred.“Well, I am glad at least that she makes an exception in favor of my\nson,” said the old lady.Mary was wondering at Fred’s piqued tone, when Mr. Farebrother came in\nand had to hear the news about the engagement under Mr. Garth. At the\nend he said with quiet satisfaction, “_That_ is right;” and then bent\nto look at Mary’s labels and praise her handwriting. Fred felt horribly\njealous—was glad, of course, that Mr. Farebrother was so estimable, but\nwished that he had been ugly and fat as men at forty sometimes are. It\nwas clear what the end would be, since Mary openly placed Farebrother\nabove everybody, and these women were all evidently encouraging the\naffair. He was feeling sure that he should have no chance of speaking\nto Mary, when Mr. Farebrother said—“Fred, help me to carry these drawers back into my study—you have never\nseen my fine new study. Pray come too, Miss Garth. I want you to see a\nstupendous spider I found this morning.”Mary at once saw the Vicar’s intention. He had never since the\nmemorable evening deviated from his old pastoral kindness towards her,\nand her momentary wonder and doubt had quite gone to sleep. Mary was\naccustomed to think rather rigorously of what was probable, and if a\nbelief flattered her vanity she felt warned to dismiss it as\nridiculous, having early had much exercise in such dismissals. It was\nas she had foreseen: when Fred had been asked to admire the fittings of\nthe study, and she had been asked to admire the spider, Mr. Farebrother\nsaid—"

Nevertheless, the first word Fred said to Mary\nwas—“It is of no use, whatever I do, Mary. You are sure to marry\nFarebrother at last.” There was some rage in his tone.“What do you mean, Fred?” Mary exclaimed indignantly, blushing deeply,\nand surprised out of all her readiness in reply.“It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly enough—you who\nsee everything.”“I only see that you are behaving very ill, Fred, in speaking so of Mr.\nFarebrother after he has pleaded your cause in every way. How can you\nhave taken up such an idea?”Fred was rather deep, in spite of his irritation. If Mary had really\nbeen unsuspicious, there was no good in telling her what Mrs. Garth had\nsaid.“It follows as a matter of course,” he replied. “When you are\ncontinually seeing a man who beats me in everything, and whom you set\nup above everybody, I can have no fair chance.”“You are very ungrateful, Fred,” said Mary. “I wish I had never told\nMr. Farebrother that I cared for you in the least.”“No, I am not ungrateful; I should be the happiest fellow in the world\nif it were not for this. I told your father everything, and he was very\nkind; he treated me as if I were his son. I could go at the work with a\nwill, writing and everything, if it were not for this.”“For this? for what?” said Mary, imagining now that something specific\nmust have been said or done.“This dreadful certainty that I shall be bowled out by Farebrother.”\nMary was appeased by her inclination to laugh.“Fred,” she said, peeping round to catch his eyes, which were sulkily\nturned away from her, “you are too delightfully ridiculous. If you were\nnot such a charming simpleton, what a temptation this would be to play\nthe wicked coquette, and let you suppose that somebody besides you has\nmade love to me.”“Do you really like me best, Mary?” said Fred, turning eyes full of\naffection on her, and trying to take her hand."

And that is no argument that a very wise man\never will,” she ended, merrily.“I wish you would tell me that you could not possibly ever think of\nhim,” said Fred.“Never dare to mention this any more to me, Fred,” said Mary, getting\nserious again. “I don’t know whether it is more stupid or ungenerous in\nyou not to see that Mr. Farebrother has left us together on purpose\nthat we might speak freely. I am disappointed that you should be so\nblind to his delicate feeling.”There was no time to say any more before Mr. Farebrother came back with\nthe engraving; and Fred had to return to the drawing-room still with a\njealous dread in his heart, but yet with comforting arguments from\nMary’s words and manner. The result of the conversation was on the\nwhole more painful to Mary: inevitably her attention had taken a new\nattitude, and she saw the possibility of new interpretations. She was\nin a position in which she seemed to herself to be slighting Mr.\nFarebrother, and this, in relation to a man who is much honored, is\nalways dangerous to the firmness of a grateful woman. To have a reason\nfor going home the next day was a relief, for Mary earnestly desired to\nbe always clear that she loved Fred best. When a tender affection has\nbeen storing itself in us through many of our years, the idea that we\ncould accept any exchange for it seems to be a cheapening of our lives.\nAnd we can set a watch over our affections and our constancy as we can\nover other treasures.“Fred has lost all his other expectations; he must keep this,” Mary\nsaid to herself, with a smile curling her lips. It was impossible to\nhelp fleeting visions of another kind—new dignities and an acknowledged\nvalue of which she had often felt the absence. But these things with\nFred outside them, Fred forsaken and looking sad for the want of her,\ncould never tempt her deliberate thought.CHAPTER LVIII."

  "content": "What led her particularly to desire horse-exercise was a visit from\nCaptain Lydgate, the baronet’s third son, who, I am sorry to say, was\ndetested by our Tertius of that name as a vapid fop “parting his hair\nfrom brow to nape in a despicable fashion” (not followed by Tertius\nhimself), and showing an ignorant security that he knew the proper\nthing to say on every topic. Lydgate inwardly cursed his own folly that\nhe had drawn down this visit by consenting to go to his uncle’s on the\nwedding-tour, and he made himself rather disagreeable to Rosamond by\nsaying so in private. For to Rosamond this visit was a source of\nunprecedented but gracefully concealed exultation. She was so intensely\nconscious of having a cousin who was a baronet’s son staying in the\nhouse, that she imagined the knowledge of what was implied by his\npresence to be diffused through all other minds; and when she\nintroduced Captain Lydgate to her guests, she had a placid sense that\nhis rank penetrated them as if it had been an odor. The satisfaction\nwas enough for the time to melt away some disappointment in the\nconditions of marriage with a medical man even of good birth: it seemed\nnow that her marriage was visibly as well as ideally floating her above\nthe Middlemarch level, and the future looked bright with letters and\nvisits to and from Quallingham, and vague advancement in consequence\nfor Tertius. Especially as, probably at the Captain’s suggestion, his\nmarried sister, Mrs. Mengan, had come with her maid, and stayed two\nnights on her way from town. Hence it was clearly worth while for\nRosamond to take pains with her music and the careful selection of her\nlace.As to Captain Lydgate himself, his low brow, his aquiline nose bent on\none side, and his rather heavy utterance, might have been\ndisadvantageous in any young gentleman who had not a military bearing\nand mustache to give him what is doted on by some flower-like blond\nheads as “style.” He had, moreover, that sort of high-breeding which\nconsists in being free from the petty solicitudes of middle-class\ngentility, and he was a great critic of feminine charms. Rosamond\ndelighted in his admiration now even more than she had done at\nQuallingham, and he found it easy to spend several hours of the day in\nflirting with her. The visit altogether was one of the pleasantest\nlarks he had ever had, not the less so perhaps because he suspected\nthat his queer cousin Tertius wished him away: though Lydgate, who\nwould rather (hyperbolically speaking) have died than have failed in\npolite hospitality, suppressed his dislike, and only pretended\ngenerally not to hear what the gallant officer said, consigning the\ntask of answering him to Rosamond. For he was not at all a jealous\nhusband, and preferred leaving a feather-headed young gentleman alone\nwith his wife to bearing him company.“I wish you would talk more to the Captain at dinner, Tertius,” said\nRosamond, one evening when the important guest was gone to Loamford to\nsee some brother officers stationed there. “You really look so absent\nsometimes—you seem to be seeing through his head into something behind\nit, instead of looking at him.”“My dear Rosy, you don’t expect me to talk much to such a conceited ass\nas that, I hope,” said Lydgate, brusquely. “If he got his head broken,\nI might look at it with interest, not before.”“I cannot conceive why you should speak of your cousin so\ncontemptuously,” said Rosamond, her fingers moving at her work while\nshe spoke with a mild gravity which had a touch of disdain in it."

Ladislaw has almost forsaken the house since he came.”Rosamond thought she knew perfectly well why Mr. Ladislaw disliked the\nCaptain: he was jealous, and she liked his being jealous.“It is impossible to say what will suit eccentric persons,” she\nanswered, “but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough gentleman,\nand I think you ought not, out of respect to Sir Godwin, to treat him\nwith neglect.”“No, dear; but we have had dinners for him. And he comes in and goes\nout as he likes. He doesn’t want me.”“Still, when he is in the room, you might show him more attention. He\nmay not be a phoenix of cleverness in your sense; his profession is\ndifferent; but it would be all the better for you to talk a little on\nhis subjects. _I_ think his conversation is quite agreeable. And he is\nanything but an unprincipled man.”“The fact is, you would wish me to be a little more like him, Rosy,”\nsaid Lydgate, in a sort of resigned murmur, with a smile which was not\nexactly tender, and certainly not merry. Rosamond was silent and did\nnot smile again; but the lovely curves of her face looked good-tempered\nenough without smiling.Those words of Lydgate’s were like a sad milestone marking how far he\nhad travelled from his old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared\nto be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her husband’s\nmind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and\nlooking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored\nwisdom alone. He had begun to distinguish between that imagined\nadoration and the attraction towards a man’s talent because it gives\nhim prestige, and is like an order in his button-hole or an Honorable\nbefore his name."

  "content": "It might have been supposed that Rosamond had travelled too, since she\nhad found the pointless conversation of Mr. Ned Plymdale perfectly\nwearisome; but to most mortals there is a stupidity which is\nunendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable—else,\nindeed, what would become of social bonds? Captain Lydgate’s stupidity\nwas delicately scented, carried itself with “style,” talked with a good\naccent, and was closely related to Sir Godwin. Rosamond found it quite\nagreeable and caught many of its phrases.Therefore since Rosamond, as we know, was fond of horseback, there were\nplenty of reasons why she should be tempted to resume her riding when\nCaptain Lydgate, who had ordered his man with two horses to follow him\nand put up at the “Green Dragon,” begged her to go out on the gray\nwhich he warranted to be gentle and trained to carry a lady—indeed, he\nhad bought it for his sister, and was taking it to Quallingham.\nRosamond went out the first time without telling her husband, and came\nback before his return; but the ride had been so thorough a success,\nand she declared herself so much the better in consequence, that he was\ninformed of it with full reliance on his consent that she should go\nriding again.On the contrary Lydgate was more than hurt—he was utterly confounded\nthat she had risked herself on a strange horse without referring the\nmatter to his wish. After the first almost thundering exclamations of\nastonishment, which sufficiently warned Rosamond of what was coming, he\nwas silent for some moments.“However, you have come back safely,” he said, at last, in a decisive\ntone. “You will not go again, Rosy; that is understood. If it were the\nquietest, most familiar horse in the world, there would always be the\nchance of accident. And you know very well that I wished you to give up\nriding the roan on that account.”“But there is the chance of accident indoors, Tertius.”“My darling, don’t talk nonsense,” said Lydgate, in an imploring tone;\n“surely I am the person to judge for you. I think it is enough that I\nsay you are not to go again.”Rosamond was arranging her hair before dinner, and the reflection of\nher head in the glass showed no change in its loveliness except a\nlittle turning aside of the long neck. Lydgate had been moving about\nwith his hands in his pockets, and now paused near her, as if he\nawaited some assurance."

Lydgate had often fastened the plaits\nbefore, being among the deftest of men with his large finely formed\nfingers. He swept up the soft festoons of plaits and fastened in the\ntall comb (to such uses do men come!); and what could he do then but\nkiss the exquisite nape which was shown in all its delicate curves? But\nwhen we do what we have done before, it is often with a difference.\nLydgate was still angry, and had not forgotten his point.“I shall tell the Captain that he ought to have known better than offer\nyou his horse,” he said, as he moved away.“I beg you will not do anything of the kind, Tertius,” said Rosamond,\nlooking at him with something more marked than usual in her speech. “It\nwill be treating me as if I were a child. Promise that you will leave\nthe subject to me.”There did seem to be some truth in her objection. Lydgate said, “Very\nwell,” with a surly obedience, and thus the discussion ended with his\npromising Rosamond, and not with her promising him.In fact, she had been determined not to promise. Rosamond had that\nvictorious obstinacy which never wastes its energy in impetuous\nresistance. What she liked to do was to her the right thing, and all\nher cleverness was directed to getting the means of doing it. She meant\nto go out riding again on the gray, and she did go on the next\nopportunity of her husband’s absence, not intending that he should know\nuntil it was late enough not to signify to her. The temptation was\ncertainly great: she was very fond of the exercise, and the\ngratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir\nGodwin’s son, on another fine horse by her side, and of being met in\nthis position by any one but her husband, was something as good as her\ndreams before marriage: moreover she was riveting the connection with\nthe family at Quallingham, which must be a wise thing to do.But the gentle gray, unprepared for the crash of a tree that was being\nfelled on the edge of Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a worse\nfright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her baby. Lydgate\ncould not show his anger towards her, but he was rather bearish to the\nCaptain, whose visit naturally soon came to an end."

There was gathering\nwithin him an amazed sense of his powerlessness over Rosamond. His\nsuperior knowledge and mental force, instead of being, as he had\nimagined, a shrine to consult on all occasions, was simply set aside on\nevery practical question. He had regarded Rosamond’s cleverness as\nprecisely of the receptive kind which became a woman. He was now\nbeginning to find out what that cleverness was—what was the shape into\nwhich it had run as into a close network aloof and independent. No one\nquicker than Rosamond to see causes and effects which lay within the\ntrack of her own tastes and interests: she had seen clearly Lydgate’s\npreeminence in Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively\ntracing still more agreeable social effects when his talent should have\nadvanced him; but for her, his professional and scientific ambition had\nno other relation to these desirable effects than if they had been the\nfortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil. And that oil apart, with\nwhich she had nothing to do, of course she believed in her own opinion\nmore than she did in his. Lydgate was astounded to find in numberless\ntrifling matters, as well as in this last serious case of the riding,\nthat affection did not make her compliant. He had no doubt that the\naffection was there, and had no presentiment that he had done anything\nto repel it. For his own part he said to himself that he loved her as\ntenderly as ever, and could make up his mind to her negations;\nbut—well! Lydgate was much worried, and conscious of new elements in\nhis life as noxious to him as an inlet of mud to a creature that has\nbeen used to breathe and bathe and dart after its illuminated prey in\nthe clearest of waters."

These latter states of\nmind had one cause amongst others, which he had generously but\nmistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it should affect her\nhealth and spirits. Between him and her indeed there was that total\nmissing of each other’s mental track, which is too evidently possible\neven between persons who are continually thinking of each other. To\nLydgate it seemed that he had been spending month after month in\nsacrificing more than half of his best intent and best power to his\ntenderness for Rosamond; bearing her little claims and interruptions\nwithout impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of\nbitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the\nblank unreflecting surface her mind presented to his ardor for the more\nimpersonal ends of his profession and his scientific study, an ardor\nwhich he had fancied that the ideal wife must somehow worship as\nsublime, though not in the least knowing why. But his endurance was\nmingled with a self-discontent which, if we know how to be candid, we\nshall confess to make more than half our bitterness under grievances,\nwife or husband included. It always remains true that if we had been\ngreater, circumstance would have been less strong against us. Lydgate\nwas aware that his concessions to Rosamond were often little more than\nthe lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping paralysis apt to seize\nan enthusiasm which is out of adjustment to a constant portion of our\nlives. And on Lydgate’s enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a\nsimple weight of sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading\ncare, such as casts the blight of irony over all higher effort."
