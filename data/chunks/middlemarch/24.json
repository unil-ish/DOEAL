  "content": "“Ask Ladislaw if he doesn’t think your Captain the greatest bore he\never met with. Ladislaw has almost forsaken the house since he came.”Rosamond thought she knew perfectly well why Mr. Ladislaw disliked the\nCaptain: he was jealous, and she liked his being jealous.“It is impossible to say what will suit eccentric persons,” she\nanswered, “but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough gentleman,\nand I think you ought not, out of respect to Sir Godwin, to treat him\nwith neglect.”“No, dear; but we have had dinners for him. And he comes in and goes\nout as he likes. He doesn’t want me.”“Still, when he is in the room, you might show him more attention. He\nmay not be a phoenix of cleverness in your sense; his profession is\ndifferent; but it would be all the better for you to talk a little on\nhis subjects. _I_ think his conversation is quite agreeable. And he is\nanything but an unprincipled man.”“The fact is, you would wish me to be a little more like him, Rosy,”\nsaid Lydgate, in a sort of resigned murmur, with a smile which was not\nexactly tender, and certainly not merry. Rosamond was silent and did\nnot smile again; but the lovely curves of her face looked good-tempered\nenough without smiling.Those words of Lydgate’s were like a sad milestone marking how far he\nhad travelled from his old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared\nto be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her husband’s\nmind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and\nlooking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored\nwisdom alone. He had begun to distinguish between that imagined\nadoration and the attraction towards a man’s talent because it gives\nhim prestige, and is like an order in his button-hole or an Honorable\nbefore his name."

  "content": "It might have been supposed that Rosamond had travelled too, since she\nhad found the pointless conversation of Mr. Ned Plymdale perfectly\nwearisome; but to most mortals there is a stupidity which is\nunendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable—else,\nindeed, what would become of social bonds? Captain Lydgate’s stupidity\nwas delicately scented, carried itself with “style,” talked with a good\naccent, and was closely related to Sir Godwin. Rosamond found it quite\nagreeable and caught many of its phrases.Therefore since Rosamond, as we know, was fond of horseback, there were\nplenty of reasons why she should be tempted to resume her riding when\nCaptain Lydgate, who had ordered his man with two horses to follow him\nand put up at the “Green Dragon,” begged her to go out on the gray\nwhich he warranted to be gentle and trained to carry a lady—indeed, he\nhad bought it for his sister, and was taking it to Quallingham.\nRosamond went out the first time without telling her husband, and came\nback before his return; but the ride had been so thorough a success,\nand she declared herself so much the better in consequence, that he was\ninformed of it with full reliance on his consent that she should go\nriding again.On the contrary Lydgate was more than hurt—he was utterly confounded\nthat she had risked herself on a strange horse without referring the\nmatter to his wish. After the first almost thundering exclamations of\nastonishment, which sufficiently warned Rosamond of what was coming, he\nwas silent for some moments.“However, you have come back safely,” he said, at last, in a decisive\ntone. “You will not go again, Rosy; that is understood. If it were the\nquietest, most familiar horse in the world, there would always be the\nchance of accident. And you know very well that I wished you to give up\nriding the roan on that account.”“But there is the chance of accident indoors, Tertius.”“My darling, don’t talk nonsense,” said Lydgate, in an imploring tone;\n“surely I am the person to judge for you. I think it is enough that I\nsay you are not to go again.”Rosamond was arranging her hair before dinner, and the reflection of\nher head in the glass showed no change in its loveliness except a\nlittle turning aside of the long neck. Lydgate had been moving about\nwith his hands in his pockets, and now paused near her, as if he\nawaited some assurance."

  "content": "“I wish you would fasten up my plaits, dear,” said Rosamond, letting\nher arms fall with a little sigh, so as to make a husband ashamed of\nstanding there like a brute. Lydgate had often fastened the plaits\nbefore, being among the deftest of men with his large finely formed\nfingers. He swept up the soft festoons of plaits and fastened in the\ntall comb (to such uses do men come!); and what could he do then but\nkiss the exquisite nape which was shown in all its delicate curves? But\nwhen we do what we have done before, it is often with a difference.\nLydgate was still angry, and had not forgotten his point.“I shall tell the Captain that he ought to have known better than offer\nyou his horse,” he said, as he moved away.“I beg you will not do anything of the kind, Tertius,” said Rosamond,\nlooking at him with something more marked than usual in her speech. “It\nwill be treating me as if I were a child. Promise that you will leave\nthe subject to me.”There did seem to be some truth in her objection. Lydgate said, “Very\nwell,” with a surly obedience, and thus the discussion ended with his\npromising Rosamond, and not with her promising him.In fact, she had been determined not to promise. Rosamond had that\nvictorious obstinacy which never wastes its energy in impetuous\nresistance. What she liked to do was to her the right thing, and all\nher cleverness was directed to getting the means of doing it. She meant\nto go out riding again on the gray, and she did go on the next\nopportunity of her husband’s absence, not intending that he should know\nuntil it was late enough not to signify to her. The temptation was\ncertainly great: she was very fond of the exercise, and the\ngratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir\nGodwin’s son, on another fine horse by her side, and of being met in\nthis position by any one but her husband, was something as good as her\ndreams before marriage: moreover she was riveting the connection with\nthe family at Quallingham, which must be a wise thing to do.But the gentle gray, unprepared for the crash of a tree that was being\nfelled on the edge of Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a worse\nfright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her baby. Lydgate\ncould not show his anger towards her, but he was rather bearish to the\nCaptain, whose visit naturally soon came to an end."

  "content": "In all future conversations on the subject, Rosamond was mildly certain\nthat the ride had made no difference, and that if she had stayed at\nhome the same symptoms would have come on and would have ended in the\nsame way, because she had felt something like them before.Lydgate could only say, “Poor, poor darling!”—but he secretly wondered\nover the terrible tenacity of this mild creature. There was gathering\nwithin him an amazed sense of his powerlessness over Rosamond. His\nsuperior knowledge and mental force, instead of being, as he had\nimagined, a shrine to consult on all occasions, was simply set aside on\nevery practical question. He had regarded Rosamond’s cleverness as\nprecisely of the receptive kind which became a woman. He was now\nbeginning to find out what that cleverness was—what was the shape into\nwhich it had run as into a close network aloof and independent. No one\nquicker than Rosamond to see causes and effects which lay within the\ntrack of her own tastes and interests: she had seen clearly Lydgate’s\npreeminence in Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively\ntracing still more agreeable social effects when his talent should have\nadvanced him; but for her, his professional and scientific ambition had\nno other relation to these desirable effects than if they had been the\nfortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil. And that oil apart, with\nwhich she had nothing to do, of course she believed in her own opinion\nmore than she did in his. Lydgate was astounded to find in numberless\ntrifling matters, as well as in this last serious case of the riding,\nthat affection did not make her compliant. He had no doubt that the\naffection was there, and had no presentiment that he had done anything\nto repel it. For his own part he said to himself that he loved her as\ntenderly as ever, and could make up his mind to her negations;\nbut—well! Lydgate was much worried, and conscious of new elements in\nhis life as noxious to him as an inlet of mud to a creature that has\nbeen used to breathe and bathe and dart after its illuminated prey in\nthe clearest of waters."

  "content": "Lydgate, relieved from anxiety about her, relapsed into what she\ninwardly called his moodiness—a name which to her covered his\nthoughtful preoccupation with other subjects than herself, as well as\nthat uneasy look of the brow and distaste for all ordinary things as if\nthey were mixed with bitter herbs, which really made a sort of\nweather-glass to his vexation and foreboding. These latter states of\nmind had one cause amongst others, which he had generously but\nmistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it should affect her\nhealth and spirits. Between him and her indeed there was that total\nmissing of each other’s mental track, which is too evidently possible\neven between persons who are continually thinking of each other. To\nLydgate it seemed that he had been spending month after month in\nsacrificing more than half of his best intent and best power to his\ntenderness for Rosamond; bearing her little claims and interruptions\nwithout impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of\nbitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the\nblank unreflecting surface her mind presented to his ardor for the more\nimpersonal ends of his profession and his scientific study, an ardor\nwhich he had fancied that the ideal wife must somehow worship as\nsublime, though not in the least knowing why. But his endurance was\nmingled with a self-discontent which, if we know how to be candid, we\nshall confess to make more than half our bitterness under grievances,\nwife or husband included. It always remains true that if we had been\ngreater, circumstance would have been less strong against us. Lydgate\nwas aware that his concessions to Rosamond were often little more than\nthe lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping paralysis apt to seize\nan enthusiasm which is out of adjustment to a constant portion of our\nlives. And on Lydgate’s enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a\nsimple weight of sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading\ncare, such as casts the blight of irony over all higher effort."

  "content": "This was the care which he had hitherto abstained from mentioning to\nRosamond; and he believed, with some wonder, that it had never entered\nher mind, though certainly no difficulty could be less mysterious. It\nwas an inference with a conspicuous handle to it, and had been easily\ndrawn by indifferent observers, that Lydgate was in debt; and he could\nnot succeed in keeping out of his mind for long together that he was\nevery day getting deeper into that swamp, which tempts men towards it\nwith such a pretty covering of flowers and verdure. It is wonderful how\nsoon a man gets up to his chin there—in a condition in which, in spite\nof himself, he is forced to think chiefly of release, though he had a\nscheme of the universe in his soul.Eighteen months ago Lydgate was poor, but had never known the eager\nwant of small sums, and felt rather a burning contempt for any one who\ndescended a step in order to gain them. He was now experiencing\nsomething worse than a simple deficit: he was assailed by the vulgar\nhateful trials of a man who has bought and used a great many things\nwhich might have been done without, and which he is unable to pay for,\nthough the demand for payment has become pressing."

  "content": "How this came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic or\nknowledge of prices. When a man in setting up a house and preparing for\nmarriage finds that his furniture and other initial expenses come to\nbetween four and five hundred pounds more than he has capital to pay\nfor; when at the end of a year it appears that his household expenses,\nhorses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a thousand, while the proceeds\nof the practice reckoned from the old books to be worth eight hundred\nper annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five hundred,\nchiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he\nminds it or not, he is in debt. Those were less expensive times than\nour own, and provincial life was comparatively modest; but the ease\nwith which a medical man who had lately bought a practice, who thought\nthat he was obliged to keep two horses, whose table was supplied\nwithout stint, and who paid an insurance on his life and a high rent\nfor house and garden, might find his expenses doubling his receipts,\ncan be conceived by any one who does not think these details beneath\nhis consideration. Rosamond, accustomed from her childhood to an\nextravagant household, thought that good housekeeping consisted simply\nin ordering the best of everything—nothing else “answered;” and Lydgate\nsupposed that “if things were done at all, they must be done\nproperly”—he did not see how they were to live otherwise. If each head\nof household expenditure had been mentioned to him beforehand, he would\nhave probably observed that “it could hardly come to much,” and if any\none had suggested a saving on a particular article—for example, the\nsubstitution of cheap fish for dear—it would have appeared to him\nsimply a penny-wise, mean notion. Rosamond, even without such an\noccasion as Captain Lydgate’s visit, was fond of giving invitations,\nand Lydgate, though he often thought the guests tiresome, did not\ninterfere. This sociability seemed a necessary part of professional\nprudence, and the entertainment must be suitable. It is true Lydgate\nwas constantly visiting the homes of the poor and adjusting his\nprescriptions of diet to their small means; but, dear me! has it not by\nthis time ceased to be remarkable—is it not rather that we expect in\nmen, that they should have numerous strands of experience lying side by\nside and never compare them with each other? Expenditure—like ugliness\nand errors—becomes a totally new thing when we attach our own\npersonality to it, and measure it by that wide difference which is\nmanifest (in our own sensations) between ourselves and others. Lydgate\nbelieved himself to be careless about his dress, and he despised a man\nwho calculated the effects of his costume; it seemed to him only a\nmatter of course that he had abundance of fresh garments—such things\nwere naturally ordered in sheaves. It must be remembered that he had\nnever hitherto felt the check of importunate debt, and he walked by\nhabit, not by self-criticism. But the check had come."

  "content": "Its novelty made it the more irritating. He was amazed, disgusted that\nconditions so foreign to all his purposes, so hatefully disconnected\nwith the objects he cared to occupy himself with, should have lain in\nambush and clutched him when he was unaware. And there was not only the\nactual debt; there was the certainty that in his present position he\nmust go on deepening it. Two furnishing tradesmen at Brassing, whose\nbills had been incurred before his marriage, and whom uncalculated\ncurrent expenses had ever since prevented him from paying, had\nrepeatedly sent him unpleasant letters which had forced themselves on\nhis attention. This could hardly have been more galling to any\ndisposition than to Lydgate’s, with his intense pride—his dislike of\nasking a favor or being under an obligation to any one. He had scorned\neven to form conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters,\nand nothing but extremity could have induced him to apply to his\nfather-in-law, even if he had not been made aware in various indirect\nways since his marriage that Mr. Vincy’s own affairs were not\nflourishing, and that the expectation of help from him would be\nresented. Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it had\nnever in the former part of his life occurred to Lydgate that he should\nneed to do so: he had never thought what borrowing would be to him; but\nnow that the idea had entered his mind, he felt that he would rather\nincur any other hardship. In the mean time he had no money or prospects\nof money; and his practice was not getting more lucrative."

  "content": "No wonder that Lydgate had been unable to suppress all signs of inward\ntrouble during the last few months, and now that Rosamond was regaining\nbrilliant health, he meditated taking her entirely into confidence on\nhis difficulties. New conversance with tradesmen’s bills had forced his\nreasoning into a new channel of comparison: he had begun to consider\nfrom a new point of view what was necessary and unnecessary in goods\nordered, and to see that there must be some change of habits. How could\nsuch a change be made without Rosamond’s concurrence? The immediate\noccasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her was forced upon him.Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security\ncould possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate had offered\nthe one good security in his power to the less peremptory creditor, who\nwas a silversmith and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself\nthe upholsterer’s credit also, accepting interest for a given term. The\nsecurity necessary was a bill of sale on the furniture of his house,\nwhich might make a creditor easy for a reasonable time about a debt\namounting to less than four hundred pounds; and the silversmith, Mr.\nDover, was willing to reduce it by taking back a portion of the plate\nand any other article which was as good as new. “Any other article” was\na phrase delicately implying jewellery, and more particularly some\npurple amethysts costing thirty pounds, which Lydgate had bought as a\nbridal present.Opinions may be divided as to his wisdom in making this present: some\nmay think that it was a graceful attention to be expected from a man\nlike Lydgate, and that the fault of any troublesome consequences lay in\nthe pinched narrowness of provincial life at that time, which offered\nno conveniences for professional people whose fortune was not\nproportioned to their tastes; also, in Lydgate’s ridiculous\nfastidiousness about asking his friends for money."

  "content": "However, it had seemed a question of no moment to him on that fine\nmorning when he went to give a final order for plate: in the presence\nof other jewels enormously expensive, and as an addition to orders of\nwhich the amount had not been exactly calculated, thirty pounds for\nornaments so exquisitely suited to Rosamond’s neck and arms could\nhardly appear excessive when there was no ready cash for it to exceed.\nBut at this crisis Lydgate’s imagination could not help dwelling on the\npossibility of letting the amethysts take their place again among Mr.\nDover’s stock, though he shrank from the idea of proposing this to\nRosamond. Having been roused to discern consequences which he had never\nbeen in the habit of tracing, he was preparing to act on this\ndiscernment with some of the rigor (by no means all) that he would have\napplied in pursuing experiment. He was nerving himself to this rigor as\nhe rode from Brassing, and meditated on the representations he must\nmake to Rosamond.It was evening when he got home. He was intensely miserable, this\nstrong man of nine-and-twenty and of many gifts. He was not saying\nangrily within himself that he had made a profound mistake; but the\nmistake was at work in him like a recognized chronic disease, mingling\nits uneasy importunities with every prospect, and enfeebling every\nthought. As he went along the passage to the drawing-room, he heard the\npiano and singing. Of course, Ladislaw was there. It was some weeks\nsince Will had parted from Dorothea, yet he was still at the old post\nin Middlemarch. Lydgate had no objection in general to Ladislaw’s\ncoming, but just now he was annoyed that he could not find his hearth\nfree. When he opened the door the two singers went on towards the\nkey-note, raising their eyes and looking at him indeed, but not\nregarding his entrance as an interruption. To a man galled with his\nharness as poor Lydgate was, it is not soothing to see two people\nwarbling at him, as he comes in with the sense that the painful day has\nstill pains in store. His face, already paler than usual, took on a\nscowl as he walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.The singers feeling themselves excused by the fact that they had only\nthree bars to sing, now turned round.“How are you, Lydgate?” said Will, coming forward to shake hands.Lydgate took his hand, but did not think it necessary to speak.“Have you dined, Tertius? I expected you much earlier,” said Rosamond,\nwho had already seen that her husband was in a “horrible humor.” She\nseated herself in her usual place as she spoke.“I have dined. I should like some tea, please,” said Lydgate, curtly,\nstill scowling and looking markedly at his legs stretched out before\nhim.Will was too quick to need more. “I shall be off,” he said, reaching\nhis hat.“Tea is coming,” said Rosamond; “pray don’t go.”"

Good-by;” and he went quickly out of the room."

  "content": "Rosamond did not look at her husband, but presently rose and took her\nplace before the tea-tray. She was thinking that she had never seen him\nso disagreeable. Lydgate turned his dark eyes on her and watched her as\nshe delicately handled the tea-service with her taper fingers, and\nlooked at the objects immediately before her with no curve in her face\ndisturbed, and yet with an ineffable protest in her air against all\npeople with unpleasant manners. For the moment he lost the sense of his\nwound in a sudden speculation about this new form of feminine\nimpassibility revealing itself in the sylph-like frame which he had\nonce interpreted as the sign of a ready intelligent sensitiveness. His\nmind glancing back to Laure while he looked at Rosamond, he said\ninwardly, “Would _she_ kill me because I wearied her?” and then, “It is\nthe way with all women.” But this power of generalizing which gives men\nso much the superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was\nimmediately thwarted by Lydgate’s memory of wondering impressions from\nthe behavior of another woman—from Dorothea’s looks and tones of\nemotion about her husband when Lydgate began to attend him—from her\npassionate cry to be taught what would best comfort that man for whose\nsake it seemed as if she must quell every impulse in her except the\nyearnings of faithfulness and compassion. These revived impressions\nsucceeded each other quickly and dreamily in Lydgate’s mind while the\ntea was being brewed. He had shut his eyes in the last instant of\nreverie while he heard Dorothea saying, “Advise me—think what I can\ndo—he has been all his life laboring and looking forward. He minds\nabout nothing else—and I mind about nothing else.”That voice of deep-souled womanhood had remained within him as the\nenkindling conceptions of dead and sceptred genius had remained within\nhim (is there not a genius for feeling nobly which also reigns over\nhuman spirits and their conclusions?); the tones were a music from\nwhich he was falling away—he had really fallen into a momentary doze,\nwhen Rosamond said in her silvery neutral way, “Here is your tea,\nTertius,” setting it on the small table by his side, and then moved\nback to her place without looking at him. Lydgate was too hasty in\nattributing insensibility to her; after her own fashion, she was\nsensitive enough, and took lasting impressions. Her impression now was\none of offence and repulsion. But then, Rosamond had no scowls and had\nnever raised her voice: she was quite sure that no one could justly\nfind fault with her.Perhaps Lydgate and she had never felt so far off each other before;\nbut there were strong reasons for not deferring his revelation, even if\nhe had not already begun it by that abrupt announcement; indeed some of\nthe angry desire to rouse her into more sensibility on his account\nwhich had prompted him to speak prematurely, still mingled with his\npain in the prospect of her pain. But he waited till the tray was gone,\nthe candles were lit, and the evening quiet might be counted on: the\ninterval had left time for repelled tenderness to return into the old\ncourse. He spoke kindly.“Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,” he said, gently,\npushing away the table, and stretching out his arm to draw a chair near\nhis own."

  "content": "Rosamond obeyed. As she came towards him in her drapery of transparent\nfaintly tinted muslin, her slim yet round figure never looked more\ngraceful; as she sat down by him and laid one hand on the elbow of his\nchair, at last looking at him and meeting his eyes, her delicate neck\nand cheek and purely cut lips never had more of that untarnished beauty\nwhich touches as in spring-time and infancy and all sweet freshness. It\ntouched Lydgate now, and mingled the early moments of his love for her\nwith all the other memories which were stirred in this crisis of deep\ntrouble. He laid his ample hand softly on hers, saying—“Dear!” with the lingering utterance which affection gives to the word.\nRosamond too was still under the power of that same past, and her\nhusband was still in part the Lydgate whose approval had stirred\ndelight. She put his hair lightly away from his forehead, then laid her\nother hand on his, and was conscious of forgiving him.“I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you, Rosy. But there are\nthings which husband and wife must think of together. I dare say it has\noccurred to you already that I am short of money.”Lydgate paused; but Rosamond turned her neck and looked at a vase on\nthe mantel-piece.“I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were\nmarried, and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged\nto meet. The consequence is, there is a large debt at Brassing—three\nhundred and eighty pounds—which has been pressing on me a good while,\nand in fact we are getting deeper every day, for people don’t pay me\nthe faster because others want the money. I took pains to keep it from\nyou while you were not well; but now we must think together about it,\nand you must help me.”“What can _I_ do, Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning her eyes on him\nagain. That little speech of four words, like so many others in all\nlanguages, is capable by varied vocal inflections of expressing all\nstates of mind from helpless dimness to exhaustive argumentative\nperception, from the completest self-devoting fellowship to the most\nneutral aloofness. Rosamond’s thin utterance threw into the words “What\ncan—I—do!” as much neutrality as they could hold. They fell like a\nmortal chill on Lydgate’s roused tenderness. He did not storm in\nindignation—he felt too sad a sinking of the heart. And when he spoke\nagain it was more in the tone of a man who forces himself to fulfil a\ntask.“It is necessary for you to know, because I have to give security for a\ntime, and a man must come to make an inventory of the furniture.”"

The\ninventory will be begun to-morrow. Remember it is a mere security: it\nwill make no difference: it is a temporary affair. I insist upon it\nthat your father shall not know, unless I choose to tell him,” added\nLydgate, with a more peremptory emphasis.This certainly was unkind, but Rosamond had thrown him back on evil\nexpectation as to what she would do in the way of quiet steady\ndisobedience. The unkindness seemed unpardonable to her: she was not\ngiven to weeping and disliked it, but now her chin and lips began to\ntremble and the tears welled up. Perhaps it was not possible for\nLydgate, under the double stress of outward material difficulty and of\nhis own proud resistance to humiliating consequences, to imagine fully\nwhat this sudden trial was to a young creature who had known nothing\nbut indulgence, and whose dreams had all been of new indulgence, more\nexactly to her taste. But he did wish to spare her as much as he could,\nand her tears cut him to the heart.

It is I who have been\nin fault: I ought to have seen that I could not afford to live in this\nway. But many things have told against me in my practice, and it really\njust now has ebbed to a low point. I may recover it, but in the mean\ntime we must pull up—we must change our way of living.

And surely these\nodious tradesmen might be made to understand that, and to wait, if you\nwould make proper representations to them.”“This is idle Rosamond,” said Lydgate, angrily. “You must learn to take\nmy judgment on questions you don’t understand. I have made necessary\narrangements, and they must be carried out. As to friends, I have no\nexpectations whatever from them, and shall not ask them for anything.”Rosamond sat perfectly still. The thought in her mind was that if she\nhad known how Lydgate would behave, she would never have married him.“We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words, dear,” said\nLydgate, trying to be gentle again. “There are some details that I want\nto consider with you. Dover says he will take a good deal of the plate\nback again, and any of the jewellery we like. He really behaves very\nwell.”“Are we to go without spoons and forks then?” said Rosamond, whose very\nlips seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her utterance. She was\ndetermined to make no further resistance or suggestions."

  "content": "“Oh no, dear!” said Lydgate. “But look here,” he continued, drawing a\npaper from his pocket and opening it; “here is Dover’s account. See, I\nhave marked a number of articles, which if we returned them would\nreduce the amount by thirty pounds and more. I have not marked any of\nthe jewellery.” Lydgate had really felt this point of the jewellery\nvery bitter to himself; but he had overcome the feeling by severe\nargument. He could not propose to Rosamond that she should return any\nparticular present of his, but he had told himself that he was bound to\nput Dover’s offer before her, and her inward prompting might make the\naffair easy.“It is useless for me to look, Tertius,” said Rosamond, calmly; “you\nwill return what you please.” She would not turn her eyes on the paper,\nand Lydgate, flushing up to the roots of his hair, drew it back and let\nit fall on his knee. Meanwhile Rosamond quietly went out of the room,\nleaving Lydgate helpless and wondering. Was she not coming back? It\nseemed that she had no more identified herself with him than if they\nhad been creatures of different species and opposing interests. He\ntossed his head and thrust his hands deep into his pockets with a sort\nof vengeance. There was still science—there were still good objects to\nwork for. He must give a tug still—all the stronger because other\nsatisfactions were going.But the door opened and Rosamond re-entered. She carried the leather\nbox containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket which\ncontained other boxes, and laying them on the chair where she had been\nsitting, she said, with perfect propriety in her air—“This is all the jewellery you ever gave me. You can return what you\nlike of it, and of the plate also. You will not, of course, expect me\nto stay at home to-morrow. I shall go to papa’s.”To many women the look Lydgate cast at her would have been more\nterrible than one of anger: it had in it a despairing acceptance of the\ndistance she was placing between them.“And when shall you come back again?” he said, with a bitter edge on\nhis accent.“Oh, in the evening. Of course I shall not mention the subject to\nmamma.” Rosamond was convinced that no woman could behave more\nirreproachably than she was behaving; and she went to sit down at her\nwork-table. Lydgate sat meditating a minute or two, and the result was\nthat he said, with some of the old emotion in his tone—“Now we have been united, Rosy, you should not leave me to myself in\nthe first trouble that has come.”“Certainly not,” said Rosamond; “I shall do everything it becomes me to\ndo.”"

I understand your shrinking from the\nhumiliation of these money affairs. But, my dear Rosamond, as a\nquestion of pride, which I feel just as much as you can, it is surely\nbetter to manage the thing ourselves, and let the servants see as\nlittle of it as possible; and since you are my wife, there is no\nhindering your share in my disgraces—if there were disgraces.”Rosamond did not answer immediately, but at last she said, “Very well,\nI will stay at home.”“I shall not touch these jewels, Rosy. Take them away again. But I will\nwrite out a list of plate that we may return, and that can be packed up\nand sent at once.”“The servants will know _that_,” said Rosamond, with the slightest\ntouch of sarcasm.“Well, we must meet some disagreeables as necessities. Where is the\nink, I wonder?” said Lydgate, rising, and throwing the account on the\nlarger table where he meant to write.Rosamond went to reach the inkstand, and after setting it on the table\nwas going to turn away, when Lydgate, who was standing close by, put\nhis arm round her and drew her towards him, saying—“Come, darling, let us make the best of things. It will only be for a\ntime, I hope, that we shall have to be stingy and particular. Kiss me.”His native warm-heartedness took a great deal of quenching, and it is a\npart of manliness for a husband to feel keenly the fact that an\ninexperienced girl has got into trouble by marrying him. She received\nhis kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an appearance of\naccord was recovered for the time. But Lydgate could not help looking\nforward with dread to the inevitable future discussions about\nexpenditure and the necessity for a complete change in their way of\nliving.CHAPTER LIX.“They said of old the Soul had human shape,\nBut smaller, subtler than the fleshly self,\nSo wandered forth for airing when it pleased.\nAnd see! beside her cherub-face there floats\nA pale-lipped form aerial whispering\nIts promptings in that little shell her ear.”"

  "content": "News is often dispersed as thoughtlessly and effectively as that pollen\nwhich the bees carry off (having no idea how powdery they are) when\nthey are buzzing in search of their particular nectar. This fine\ncomparison has reference to Fred Vincy, who on that evening at Lowick\nParsonage heard a lively discussion among the ladies on the news which\ntheir old servant had got from Tantripp concerning Mr. Casaubon’s\nstrange mention of Mr. Ladislaw in a codicil to his will made not long\nbefore his death. Miss Winifred was astounded to find that her brother\nhad known the fact before, and observed that Camden was the most\nwonderful man for knowing things and not telling them; whereupon Mary\nGarth said that the codicil had perhaps got mixed up with the habits of\nspiders, which Miss Winifred never would listen to. Mrs. Farebrother\nconsidered that the news had something to do with their having only\nonce seen Mr. Ladislaw at Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small\ncompassionate mewings.Fred knew little and cared less about Ladislaw and the Casaubons, and\nhis mind never recurred to that discussion till one day calling on\nRosamond at his mother’s request to deliver a message as he passed, he\nhappened to see Ladislaw going away. Fred and Rosamond had little to\nsay to each other now that marriage had removed her from collision with\nthe unpleasantness of brothers, and especially now that he had taken\nwhat she held the stupid and even reprehensible step of giving up the\nChurch to take to such a business as Mr. Garth’s. Hence Fred talked by\npreference of what he considered indifferent news, and “a propos of\nthat young Ladislaw” mentioned what he had heard at Lowick Parsonage.Now Lydgate, like Mr. Farebrother, knew a great deal more than he told,\nand when he had once been set thinking about the relation between Will\nand Dorothea his conjectures had gone beyond the fact. He imagined that\nthere was a passionate attachment on both sides, and this struck him as\nmuch too serious to gossip about. He remembered Will’s irritability\nwhen he had mentioned Mrs. Casaubon, and was the more circumspect. On\nthe whole his surmises, in addition to what he knew of the fact,\nincreased his friendliness and tolerance towards Ladislaw, and made him\nunderstand the vacillation which kept him at Middlemarch after he had\nsaid that he should go away. It was significant of the separateness\nbetween Lydgate’s mind and Rosamond’s that he had no impulse to speak\nto her on the subject; indeed, he did not quite trust her reticence\ntowards Will. And he was right there; though he had no vision of the\nway in which her mind would act in urging her to speak.When she repeated Fred’s news to Lydgate, he said, “Take care you don’t\ndrop the faintest hint to Ladislaw, Rosy. He is likely to fly out as if\nyou insulted him. Of course it is a painful affair.”"

But the next time Will came when Lydgate was away,\nshe spoke archly about his not going to London as he had threatened.“I know all about it. I have a confidential little bird,” said she,\nshowing very pretty airs of her head over the bit of work held high\nbetween her active fingers. “There is a powerful magnet in this\nneighborhood.”“To be sure there is. Nobody knows that better than you,” said Will,\nwith light gallantry, but inwardly prepared to be angry.“It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous, and\nforeseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would so much\nlike to marry, and no one who would so much like to marry her as a\ncertain gentleman; and then laying a plan to spoil all by making her\nforfeit her property if she did marry that gentleman—and then—and\nthen—and then—oh, I have no doubt the end will be thoroughly romantic.”“Great God! what do you mean?” said Will, flushing over face and ears,\nhis features seeming to change as if he had had a violent shake. “Don’t\njoke; tell me what you mean.”“You don’t really know?” said Rosamond, no longer playful, and desiring\nnothing better than to tell in order that she might evoke effects.“No!” he returned, impatiently.“Don’t know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in his will that if Mrs.\nCasaubon marries you she is to forfeit all her property?”“How do you know that it is true?” said Will, eagerly.“My brother Fred heard it from the Farebrothers.” Will started up from\nhis chair and reached his hat.“I dare say she likes you better than the property,” said Rosamond,\nlooking at him from a distance.“Pray don’t say any more about it,” said Will, in a hoarse undertone\nextremely unlike his usual light voice. “It is a foul insult to her and\nto me.” Then he sat down absently, looking before him, but seeing\nnothing.“Now you are angry with _me_,” said Rosamond. “It is too bad to bear\n_me_ malice. You ought to be obliged to me for telling you.”“So I am,” said Will, abruptly, speaking with that kind of double soul\nwhich belongs to dreamers who answer questions.“I expect to hear of the marriage,” said Rosamond, playfully."

She was oppressed by ennui, and by\nthat dissatisfaction which in women’s minds is continually turning into\na trivial jealousy, referring to no real claims, springing from no\ndeeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism, and yet capable\nof impelling action as well as speech. “There really is nothing to care\nfor much,” said poor Rosamond inwardly, thinking of the family at\nQuallingham, who did not write to her; and that perhaps Tertius when he\ncame home would tease her about expenses. She had already secretly\ndisobeyed him by asking her father to help them, and he had ended\ndecisively by saying, “I am more likely to want help myself.”CHAPTER LX.Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.\n—_Justice Shallow_."

  "content": "A few days afterwards—it was already the end of August—there was an\noccasion which caused some excitement in Middlemarch: the public, if it\nchose, was to have the advantage of buying, under the distinguished\nauspices of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, the furniture, books, and pictures\nwhich anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind,\nbelonging to Edwin Larcher, Esq. This was not one of the sales\nindicating the depression of trade; on the contrary, it was due to Mr.\nLarcher’s great success in the carrying business, which warranted his\npurchase of a mansion near Riverston already furnished in high style by\nan illustrious Spa physician—furnished indeed with such large framefuls\nof expensive flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs. Larcher was\nnervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be Scriptural. Hence\nthe fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the\nhandbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the history\nof art enabled him to state that the hall furniture, to be sold without\nreserve, comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of Gibbons.At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of\nfestival. There was a table spread with the best cold eatables, as at a\nsuperior funeral; and facilities were offered for that\ngenerous-drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and\ncheerful bidding for undesirable articles. Mr. Larcher’s sale was the\nmore attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the\nend of the town, with a garden and stables attached, in that pleasant\nissue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road\nto the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode’s retired residence, known as\nthe Shrubs. In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all\nclasses with leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in\norder simply to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the\nraces. The second day, when the best furniture was to be sold,\n“everybody” was there; even Mr. Thesiger, the rector of St. Peter’s,\nhad looked in for a short time, wishing to buy the carved table, and\nhad rubbed elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock. There was a\nwreath of Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large\ntable in the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with\ndesk and hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were\noften varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the\nlarge bow-window opening on to the lawn."

  "content": "“Everybody” that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health could\nnot well endure crowds and draughts. But Mrs. Bulstrode had\nparticularly wished to have a certain picture—a “Supper at Emmaus,”\nattributed in the catalogue to Guido; and at the last moment before the\nday of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at the office of the\n“Pioneer,” of which he was now one of the proprietors, to beg of Mr.\nLadislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable\nknowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and judge of the\nvalue of this particular painting—“if,” added the scrupulously polite\nbanker, “attendance at the sale would not interfere with the\narrangements for your departure, which I know is imminent.”This proviso might have sounded rather satirically in Will’s ear if he\nhad been in a mood to care about such satire. It referred to an\nunderstanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of\nthe paper, that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over\nthe management to the subeditor whom he had been training; since he\nwished finally to quit Middlemarch. But indefinite visions of ambition\nare weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly\nagreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve\nwhen we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary. In such\nstates of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning\ntowards miracle: impossible to conceive how our wish could be\nfulfilled, still—very wonderful things have happened! Will did not\nconfess this weakness to himself, but he lingered. What was the use of\ngoing to London at that time of the year? The Rugby men who would\nremember him were not there; and so far as political writing was\nconcerned, he would rather for a few weeks go on with the “Pioneer.” At\nthe present moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to him, he\nhad both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not\nto go till he had once more seen Dorothea. Hence he replied that he had\nreasons for deferring his departure a little, and would be happy to go\nto the sale."
