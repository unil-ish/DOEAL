  "content": "Will was not without his intentions to be always generous, but our\ntongues are little triggers which have usually been pulled before\ngeneral intentions can be brought to bear. And it was too intolerable\nthat Casaubon’s dislike of him should not be fairly accounted for to\nDorothea. Yet when he had spoken he was rather uneasy as to the effect\non her.But Dorothea was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as she had\nbeen on a like occasion in Rome. And the cause lay deep. She was no\nlonger struggling against the perception of facts, but adjusting\nherself to their clearest perception; and now when she looked steadily\nat her husband’s failure, still more at his possible consciousness of\nfailure, she seemed to be looking along the one track where duty became\ntenderness. Will’s want of reticence might have been met with more\nseverity, if he had not already been recommended to her mercy by her\nhusband’s dislike, which must seem hard to her till she saw better\nreason for it.She did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly she\nsaid, with some earnestness, “Mr. Casaubon must have overcome his\ndislike of you so far as his actions were concerned: and that is\nadmirable.”“Yes; he has shown a sense of justice in family matters. It was an\nabominable thing that my grandmother should have been disinherited\nbecause she made what they called a _mesalliance_, though there was\nnothing to be said against her husband except that he was a Polish\nrefugee who gave lessons for his bread.”“I wish I knew all about her!” said Dorothea. “I wonder how she bore\nthe change from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she was happy with\nher husband! Do you know much about them?”“No; only that my grandfather was a patriot—a bright fellow—could speak\nmany languages—musical—got his bread by teaching all sorts of things.\nThey both died rather early. And I never knew much of my father, beyond\nwhat my mother told me; but he inherited the musical talents. I\nremember his slow walk and his long thin hands; and one day remains\nwith me when he was lying ill, and I was very hungry, and had only a\nlittle bit of bread.”“Ah, what a different life from mine!” said Dorothea, with keen\ninterest, clasping her hands on her lap. “I have always had too much of\neverything. But tell me how it was—Mr. Casaubon could not have known\nabout you then.”"

  "content": "“No; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, and that was\nmy last hungry day. My father died soon after, and my mother and I were\nwell taken care of. Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it as his\nduty to take care of us because of the harsh injustice which had been\nshown to his mother’s sister. But now I am telling you what is not new\nto you.”In his inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell Dorothea what\nwas rather new even in his own construction of things—namely, that Mr.\nCasaubon had never done more than pay a debt towards him. Will was much\ntoo good a fellow to be easy under the sense of being ungrateful. And\nwhen gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways of\nescaping from its bonds.“No,” answered Dorothea; “Mr. Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on\nhis own honorable actions.” She did not feel that her husband’s conduct\nwas depreciated; but this notion of what justice had required in his\nrelations with Will Ladislaw took strong hold on her mind. After a\nmoment’s pause, she added, “He had never told me that he supported your\nmother. Is she still living?”“No; she died by an accident—a fall—four years ago. It is curious that\nmy mother, too, ran away from her family, but not for the sake of her\nhusband. She never would tell me anything about her family, except that\nshe forsook them to get her own living—went on the stage, in fact. She\nwas a dark-eyed creature, with crisp ringlets, and never seemed to be\ngetting old. You see I come of rebellious blood on both sides,” Will\nended, smiling brightly at Dorothea, while she was still looking with\nserious intentness before her, like a child seeing a drama for the\nfirst time."

  "content": "But her face, too, broke into a smile as she said, “That is your\napology, I suppose, for having yourself been rather rebellious; I mean,\nto Mr. Casaubon’s wishes. You must remember that you have not done what\nhe thought best for you. And if he dislikes you—you were speaking of\ndislike a little while ago—but I should rather say, if he has shown any\npainful feelings towards you, you must consider how sensitive he has\nbecome from the wearing effect of study. Perhaps,” she continued,\ngetting into a pleading tone, “my uncle has not told you how serious\nMr. Casaubon’s illness was. It would be very petty of us who are well\nand can bear things, to think much of small offences from those who\ncarry a weight of trial.”“You teach me better,” said Will. “I will never grumble on that subject\nagain.” There was a gentleness in his tone which came from the\nunutterable contentment of perceiving—what Dorothea was hardly\nconscious of—that she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity\nand loyalty towards her husband. Will was ready to adore her pity and\nloyalty, if she would associate himself with her in manifesting them.\n“I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,” he went on, “but I\nwill never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would\ndisapprove.”“That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open smile. “I\nshall have a little kingdom then, where I shall give laws. But you will\nsoon go away, out of my rule, I imagine. You will soon be tired of\nstaying at the Grange.”“That is a point I wanted to mention to you—one of the reasons why I\nwished to speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in\nthis neighborhood. He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and\nhe wishes me to conduct that, and also to help him in other ways.”“Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?” said\nDorothea.“Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects, and\nnot settling to anything. And here is something offered to me. If you\nwould not like me to accept it, I will give it up. Otherwise I would\nrather stay in this part of the country than go away. I belong to\nnobody anywhere else.”“I should like you to stay very much,” said Dorothea, at once, as\nsimply and readily as she had spoken at Rome. There was not the shadow\nof a reason in her mind at the moment why she should not say so.“Then I _will_ stay,” said Ladislaw, shaking his head backward, rising\nand going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased."

  "content": "But the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was getting\ncontinually stronger, began to reflect that her husband felt\ndifferently from herself, and she colored deeply under the double\nembarrassment of having expressed what might be in opposition to her\nhusband’s feeling, and of having to suggest this opposition to Will.\nHis face was not turned towards her, and this made it easier to say—“But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject. I think you\nshould be guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of anything\nelse than my own feeling, which has nothing to do with the real\nquestion. But it now occurs to me—perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that\nthe proposal was not wise. Can you not wait now and mention it to him?”“I can’t wait to-day,” said Will, inwardly seared by the possibility\nthat Mr. Casaubon would enter. “The rain is quite over now. I told Mr.\nBrooke not to call for me: I would rather walk the five miles. I shall\nstrike across Halsell Common, and see the gleams on the wet grass. I\nlike that.”He approached her to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but not\ndaring to say, “Don’t mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.” No, he\ndared not, could not say it. To ask her to be less simple and direct\nwould be like breathing on the crystal that you want to see the light\nthrough. And there was always the other great dread—of himself becoming\ndimmed and forever ray-shorn in her eyes.“I wish you could have stayed,” said Dorothea, with a touch of\nmournfulness, as she rose and put out her hand. She also had her\nthought which she did not like to express:—Will certainly ought to lose\nno time in consulting Mr. Casaubon’s wishes, but for her to urge this\nmight seem an undue dictation."

  "content": "So they only said “Good-by,” and Will quitted the house, striking\nacross the fields so as not to run any risk of encountering Mr.\nCasaubon’s carriage, which, however, did not appear at the gate until\nfour o’clock. That was an unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too\nearly to gain the moral support under ennui of dressing his person for\ndinner, and too late to undress his mind of the day’s frivolous\nceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good plunge into the\nserious business of study. On such occasions he usually threw into an\neasy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London\npapers to him, closing his eyes the while. To-day, however, he declined\nthat relief, observing that he had already had too many public details\nurged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea\nasked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which\nnever forsook him even when he spoke without his waistcoat and cravat—“I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance, Dr.\nSpanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy\nrecipient of praise. He spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on\nthe Egyptian Mysteries,—using, in fact, terms which it would not become\nme to repeat.” In uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned over\nthe elbow of his chair, and swayed his head up and down, apparently as\na muscular outlet instead of that recapitulation which would not have\nbeen becoming.“I am very glad you have had that pleasure,” said Dorothea, delighted\nto see her husband less weary than usual at this hour. “Before you came\nI had been regretting that you happened to be out to-day.”“Why so, my dear?” said Mr. Casaubon, throwing himself backward again.“Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he has mentioned a proposal of\nmy uncle’s which I should like to know your opinion of.” Her husband\nshe felt was really concerned in this question. Even with her ignorance\nof the world she had a vague impression that the position offered to\nWill was out of keeping with his family connections, and certainly Mr.\nCasaubon had a claim to be consulted. He did not speak, but merely\nbowed.“Dear uncle, you know, has many projects. It appears that he has bought\none of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he has asked Mr. Ladislaw to\nstay in this neighborhood and conduct the paper for him, besides\nhelping him in other ways.”Dorothea looked at her husband while she spoke, but he had at first\nblinked and finally closed his eyes, as if to save them; while his lips\nbecame more tense. “What is your opinion?” she added, rather timidly,\nafter a slight pause.“Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion?” said Mr.\nCasaubon, opening his eyes narrowly with a knife-edged look at\nDorothea. She was really uncomfortable on the point he inquired about,\nbut she only became a little more serious, and her eyes did not swerve."

But when he mentioned the proposal, he of course expected\nme to tell you of it.”Mr. Casaubon was silent.“I feared that you might feel some objection. But certainly a young man\nwith so much talent might be very useful to my uncle—might help him to\ndo good in a better way. And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some fixed\noccupation. He has been blamed, he says, for not seeking something of\nthat kind, and he would like to stay in this neighborhood because no\none cares for him elsewhere.”Dorothea felt that this was a consideration to soften her husband.\nHowever, he did not speak, and she presently recurred to Dr. Spanning\nand the Archdeacon’s breakfast. But there was no longer sunshine on\nthese subjects.The next morning, without Dorothea’s knowledge, Mr. Casaubon despatched\nthe following letter, beginning “Dear Mr. Ladislaw” (he had always\nbefore addressed him as “Will”):—"

  "content": "“Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has been made to you, and\n(according to an inference by no means stretched) has on your part been\nin some degree entertained, which involves your residence in this\nneighborhood in a capacity which I am justified in saying touches my\nown position in such a way as renders it not only natural and\nwarrantable in me when that effect is viewed under the influence of\nlegitimate feeling, but incumbent on me when the same effect is\nconsidered in the light of my responsibilities, to state at once that\nyour acceptance of the proposal above indicated would be highly\noffensive to me. That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto here,\nwould not, I believe, be denied by any reasonable person cognizant of\nthe relations between us: relations which, though thrown into the past\nby your recent procedure, are not thereby annulled in their character\nof determining antecedents. I will not here make reflections on any\nperson’s judgment. It is enough for me to point out to yourself that\nthere are certain social fitnesses and proprieties which should hinder\na somewhat near relative of mine from becoming any wise conspicuous in\nthis vicinity in a status not only much beneath my own, but associated\nat best with the sciolism of literary or political adventurers. At any\nrate, the contrary issue must exclude you from further reception at my\nhouse.Yours faithfully,\n“EDWARD CASAUBON.”Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was innocently at work towards the further\nembitterment of her husband; dwelling, with a sympathy that grew to\nagitation, on what Will had told her about his parents and\ngrandparents. Any private hours in her day were usually spent in her\nblue-green boudoir, and she had come to be very fond of its pallid\nquaintness. Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but while the\nsummer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue\nof elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an\ninward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels,\nthe invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or our\nspiritual falls. She had been so used to struggle for and to find\nresolve in looking along the avenue towards the arch of western light\nthat the vision itself had gained a communicating power. Even the pale\nstag seemed to have reminding glances and to mean mutely, “Yes, we\nknow.” And the group of delicately touched miniatures had made an\naudience as of beings no longer disturbed about their own earthly lot,\nbut still humanly interested. Especially the mysterious “Aunt Julia”\nabout whom Dorothea had never found it easy to question her husband."

  "content": "And now, since her conversation with Will, many fresh images had\ngathered round that Aunt Julia who was Will’s grandmother; the presence\nof that delicate miniature, so like a living face that she knew,\nhelping to concentrate her feelings. What a wrong, to cut off the girl\nfrom the family protection and inheritance only because she had chosen\na man who was poor! Dorothea, early troubling her elders with questions\nabout the facts around her, had wrought herself into some independent\nclearness as to the historical, political reasons why eldest sons had\nsuperior rights, and why land should be entailed: those reasons,\nimpressing her with a certain awe, might be weightier than she knew,\nbut here was a question of ties which left them uninfringed. Here was a\ndaughter whose child—even according to the ordinary aping of\naristocratic institutions by people who are no more aristocratic than\nretired grocers, and who have no more land to “keep together” than a\nlawn and a paddock—would have a prior claim. Was inheritance a question\nof liking or of responsibility? All the energy of Dorothea’s nature\nwent on the side of responsibility—the fulfilment of claims founded on\nour own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.It was true, she said to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the\nLadislaws—that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged\nof. And now she began to think of her husband’s will, which had been\nmade at the time of their marriage, leaving the bulk of his property to\nher, with proviso in case of her having children. That ought to be\naltered; and no time ought to be lost. This very question which had\njust arisen about Will Ladislaw’s occupation, was the occasion for\nplacing things on a new, right footing. Her husband, she felt sure,\naccording to all his previous conduct, would be ready to take the just\nview, if she proposed it—she, in whose interest an unfair concentration\nof the property had been urged. His sense of right had surmounted and\nwould continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy. She\nsuspected that her uncle’s scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon, and\nthis made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh understanding\nshould be begun, so that instead of Will’s starting penniless and\naccepting the first function that offered itself, he should find\nhimself in possession of a rightful income which should be paid by her\nhusband during his life, and, by an immediate alteration of the will,\nshould be secured at his death. The vision of all this as what ought to\nbe done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of daylight, waking\nher from her previous stupidity and incurious self-absorbed ignorance\nabout her husband’s relation to others. Will Ladislaw had refused Mr.\nCasaubon’s future aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her;\nand Mr. Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon\nhim. “But he will!” said Dorothea. “The great strength of his character\nlies here. And what are we doing with our money? We make no use of half\nof our income. My own money buys me nothing but an uneasy conscience.”"

  "content": "There was a peculiar fascination for Dorothea in this division of\nproperty intended for herself, and always regarded by her as excessive.\nShe was blind, you see, to many things obvious to others—likely to\ntread in the wrong places, as Celia had warned her; yet her blindness\nto whatever did not lie in her own pure purpose carried her safely by\nthe side of precipices where vision would have been perilous with fear.The thoughts which had gathered vividness in the solitude of her\nboudoir occupied her incessantly through the day on which Mr. Casaubon\nhad sent his letter to Will. Everything seemed hindrance to her till\nshe could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband. To\nhis preoccupied mind all subjects were to be approached gently, and she\nhad never since his illness lost from her consciousness the dread of\nagitating him. But when young ardor is set brooding over the conception\nof a prompt deed, the deed itself seems to start forth with independent\nlife, mastering ideal obstacles. The day passed in a sombre fashion,\nnot unusual, though Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually silent; but\nthere were hours of the night which might be counted on as\nopportunities of conversation; for Dorothea, when aware of her\nhusband’s sleeplessness, had established a habit of rising, lighting a\ncandle, and reading him to sleep again. And this night she was from the\nbeginning sleepless, excited by resolves. He slept as usual for a few\nhours, but she had risen softly and had sat in the darkness for nearly\nan hour before he said—“Dorothea, since you are up, will you light a candle?”“Do you feel ill, dear?” was her first question, as she obeyed him.“No, not at all; but I shall be obliged, since you are up, if you will\nread me a few pages of Lowth.”“May I talk to you a little instead?” said Dorothea.“Certainly.”“I have been thinking about money all day—that I have always had too\nmuch, and especially the prospect of too much.”“These, my dear Dorothea, are providential arrangements.”“But if one has too much in consequence of others being wronged, it\nseems to me that the divine voice which tells us to set that wrong\nright must be obeyed.”“What, my love, is the bearing of your remark?”“That you have been too liberal in arrangements for me—I mean, with\nregard to property; and that makes me unhappy.”“How so? I have none but comparatively distant connections.”"

It was on that ground, I know,\nthat you educated Mr. Ladislaw and provided for his mother.”Dorothea waited a few moments for some answer that would help her\nonward. None came, and her next words seemed the more forcible to her,\nfalling clear upon the dark silence.“But surely we should regard his claim as a much greater one, even to\nthe half of that property which I know that you have destined for me.\nAnd I think he ought at once to be provided for on that understanding.\nIt is not right that he should be in the dependence of poverty while we\nare rich. And if there is any objection to the proposal he mentioned,\nthe giving him his true place and his true share would set aside any\nmotive for his accepting it.”“Mr. Ladislaw has probably been speaking to you on this subject?” said\nMr. Casaubon, with a certain biting quickness not habitual to him.“Indeed, no!” said Dorothea, earnestly. “How can you imagine it, since\nhe has so lately declined everything from you? I fear you think too\nhardly of him, dear. He only told me a little about his parents and\ngrandparents, and almost all in answer to my questions. You are so\ngood, so just—you have done everything you thought to be right. But it\nseems to me clear that more than that is right; and I must speak about\nit, since I am the person who would get what is called benefit by that\n‘more’ not being done.”There was a perceptible pause before Mr. Casaubon replied, not quickly\nas before, but with a still more biting emphasis."

Hearing him breathe quickly after he had spoken, she sat\nlistening, frightened, wretched—with a dumb inward cry for help to bear\nthis nightmare of a life in which every energy was arrested by dread.\nBut nothing else happened, except that they both remained a long while\nsleepless, without speaking again.The next day, Mr. Casaubon received the following answer from Will\nLadislaw:—"

With the fullest acknowledgment of your generous conduct to\nme in the past, I must still maintain that an obligation of this kind\ncannot fairly fetter me as you appear to expect that it should. Granted\nthat a benefactor’s wishes may constitute a claim; there must always be\na reservation as to the quality of those wishes. They may possibly\nclash with more imperative considerations. Or a benefactor’s veto might\nimpose such a negation on a man’s life that the consequent blank might\nbe more cruel than the benefaction was generous. I am merely using\nstrong illustrations. In the present case I am unable to take your view\nof the bearing which my acceptance of occupation—not enriching\ncertainly, but not dishonorable—will have on your own position which\nseems to me too substantial to be affected in that shadowy manner. And\nthough I do not believe that any change in our relations will occur\n(certainly none has yet occurred) which can nullify the obligations\nimposed on me by the past, pardon me for not seeing that those\nobligations should restrain me from using the ordinary freedom of\nliving where I choose, and maintaining myself by any lawful occupation\nI may choose. Regretting that there exists this difference between us\nas to a relation in which the conferring of benefits has been entirely\non your side—I remain, yours with persistent obligation,\nWILL LADISLAW.”Poor Mr. Casaubon felt (and must not we, being impartial, feel with him\na little?) that no man had juster cause for disgust and suspicion than\nhe. Young Ladislaw, he was sure, meant to defy and annoy him, meant to\nwin Dorothea’s confidence and sow her mind with disrespect, and perhaps\naversion, towards her husband. Some motive beneath the surface had been\nneeded to account for Will’s sudden change of course in rejecting Mr.\nCasaubon’s aid and quitting his travels; and this defiant determination\nto fix himself in the neighborhood by taking up something so much at\nvariance with his former choice as Mr. Brooke’s Middlemarch projects,\nrevealed clearly enough that the undeclared motive had relation to\nDorothea. Not for one moment did Mr. Casaubon suspect Dorothea of any\ndoubleness: he had no suspicions of her, but he had (what was little\nless uncomfortable) the positive knowledge that her tendency to form\nopinions about her husband’s conduct was accompanied with a disposition\nto regard Will Ladislaw favorably and be influenced by what he said.\nHis own proud reticence had prevented him from ever being undeceived in\nthe supposition that Dorothea had originally asked her uncle to invite\nWill to his house.And now, on receiving Will’s letter, Mr. Casaubon had to consider his\nduty. He would never have been easy to call his action anything else\nthan duty; but in this case, contending motives thrust him back into\nnegations."

Or should he consult Sir James\nChettam, and get him to concur in remonstrance against a step which\ntouched the whole family? In either case Mr. Casaubon was aware that\nfailure was just as probable as success. It was impossible for him to\nmention Dorothea’s name in the matter, and without some alarming\nurgency Mr. Brooke was as likely as not, after meeting all\nrepresentations with apparent assent, to wind up by saying, “Never\nfear, Casaubon! Depend upon it, young Ladislaw will do you credit.\nDepend upon it, I have put my finger on the right thing.” And Mr.\nCasaubon shrank nervously from communicating on the subject with Sir\nJames Chettam, between whom and himself there had never been any\ncordiality, and who would immediately think of Dorothea without any\nmention of her.Poor Mr. Casaubon was distrustful of everybody’s feeling towards him,\nespecially as a husband. To let any one suppose that he was jealous\nwould be to admit their (suspected) view of his disadvantages: to let\nthem know that he did not find marriage particularly blissful would\nimply his conversion to their (probably) earlier disapproval. It would\nbe as bad as letting Carp, and Brasenose generally, know how backward\nhe was in organizing the matter for his “Key to all Mythologies.” All\nthrough his life Mr. Casaubon had been trying not to admit even to\nhimself the inward sores of self-doubt and jealousy. And on the most\ndelicate of all personal subjects, the habit of proud suspicious\nreticence told doubly.Thus Mr. Casaubon remained proudly, bitterly silent. But he had\nforbidden Will to come to Lowick Manor, and he was mentally preparing\nother measures of frustration.CHAPTER XXXVIII.“C’est beaucoup que le jugement des hommes sur les actions humaines;\ntôt ou tard il devient efficace.”—GUIZOT.Sir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on Mr. Brooke’s\nnew courses; but it was easier to object than to hinder. Sir James\naccounted for his having come in alone one day to lunch with the\nCadwalladers by saying—“I can’t talk to you as I want, before Celia: it might hurt her.\nIndeed, it would not be right.”“I know what you mean—the ‘Pioneer’ at the Grange!” darted in Mrs.\nCadwallader, almost before the last word was off her friend’s tongue.\n“It is frightful—this taking to buying whistles and blowing them in\neverybody’s hearing. Lying in bed all day and playing at dominoes, like\npoor Lord Plessy, would be more private and bearable.”“I see they are beginning to attack our friend Brooke in the\n‘Trumpet,’” said the Rector, lounging back and smiling easily, as he\nwould have done if he had been attacked himself. “There are tremendous\nsarcasms against a landlord not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who\nreceives his own rents, and makes no returns.”"

Bulstrode, the\nbanker, is his foremost man. But he thinks Brooke would come off badly\nat a nomination.”“Exactly,” said Sir James, with earnestness. “I have been inquiring\ninto the thing, for I’ve never known anything about Middlemarch\npolitics before—the county being my business. What Brooke trusts to, is\nthat they are going to turn out Oliver because he is a Peelite. But\nHawley tells me that if they send up a Whig at all it is sure to be\nBagster, one of those candidates who come from heaven knows where, but\ndead against Ministers, and an experienced Parliamentary man. Hawley’s\nrather rough: he forgot that he was speaking to me. He said if Brooke\nwanted a pelting, he could get it cheaper than by going to the\nhustings.”“I warned you all of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her hands\noutward. “I said to Humphrey long ago, Mr. Brooke is going to make a\nsplash in the mud. And now he has done it.”“Well, he might have taken it into his head to marry,” said the Rector.\n“That would have been a graver mess than a little flirtation with\npolitics.”“He may do that afterwards,” said Mrs. Cadwallader—“when he has come\nout on the other side of the mud with an ague.”“What I care for most is his own dignity,” said Sir James. “Of course I\ncare the more because of the family. But he’s getting on in life now,\nand I don’t like to think of his exposing himself.

Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything. I thought it as\nwell to hear what he had to say; and he is against Brooke’s standing\nthis time. I think he’ll turn him round: I think the nomination may be\nstaved off.”“I know,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, nodding. “The independent member\nhasn’t got his speeches well enough by heart.”“But this Ladislaw—there again is a vexatious business,” said Sir\nJames. “We have had him two or three times to dine at the Hall (you\nhave met him, by the bye) as Brooke’s guest and a relation of\nCasaubon’s, thinking he was only on a flying visit. And now I find he’s\nin everybody’s mouth in Middlemarch as the editor of the ‘Pioneer.’\nThere are stories going about him as a quill-driving alien, a foreign\nemissary, and what not.”“Casaubon won’t like that,” said the Rector.“There _is_ some foreign blood in Ladislaw,” returned Sir James. “I\nhope he won’t go into extreme opinions and carry Brooke on.”“Oh, he’s a dangerous young sprig, that Mr. Ladislaw,” said Mrs.\nCadwallader, “with his opera songs and his ready tongue. A sort of\nByronic hero—an amorous conspirator, it strikes me. And Thomas Aquinas\nis not fond of him. I could see that, the day the picture was brought.”“I don’t like to begin on the subject with Casaubon,” said Sir James.\n“He has more right to interfere than I. But it’s a disagreeable affair\nall round. What a character for anybody with decent connections to show\nhimself in!—one of those newspaper fellows! You have only to look at\nKeck, who manages the ‘Trumpet.’ I saw him the other day with Hawley.\nHis writing is sound enough, I believe, but he’s such a low fellow,\nthat I wished he had been on the wrong side.”“What can you expect with these peddling Middlemarch papers?” said the\nRector. “I don’t suppose you could get a high style of man anywhere to\nbe writing up interests he doesn’t really care about, and for pay that\nhardly keeps him in at elbows.”“Exactly: that makes it so annoying that Brooke should have put a man\nwho has a sort of connection with the family in a position of that\nkind. For my part, I think Ladislaw is rather a fool for accepting.”"

  "content": "“It is Aquinas’s fault,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Why didn’t he use his\ninterest to get Ladislaw made an _attache_ or sent to India? That is\nhow families get rid of troublesome sprigs.”“There is no knowing to what lengths the mischief may go,” said Sir\nJames, anxiously. “But if Casaubon says nothing, what can I do?”“Oh my dear Sir James,” said the Rector, “don’t let us make too much of\nall this. It is likely enough to end in mere smoke. After a month or\ntwo Brooke and this Master Ladislaw will get tired of each other;\nLadislaw will take wing; Brooke will sell the ‘Pioneer,’ and everything\nwill settle down again as usual.”“There is one good chance—that he will not like to feel his money\noozing away,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “If I knew the items of election\nexpenses I could scare him. It’s no use plying him with wide words like\nExpenditure: I wouldn’t talk of phlebotomy, I would empty a pot of\nleeches upon him. What we good stingy people don’t like, is having our\nsixpences sucked away from us.”“And he will not like having things raked up against him,” said Sir\nJames. “There is the management of his estate. They have begun upon\nthat already. And it really is painful for me to see. It is a nuisance\nunder one’s very nose. I do think one is bound to do the best for one’s\nland and tenants, especially in these hard times.”“Perhaps the ‘Trumpet’ may rouse him to make a change, and some good\nmay come of it all,” said the Rector. “I know I should be glad. I\nshould hear less grumbling when my tithe is paid. I don’t know what I\nshould do if there were not a modus in Tipton.”“I want him to have a proper man to look after things—I want him to\ntake on Garth again,” said Sir James. “He got rid of Garth twelve years\nago, and everything has been going wrong since. I think of getting\nGarth to manage for me—he has made such a capital plan for my\nbuildings; and Lovegood is hardly up to the mark. But Garth would not\nundertake the Tipton estate again unless Brooke left it entirely to\nhim.”"

  "content": "“In the right of it too,” said the Rector. “Garth is an independent\nfellow: an original, simple-minded fellow. One day, when he was doing\nsome valuation for me, he told me point-blank that clergymen seldom\nunderstood anything about business, and did mischief when they meddled;\nbut he said it as quietly and respectfully as if he had been talking to\nme about sailors. He would make a different parish of Tipton, if Brooke\nwould let him manage. I wish, by the help of the ‘Trumpet,’ you could\nbring that round.”“If Dorothea had kept near her uncle, there would have been some\nchance,” said Sir James. “She might have got some power over him in\ntime, and she was always uneasy about the estate. She had wonderfully\ngood notions about such things. But now Casaubon takes her up entirely.\nCelia complains a good deal. We can hardly get her to dine with us,\nsince he had that fit.” Sir James ended with a look of pitying disgust,\nand Mrs. Cadwallader shrugged her shoulders as much as to say that\n_she_ was not likely to see anything new in that direction.“Poor Casaubon!” the Rector said. “That was a nasty attack. I thought\nhe looked shattered the other day at the Archdeacon’s.”“In point of fact,” resumed Sir James, not choosing to dwell on “fits,”\n“Brooke doesn’t mean badly by his tenants or any one else, but he has\ngot that way of paring and clipping at expenses.”“Come, that’s a blessing,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “That helps him to\nfind himself in a morning. He may not know his own opinions, but he\ndoes know his own pocket.”“I don’t believe a man is in pocket by stinginess on his land,” said\nSir James.“Oh, stinginess may be abused like other virtues: it will not do to\nkeep one’s own pigs lean,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had risen to look\nout of the window. “But talk of an independent politician and he will\nappear.”“What! Brooke?” said her husband.“Yes. Now, you ply him with the ‘Trumpet,’ Humphrey; and I will put the\nleeches on him. What will you do, Sir James?”“The fact is, I don’t like to begin about it with Brooke, in our mutual\nposition; the whole thing is so unpleasant. I do wish people would\nbehave like gentlemen,” said the good baronet, feeling that this was a\nsimple and comprehensive programme for social well-being."

Well, what do you think of\nthings?—going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte\nsaid—‘Since yesterday, a century has passed away:’—they’re in the next\ncentury, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on faster than\nwe are.”“Why, yes,” said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. “Here is the\n‘Trumpet’ accusing you of lagging behind—did you see?”“Eh? no,” said Mr. Brooke, dropping his gloves into his hat and hastily\nadjusting his eye-glass. But Mr. Cadwallader kept the paper in his\nhand, saying, with a smile in his eyes—“Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles from\nMiddlemarch, who receives his own rents. They say he is the most\nretrogressive man in the county. I think you must have taught them that\nword in the ‘Pioneer.’”“Oh, that is Keck—an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive, now!\nCome, that’s capital. He thinks it means destructive: they want to make\nme out a destructive, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with that\ncheerfulness which is usually sustained by an adversary’s ignorance."

Here is a sharp stroke or\ntwo. _If we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil\nsense of the word—we should say, he is one who would dub himself a\nreformer of our constitution, while every interest for which he is\nimmediately responsible is going to decay: a philanthropist who cannot\nbear one rogue to be hanged, but does not mind five honest tenants\nbeing half-starved: a man who shrieks at corruption, and keeps his\nfarms at rack-rent: who roars himself red at rotten boroughs, and does\nnot mind if every field on his farms has a rotten gate: a man very\nopen-hearted to Leeds and Manchester, no doubt; he would give any\nnumber of representatives who will pay for their seats out of their own\npockets: what he objects to giving, is a little return on rent-days to\nhelp a tenant to buy stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather\nout at a tenant’s barn-door or make his house look a little less like\nan Irish cottier’s. But we all know the wag’s definition of a\nphilanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the square of\nthe distance._ And so on. All the rest is to show what sort of\nlegislator a philanthropist is likely to make,” ended the Rector,\nthrowing down the paper, and clasping his hands at the back of his\nhead, while he looked at Mr. Brooke with an air of amused neutrality.“Come, that’s rather good, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the\npaper and trying to bear the attack as easily as his neighbor did, but\ncoloring and smiling rather nervously; “that about roaring himself red\nat rotten boroughs—I never made a speech about rotten boroughs in my\nlife. And as to roaring myself red and that kind of thing—these men\nnever understand what is good satire. Satire, you know, should be true\nup to a certain point. I recollect they said that in ‘The Edinburgh’\nsomewhere—it must be true up to a certain point.”“Well, that is really a hit about the gates,” said Sir James, anxious\nto tread carefully. “Dagley complained to me the other day that he\nhadn’t got a decent gate on his farm. Garth has invented a new pattern\nof gate—I wish you would try it. One ought to use some of one’s timber\nin that way.”“You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke,\nappearing to glance over the columns of the “Trumpet.” “That’s your\nhobby, and you don’t mind the expense.”“I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing for\nParliament,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “They said the last unsuccessful\ncandidate at Middlemarch—Giles, wasn’t his name?—spent ten thousand\npounds and failed because he did not bribe enough. What a bitter\nreflection for a man!”“Somebody was saying,” said the Rector, laughingly, “that East Retford\nwas nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery.”“Nothing of the kind,” said Mr. Brooke. “The Tories bribe, you know:\nHawley and his set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and that sort of\nthing; and they bring the voters drunk to the poll. But they are not\ngoing to have it their own way in future—not in future, you know.\nMiddlemarch is a little backward, I admit—the freemen are a little\nbackward. But we shall educate them—we shall bring them on, you know.\nThe best people there are on our side.”“Hawley says you have men on your side who will do you harm,” remarked\nSir James. “He says Bulstrode the banker will do you harm.”"

Good heavens!\nThink what it must be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And I seem to\nremember a story of a man they pretended to chair and let him fall into\na dust-heap on purpose!”“Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one’s coat,” said the\nRector. “I confess that’s what I should be afraid of, if we parsons had\nto stand at the hustings for preferment. I should be afraid of their\nreckoning up all my fishing days. Upon my word, I think the truth is\nthe hardest missile one can be pelted with.”“The fact is,” said Sir James, “if a man goes into public life he must\nbe prepared for the consequences. He must make himself proof against\ncalumny.”“My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know,” said Mr. Brooke.\n“But how will you make yourself proof against calumny? You should read\nhistory—look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of\nthing. They always happen to the best men, you know. But what is that\nin Horace?—_fiat justitia, ruat_ … something or other.”“Exactly,” said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual. “What I\nmean by being proof against calumny is being able to point to the fact\nas a contradiction.”“And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into one’s\nself,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.But it was Sir James’s evident annoyance that most stirred Mr. Brooke.\n“Well, you know, Chettam,” he said, rising, taking up his hat and\nleaning on his stick, “you and I have a different system. You are all\nfor outlay with your farms. I don’t want to make out that my system is\ngood under all circumstances—under all circumstances, you know.”“There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time,” said Sir\nJames. “Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair\nvaluation. What do you say, Cadwallader?”“I agree with you. If I were Brooke, I would choke the ‘Trumpet’ at\nonce by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving\nhim _carte blanche_ about gates and repairs: that’s my view of the\npolitical situation,” said the Rector, broadening himself by sticking\nhis thumbs in his armholes, and laughing towards Mr. Brooke."

I let the old tenants stay on.\nI’m uncommonly easy, let me tell you, uncommonly easy. I have my own\nideas, and I take my stand on them, you know. A man who does that is\nalways charged with eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of\nthing. When I change my line of action, I shall follow my own ideas.”After that, Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which he had\nomitted to send off from the Grange, and he bade everybody hurriedly\ngood-by.“I didn’t want to take a liberty with Brooke,” said Sir James; “I see\nhe is nettled. But as to what he says about old tenants, in point of\nfact no new tenant would take the farms on the present terms.”“I have a notion that he will be brought round in time,” said the\nRector. “But you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were pulling\nanother. You wanted to frighten him away from expense, and we want to\nfrighten him into it. Better let him try to be popular and see that his\ncharacter as a landlord stands in his way. I don’t think it signifies\ntwo straws about the ‘Pioneer,’ or Ladislaw, or Brooke’s speechifying\nto the Middlemarchers. But it does signify about the parishioners in\nTipton being comfortable.”“Excuse me, it is you two who are on the wrong tack,” said Mrs.\nCadwallader. “You should have proved to him that he loses money by bad\nmanagement, and then we should all have pulled together. If you put him\na-horseback on politics, I warn you of the consequences. It was all\nvery well to ride on sticks at home and call them ideas.”CHAPTER XXXIX.“If, as I have, you also doe,\n    Vertue attired in woman see,\nAnd dare love that, and say so too,\n    And forget the He and She;And if this love, though placed so,\n    From prophane men you hide,\nWhich will no faith on this bestow,\n    Or, if they doe, deride:Then you have done a braver thing\n    Than all the Worthies did,\nAnd a braver thence will spring,\n    Which is, to keep that hid.”\n—DR.

  "content": "Sir James Chettam’s mind was not fruitful in devices, but his growing\nanxiety to “act on Brooke,” once brought close to his constant belief\nin Dorothea’s capacity for influence, became formative, and issued in a\nlittle plan; namely, to plead Celia’s indisposition as a reason for\nfetching Dorothea by herself to the Hall, and to leave her at the\nGrange with the carriage on the way, after making her fully aware of\nthe situation concerning the management of the estate.In this way it happened that one day near four o’clock, when Mr. Brooke\nand Ladislaw were seated in the library, the door opened and Mrs.\nCasaubon was announced.Will, the moment before, had been low in the depths of boredom, and,\nobliged to help Mr. Brooke in arranging “documents” about hanging\nsheep-stealers, was exemplifying the power our minds have of riding\nseveral horses at once by inwardly arranging measures towards getting a\nlodging for himself in Middlemarch and cutting short his constant\nresidence at the Grange; while there flitted through all these steadier\nimages a tickling vision of a sheep-stealing epic written with Homeric\nparticularity. When Mrs. Casaubon was announced he started up as from\nan electric shock, and felt a tingling at his finger-ends. Any one\nobserving him would have seen a change in his complexion, in the\nadjustment of his facial muscles, in the vividness of his glance, which\nmight have made them imagine that every molecule in his body had passed\nthe message of a magic touch. And so it had. For effective magic is\ntranscendent nature; and who shall measure the subtlety of those\ntouches which convey the quality of soul as well as body, and make a\nman’s passion for one woman differ from his passion for another as joy\nin the morning light over valley and river and white mountain-top\ndiffers from joy among Chinese lanterns and glass panels? Will, too,\nwas made of very impressible stuff. The bow of a violin drawn near him\ncleverly, would at one stroke change the aspect of the world for him,\nand his point of view shifted as easily as his mood. Dorothea’s\nentrance was the freshness of morning.“Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now,” said Mr. Brooke, meeting and\nkissing her. “You have left Casaubon with his books, I suppose. That’s\nright. We must not have you getting too learned for a woman, you know.”"
