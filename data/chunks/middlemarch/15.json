Anyhow, it’s not a time for\nme to be drawing money out of my business, and I should wish Lydgate to\nknow that.”“I am sure he expects nothing, papa. And he has such very high\nconnections: he is sure to rise in one way or another. He is engaged in\nmaking scientific discoveries.”Mr. Vincy was silent.“I cannot give up my only prospect of happiness, papa. Mr. Lydgate is a\ngentleman. I could never love any one who was not a perfect gentleman.\nYou would not like me to go into a consumption, as Arabella Hawley did.\nAnd you know that I never change my mind.”Again papa was silent.“Promise me, papa, that you will consent to what we wish. We shall\nnever give each other up; and you know that you have always objected to\nlong courtships and late marriages.”There was a little more urgency of this kind, till Mr. Vincy said,\n“Well, well, child, he must write to me first before I can answer\nhim,”—and Rosamond was certain that she had gained her point."

  "content": "Mr. Vincy’s answer consisted chiefly in a demand that Lydgate should\ninsure his life—a demand immediately conceded. This was a delightfully\nreassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, but in the mean time not a\nself-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make everything comfortable\nabout Rosamond’s marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with\nmuch spirit. Not without prudential considerations, however. A bride\n(who is going to visit at a baronet’s) must have a few first-rate\npocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary half-dozen,\nRosamond contented herself without the very highest style of embroidery\nand Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that his sum of eight hundred\npounds had been considerably reduced since he had come to Middlemarch,\nrestrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was\nshown to him when he went into Kibble’s establishment at Brassing to\nbuy forks and spoons. He was too proud to act as if he presupposed that\nMr. Vincy would advance money to provide furniture; and though, since\nit would not be necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills\nwould be left standing over, he did not waste time in conjecturing how\nmuch his father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment\neasy. He was not going to do anything extravagant, but the requisite\nthings must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy them of a\npoor quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that\nscience and his profession were the objects he should alone pursue\nenthusiastically; but he could not imagine himself pursuing them in\nsuch a home as Wrench had—the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the\nchildren in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones,\nblack-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched\nlymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl;\nand he must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic\napparatus.Rosamond, however, was on her side much occupied with conjectures,\nthough her quick imitative perception warned her against betraying them\ntoo crudely.“I shall like so much to know your family,” she said one day, when the\nwedding journey was being discussed. “We might perhaps take a direction\nthat would allow us to see them as we returned. Which of your uncles do\nyou like best?”“Oh,—my uncle Godwin, I think. He is a good-natured old fellow.”“You were constantly at his house at Quallingham, when you were a boy,\nwere you not? I should so like to see the old spot and everything you\nwere used to. Does he know you are going to be married?”“No,” said Lydgate, carelessly, turning in his chair and rubbing his\nhair up.“Do send him word of it, you naughty undutiful nephew. He will perhaps\nask you to take me to Quallingham; and then you could show me about the\ngrounds, and I could imagine you there when you were a boy. Remember,\nyou see me in my home, just as it has been since I was a child. It is\nnot fair that I should be so ignorant of yours. But perhaps you would\nbe a little ashamed of me. I forgot that.”Lydgate smiled at her tenderly, and really accepted the suggestion that\nthe proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some\ntrouble. And now he came to think of it, he would like to see the old\nspots with Rosamond.“I will write to him, then. But my cousins are bores.”It seemed magnificent to Rosamond to be able to speak so slightingly of\na baronet’s family, and she felt much contentment in the prospect of\nbeing able to estimate them contemptuously on her own account.But mamma was near spoiling all, a day or two later, by saying—“I hope your uncle Sir Godwin will not look down on Rosy, Mr. Lydgate.\nI should think he would do something handsome. A thousand or two can be\nnothing to a baronet.”"

  "content": "“Mamma!” said Rosamond, blushing deeply; and Lydgate pitied her so much\nthat he remained silent and went to the other end of the room to\nexamine a print curiously, as if he had been absent-minded. Mamma had a\nlittle filial lecture afterwards, and was docile as usual. But Rosamond\nreflected that if any of those high-bred cousins who were bores, should\nbe induced to visit Middlemarch, they would see many things in her own\nfamily which might shock them. Hence it seemed desirable that Lydgate\nshould by-and-by get some first-rate position elsewhere than in\nMiddlemarch; and this could hardly be difficult in the case of a man\nwho had a titled uncle and could make discoveries. Lydgate, you\nperceive, had talked fervidly to Rosamond of his hopes as to the\nhighest uses of his life, and had found it delightful to be listened to\nby a creature who would bring him the sweet furtherance of satisfying\naffection—beauty—repose—such help as our thoughts get from the summer\nsky and the flower-fringed meadows.Lydgate relied much on the psychological difference between what for\nthe sake of variety I will call goose and gander: especially on the\ninnate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the\nstrength of the gander.CHAPTER XXXVII.Thrice happy she that is so well assured\nUnto herself and settled so in heart\nThat neither will for better be allured\nNe fears to worse with any chance to start,\nBut like a steddy ship doth strongly part\nThe raging waves and keeps her course aright;\nNe aught for tempest doth from it depart,\nNe aught for fairer weather’s false delight.\nSuch self-assurance need not fear the spight\nOf grudging foes; ne favour seek of friends;\nBut in the stay of her own stedfast might\nNeither to one herself nor other bends.\n    Most happy she that most assured doth rest,\n    But he most happy who such one loves best.\n—SPENSER."

  "content": "The doubt hinted by Mr. Vincy whether it were only the general election\nor the end of the world that was coming on, now that George the Fourth\nwas dead, Parliament dissolved, Wellington and Peel generally\ndepreciated and the new King apologetic, was a feeble type of the\nuncertainties in provincial opinion at that time. With the glow-worm\nlights of country places, how could men see which were their own\nthoughts in the confusion of a Tory Ministry passing Liberal measures,\nof Tory nobles and electors being anxious to return Liberals rather\nthan friends of the recreant Ministers, and of outcries for remedies\nwhich seemed to have a mysteriously remote bearing on private interest,\nand were made suspicious by the advocacy of disagreeable neighbors?\nBuyers of the Middlemarch newspapers found themselves in an anomalous\nposition: during the agitation on the Catholic Question many had given\nup the “Pioneer”—which had a motto from Charles James Fox and was in\nthe van of progress—because it had taken Peel’s side about the Papists,\nand had thus blotted its Liberalism with a toleration of Jesuitry and\nBaal; but they were ill-satisfied with the “Trumpet,” which—since its\nblasts against Rome, and in the general flaccidity of the public mind\n(nobody knowing who would support whom)—had become feeble in its\nblowing.It was a time, according to a noticeable article in the “Pioneer,” when\nthe crying needs of the country might well counteract a reluctance to\npublic action on the part of men whose minds had from long experience\nacquired breadth as well as concentration, decision of judgment as well\nas tolerance, dispassionateness as well as energy—in fact, all those\nqualities which in the melancholy experience of mankind have been the\nleast disposed to share lodgings.Mr. Hackbutt, whose fluent speech was at that time floating more widely\nthan usual, and leaving much uncertainty as to its ultimate channel,\nwas heard to say in Mr. Hawley’s office that the article in question\n“emanated” from Brooke of Tipton, and that Brooke had secretly bought\nthe “Pioneer” some months ago.“That means mischief, eh?” said Mr. Hawley. “He’s got the freak of\nbeing a popular man now, after dangling about like a stray tortoise. So\nmuch the worse for him. I’ve had my eye on him for some time. He shall\nbe prettily pumped upon. He’s a damned bad landlord. What business has\nan old county man to come currying favor with a low set of dark-blue\nfreemen? As to his paper, I only hope he may do the writing himself. It\nwould be worth our paying for.”“I understand he has got a very brilliant young fellow to edit it, who\ncan write the highest style of leading article, quite equal to anything\nin the London papers. And he means to take very high ground on Reform.”“Let Brooke reform his rent-roll. He’s a cursed old screw, and the\nbuildings all over his estate are going to rack. I suppose this young\nfellow is some loose fish from London.”“His name is Ladislaw. He is said to be of foreign extraction.”“I know the sort,” said Mr. Hawley; “some emissary. He’ll begin with\nflourishing about the Rights of Man and end with murdering a wench.\nThat’s the style.”"

  "content": "“You must concede that there are abuses, Hawley,” said Mr. Hackbutt,\nforeseeing some political disagreement with his family lawyer. “I\nmyself should never favor immoderate views—in fact I take my stand with\nHuskisson—but I cannot blind myself to the consideration that the\nnon-representation of large towns—”“Large towns be damned!” said Mr. Hawley, impatient of exposition. “I\nknow a little too much about Middlemarch elections. Let ’em quash every\npocket borough to-morrow, and bring in every mushroom town in the\nkingdom—they’ll only increase the expense of getting into Parliament. I\ngo upon facts.”Mr. Hawley’s disgust at the notion of the “Pioneer” being edited by an\nemissary, and of Brooke becoming actively political—as if a tortoise of\ndesultory pursuits should protrude its small head ambitiously and\nbecome rampant—was hardly equal to the annoyance felt by some members\nof Mr. Brooke’s own family. The result had oozed forth gradually, like\nthe discovery that your neighbor has set up an unpleasant kind of\nmanufacture which will be permanently under your nostrils without legal\nremedy. The “Pioneer” had been secretly bought even before Will\nLadislaw’s arrival, the expected opportunity having offered itself in\nthe readiness of the proprietor to part with a valuable property which\ndid not pay; and in the interval since Mr. Brooke had written his\ninvitation, those germinal ideas of making his mind tell upon the world\nat large which had been present in him from his younger years, but had\nhitherto lain in some obstruction, had been sprouting under cover.The development was much furthered by a delight in his guest which\nproved greater even than he had anticipated. For it seemed that Will\nwas not only at home in all those artistic and literary subjects which\nMr. Brooke had gone into at one time, but that he was strikingly ready\nat seizing the points of the political situation, and dealing with them\nin that large spirit which, aided by adequate memory, lends itself to\nquotation and general effectiveness of treatment."

  "content": "“He seems to me a kind of Shelley, you know,” Mr. Brooke took an\nopportunity of saying, for the gratification of Mr. Casaubon. “I don’t\nmean as to anything objectionable—laxities or atheism, or anything of\nthat kind, you know—Ladislaw’s sentiments in every way I am sure are\ngood—indeed, we were talking a great deal together last night. But he\nhas the same sort of enthusiasm for liberty, freedom, emancipation—a\nfine thing under guidance—under guidance, you know. I think I shall be\nable to put him on the right tack; and I am the more pleased because he\nis a relation of yours, Casaubon.”If the right tack implied anything more precise than the rest of Mr.\nBrooke’s speech, Mr. Casaubon silently hoped that it referred to some\noccupation at a great distance from Lowick. He had disliked Will while\nhe helped him, but he had begun to dislike him still more now that Will\nhad declined his help. That is the way with us when we have any uneasy\njealousy in our disposition: if our talents are chiefly of the\nburrowing kind, our honey-sipping cousin (whom we have grave reasons\nfor objecting to) is likely to have a secret contempt for us, and any\none who admires him passes an oblique criticism on ourselves. Having\nthe scruples of rectitude in our souls, we are above the meanness of\ninjuring him—rather we meet all his claims on us by active benefits;\nand the drawing of cheques for him, being a superiority which he must\nrecognize, gives our bitterness a milder infusion. Now Mr. Casaubon had\nbeen deprived of that superiority (as anything more than a remembrance)\nin a sudden, capricious manner. His antipathy to Will did not spring\nfrom the common jealousy of a winter-worn husband: it was something\ndeeper, bred by his lifelong claims and discontents; but Dorothea, now\nthat she was present—Dorothea, as a young wife who herself had shown an\noffensive capability of criticism, necessarily gave concentration to\nthe uneasiness which had before been vague."

  "content": "Will Ladislaw on his side felt that his dislike was flourishing at the\nexpense of his gratitude, and spent much inward discourse in justifying\nthe dislike. Casaubon hated him—he knew that very well; on his first\nentrance he could discern a bitterness in the mouth and a venom in the\nglance which would almost justify declaring war in spite of past\nbenefits. He was much obliged to Casaubon in the past, but really the\nact of marrying this wife was a set-off against the obligation. It was\na question whether gratitude which refers to what is done for one’s\nself ought not to give way to indignation at what is done against\nanother. And Casaubon had done a wrong to Dorothea in marrying her. A\nman was bound to know himself better than that, and if he chose to grow\ngray crunching bones in a cavern, he had no business to be luring a\ngirl into his companionship. “It is the most horrible of\nvirgin-sacrifices,” said Will; and he painted to himself what were\nDorothea’s inward sorrows as if he had been writing a choric wail. But\nhe would never lose sight of her: he would watch over her—if he gave up\neverything else in life he would watch over her, and she should know\nthat she had one slave in the world. Will had—to use Sir Thomas\nBrowne’s phrase—a “passionate prodigality” of statement both to himself\nand others. The simple truth was that nothing then invited him so\nstrongly as the presence of Dorothea.Invitations of the formal kind had been wanting, however, for Will had\nnever been asked to go to Lowick. Mr. Brooke, indeed, confident of\ndoing everything agreeable which Casaubon, poor fellow, was too much\nabsorbed to think of, had arranged to bring Ladislaw to Lowick several\ntimes (not neglecting meanwhile to introduce him elsewhere on every\nopportunity as “a young relative of Casaubon’s”). And though Will had\nnot seen Dorothea alone, their interviews had been enough to restore\nher former sense of young companionship with one who was cleverer than\nherself, yet seemed ready to be swayed by her. Poor Dorothea before her\nmarriage had never found much room in other minds for what she cared\nmost to say; and she had not, as we know, enjoyed her husband’s\nsuperior instruction so much as she had expected. If she spoke with any\nkeenness of interest to Mr. Casaubon, he heard her with an air of\npatience as if she had given a quotation from the Delectus familiar to\nhim from his tender years, and sometimes mentioned curtly what ancient\nsects or personages had held similar ideas, as if there were too much\nof that sort in stock already; at other times he would inform her that\nshe was mistaken, and reassert what her remark had questioned.But Will Ladislaw always seemed to see more in what she said than she\nherself saw. Dorothea had little vanity, but she had the ardent woman’s\nneed to rule beneficently by making the joy of another soul. Hence the\nmere chance of seeing Will occasionally was like a lunette opened in\nthe wall of her prison, giving her a glimpse of the sunny air; and this\npleasure began to nullify her original alarm at what her husband might\nthink about the introduction of Will as her uncle’s guest. On this\nsubject Mr. Casaubon had remained dumb."

  "content": "But Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient of slow\ncircumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse between Dante\nand Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the proportion of\nthings, and in later days it is preferable to have fewer sonnets and\nmore conversation. Necessity excused stratagem, but stratagem was\nlimited by the dread of offending Dorothea. He found out at last that\nhe wanted to take a particular sketch at Lowick; and one morning when\nMr. Brooke had to drive along the Lowick road on his way to the county\ntown, Will asked to be set down with his sketch-book and camp-stool at\nLowick, and without announcing himself at the Manor settled himself to\nsketch in a position where he must see Dorothea if she came out to\nwalk—and he knew that she usually walked an hour in the morning.But the stratagem was defeated by the weather. Clouds gathered with\ntreacherous quickness, the rain came down, and Will was obliged to take\nshelter in the house. He intended, on the strength of relationship, to\ngo into the drawing-room and wait there without being announced; and\nseeing his old acquaintance the butler in the hall, he said, “Don’t\nmention that I am here, Pratt; I will wait till luncheon; I know Mr.\nCasaubon does not like to be disturbed when he is in the library.”“Master is out, sir; there’s only Mrs. Casaubon in the library. I’d\nbetter tell her you’re here, sir,” said Pratt, a red-cheeked man given\nto lively converse with Tantripp, and often agreeing with her that it\nmust be dull for Madam.“Oh, very well; this confounded rain has hindered me from sketching,”\nsaid Will, feeling so happy that he affected indifference with\ndelightful ease.In another minute he was in the library, and Dorothea was meeting him\nwith her sweet unconstrained smile.“Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon’s,” she said, at once. “I\ndon’t know whether he will be at home again long before dinner. He was\nuncertain how long he should be. Did you want to say anything\nparticular to him?”“No; I came to sketch, but the rain drove me in. Else I would not have\ndisturbed you yet. I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here, and I know he\ndislikes interruption at this hour.”“I am indebted to the rain, then. I am so glad to see you.” Dorothea\nuttered these common words with the simple sincerity of an unhappy\nchild, visited at school.“I really came for the chance of seeing you alone,” said Will,\nmysteriously forced to be just as simple as she was. He could not stay\nto ask himself, why not? “I wanted to talk about things, as we did in\nRome. It always makes a difference when other people are present.”"

  "content": "“Yes,” said Dorothea, in her clear full tone of assent. “Sit down.” She\nseated herself on a dark ottoman with the brown books behind her,\nlooking in her plain dress of some thin woollen-white material, without\na single ornament on her besides her wedding-ring, as if she were under\na vow to be different from all other women; and Will sat down opposite\nher at two yards’ distance, the light falling on his bright curls and\ndelicate but rather petulant profile, with its defiant curves of lip\nand chin. Each looked at the other as if they had been two flowers\nwhich had opened then and there. Dorothea for the moment forgot her\nhusband’s mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at\nher thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had\nfound receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she\nexaggerated a past solace.“I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,” she\nsaid, immediately. “It seems strange to me how many things I said to\nyou.”“I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content in his\nsoul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be\nperfectly loved. I think his own feelings at that moment were perfect,\nfor we mortals have our divine moments, when love is satisfied in the\ncompleteness of the beloved object.“I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,” said\nDorothea. “I can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to understand\njust a little Greek. I can help Mr. Casaubon better now. I can find out\nreferences for him and save his eyes in many ways. But it is very\ndifficult to be learned; it seems as if people were worn out on the way\nto great thoughts, and can never enjoy them because they are too\ntired.”“If a man has a capacity for great thoughts, he is likely to overtake\nthem before he is decrepit,” said Will, with irrepressible quickness.\nBut through certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick as he, and\nseeing her face change, he added, immediately, “But it is quite true\nthat the best minds have been sometimes overstrained in working out\ntheir ideas.”“You correct me,” said Dorothea. “I expressed myself ill. I should have\nsaid that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in working\nthem out. I used to feel about that, even when I was a little girl; and\nit always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life\nwould be to help some one who did great works, so that his burthen\nmight be lighter.”"

  "content": "Dorothea was led on to this bit of autobiography without any sense of\nmaking a revelation. But she had never before said anything to Will\nwhich threw so strong a light on her marriage. He did not shrug his\nshoulders; and for want of that muscular outlet he thought the more\nirritably of beautiful lips kissing holy skulls and other emptinesses\necclesiastically enshrined. Also he had to take care that his speech\nshould not betray that thought.“But you may easily carry the help too far,” he said, “and get\nover-wrought yourself. Are you not too much shut up? You already look\npaler. It would be better for Mr. Casaubon to have a secretary; he\ncould easily get a man who would do half his work for him. It would\nsave him more effectually, and you need only help him in lighter ways.”“How can you think of that?” said Dorothea, in a tone of earnest\nremonstrance. “I should have no happiness if I did not help him in his\nwork. What could I do? There is no good to be done in Lowick. The only\nthing I desire is to help him more. And he objects to a secretary:\nplease not to mention that again.”“Certainly not, now I know your feeling. But I have heard both Mr.\nBrooke and Sir James Chettam express the same wish.”“Yes,” said Dorothea, “but they don’t understand—they want me to be a\ngreat deal on horseback, and have the garden altered and new\nconservatories, to fill up my days. I thought you could understand that\none’s mind has other wants,” she added, rather impatiently—“besides,\nMr. Casaubon cannot bear to hear of a secretary.”“My mistake is excusable,” said Will. “In old days I used to hear Mr.\nCasaubon speak as if he looked forward to having a secretary. Indeed he\nheld out the prospect of that office to me. But I turned out to be—not\ngood enough for it.”Dorothea was trying to extract out of this an excuse for her husband’s\nevident repulsion, as she said, with a playful smile, “You were not a\nsteady worker enough.”“No,” said Will, shaking his head backward somewhat after the manner of\na spirited horse. And then, the old irritable demon prompting him to\ngive another good pinch at the moth-wings of poor Mr. Casaubon’s glory,\nhe went on, “And I have seen since that Mr. Casaubon does not like any\none to overlook his work and know thoroughly what he is doing. He is\ntoo doubtful—too uncertain of himself. I may not be good for much, but\nhe dislikes me because I disagree with him.”"

And it was too intolerable\nthat Casaubon’s dislike of him should not be fairly accounted for to\nDorothea. Yet when he had spoken he was rather uneasy as to the effect\non her.But Dorothea was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as she had\nbeen on a like occasion in Rome. And the cause lay deep. She was no\nlonger struggling against the perception of facts, but adjusting\nherself to their clearest perception; and now when she looked steadily\nat her husband’s failure, still more at his possible consciousness of\nfailure, she seemed to be looking along the one track where duty became\ntenderness. Will’s want of reticence might have been met with more\nseverity, if he had not already been recommended to her mercy by her\nhusband’s dislike, which must seem hard to her till she saw better\nreason for it.She did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly she\nsaid, with some earnestness, “Mr. Casaubon must have overcome his\ndislike of you so far as his actions were concerned: and that is\nadmirable.”“Yes; he has shown a sense of justice in family matters. It was an\nabominable thing that my grandmother should have been disinherited\nbecause she made what they called a _mesalliance_, though there was\nnothing to be said against her husband except that he was a Polish\nrefugee who gave lessons for his bread.”“I wish I knew all about her!” said Dorothea. “I wonder how she bore\nthe change from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she was happy with\nher husband! Do you know much about them?”“No; only that my grandfather was a patriot—a bright fellow—could speak\nmany languages—musical—got his bread by teaching all sorts of things.\nThey both died rather early. And I never knew much of my father, beyond\nwhat my mother told me; but he inherited the musical talents. I\nremember his slow walk and his long thin hands; and one day remains\nwith me when he was lying ill, and I was very hungry, and had only a\nlittle bit of bread.”“Ah, what a different life from mine!” said Dorothea, with keen\ninterest, clasping her hands on her lap. “I have always had too much of\neverything.

Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it as his\nduty to take care of us because of the harsh injustice which had been\nshown to his mother’s sister. But now I am telling you what is not new\nto you.”In his inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell Dorothea what\nwas rather new even in his own construction of things—namely, that Mr.\nCasaubon had never done more than pay a debt towards him. Will was much\ntoo good a fellow to be easy under the sense of being ungrateful. And\nwhen gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways of\nescaping from its bonds.“No,” answered Dorothea; “Mr. Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on\nhis own honorable actions.” She did not feel that her husband’s conduct\nwas depreciated; but this notion of what justice had required in his\nrelations with Will Ladislaw took strong hold on her mind. After a\nmoment’s pause, she added, “He had never told me that he supported your\nmother. Is she still living?”“No; she died by an accident—a fall—four years ago. It is curious that\nmy mother, too, ran away from her family, but not for the sake of her\nhusband. She never would tell me anything about her family, except that\nshe forsook them to get her own living—went on the stage, in fact. She\nwas a dark-eyed creature, with crisp ringlets, and never seemed to be\ngetting old. You see I come of rebellious blood on both sides,” Will\nended, smiling brightly at Dorothea, while she was still looking with\nserious intentness before her, like a child seeing a drama for the\nfirst time."

You must remember that you have not done what\nhe thought best for you. And if he dislikes you—you were speaking of\ndislike a little while ago—but I should rather say, if he has shown any\npainful feelings towards you, you must consider how sensitive he has\nbecome from the wearing effect of study. Perhaps,” she continued,\ngetting into a pleading tone, “my uncle has not told you how serious\nMr. Casaubon’s illness was. It would be very petty of us who are well\nand can bear things, to think much of small offences from those who\ncarry a weight of trial.”“You teach me better,” said Will. “I will never grumble on that subject\nagain.” There was a gentleness in his tone which came from the\nunutterable contentment of perceiving—what Dorothea was hardly\nconscious of—that she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity\nand loyalty towards her husband. Will was ready to adore her pity and\nloyalty, if she would associate himself with her in manifesting them.\n“I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,” he went on, “but I\nwill never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would\ndisapprove.”“That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open smile. “I\nshall have a little kingdom then, where I shall give laws. But you will\nsoon go away, out of my rule, I imagine. You will soon be tired of\nstaying at the Grange.”“That is a point I wanted to mention to you—one of the reasons why I\nwished to speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in\nthis neighborhood. He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and\nhe wishes me to conduct that, and also to help him in other ways.”“Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?” said\nDorothea.“Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects, and\nnot settling to anything. And here is something offered to me. If you\nwould not like me to accept it, I will give it up. Otherwise I would\nrather stay in this part of the country than go away. I belong to\nnobody anywhere else.”“I should like you to stay very much,” said Dorothea, at once, as\nsimply and readily as she had spoken at Rome. There was not the shadow\nof a reason in her mind at the moment why she should not say so.“Then I _will_ stay,” said Ladislaw, shaking his head backward, rising\nand going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased."

  "content": "But the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was getting\ncontinually stronger, began to reflect that her husband felt\ndifferently from herself, and she colored deeply under the double\nembarrassment of having expressed what might be in opposition to her\nhusband’s feeling, and of having to suggest this opposition to Will.\nHis face was not turned towards her, and this made it easier to say—“But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject. I think you\nshould be guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of anything\nelse than my own feeling, which has nothing to do with the real\nquestion. But it now occurs to me—perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that\nthe proposal was not wise. Can you not wait now and mention it to him?”“I can’t wait to-day,” said Will, inwardly seared by the possibility\nthat Mr. Casaubon would enter. “The rain is quite over now. I told Mr.\nBrooke not to call for me: I would rather walk the five miles. I shall\nstrike across Halsell Common, and see the gleams on the wet grass. I\nlike that.”He approached her to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but not\ndaring to say, “Don’t mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.” No, he\ndared not, could not say it. To ask her to be less simple and direct\nwould be like breathing on the crystal that you want to see the light\nthrough. And there was always the other great dread—of himself becoming\ndimmed and forever ray-shorn in her eyes.“I wish you could have stayed,” said Dorothea, with a touch of\nmournfulness, as she rose and put out her hand. She also had her\nthought which she did not like to express:—Will certainly ought to lose\nno time in consulting Mr. Casaubon’s wishes, but for her to urge this\nmight seem an undue dictation."

That was an unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too\nearly to gain the moral support under ennui of dressing his person for\ndinner, and too late to undress his mind of the day’s frivolous\nceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good plunge into the\nserious business of study. On such occasions he usually threw into an\neasy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London\npapers to him, closing his eyes the while. To-day, however, he declined\nthat relief, observing that he had already had too many public details\nurged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea\nasked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which\nnever forsook him even when he spoke without his waistcoat and cravat—“I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance, Dr.\nSpanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy\nrecipient of praise. He spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on\nthe Egyptian Mysteries,—using, in fact, terms which it would not become\nme to repeat.” In uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned over\nthe elbow of his chair, and swayed his head up and down, apparently as\na muscular outlet instead of that recapitulation which would not have\nbeen becoming.“I am very glad you have had that pleasure,” said Dorothea, delighted\nto see her husband less weary than usual at this hour. “Before you came\nI had been regretting that you happened to be out to-day.”“Why so, my dear?” said Mr. Casaubon, throwing himself backward again.“Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he has mentioned a proposal of\nmy uncle’s which I should like to know your opinion of.” Her husband\nshe felt was really concerned in this question. Even with her ignorance\nof the world she had a vague impression that the position offered to\nWill was out of keeping with his family connections, and certainly Mr.\nCasaubon had a claim to be consulted. He did not speak, but merely\nbowed.“Dear uncle, you know, has many projects. It appears that he has bought\none of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he has asked Mr. Ladislaw to\nstay in this neighborhood and conduct the paper for him, besides\nhelping him in other ways.”Dorothea looked at her husband while she spoke, but he had at first\nblinked and finally closed his eyes, as if to save them; while his lips\nbecame more tense. “What is your opinion?” she added, rather timidly,\nafter a slight pause.“Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion?” said Mr.\nCasaubon, opening his eyes narrowly with a knife-edged look at\nDorothea. She was really uncomfortable on the point he inquired about,\nbut she only became a little more serious, and her eyes did not swerve."

But when he mentioned the proposal, he of course expected\nme to tell you of it.”Mr. Casaubon was silent.“I feared that you might feel some objection. But certainly a young man\nwith so much talent might be very useful to my uncle—might help him to\ndo good in a better way. And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some fixed\noccupation. He has been blamed, he says, for not seeking something of\nthat kind, and he would like to stay in this neighborhood because no\none cares for him elsewhere.”Dorothea felt that this was a consideration to soften her husband.\nHowever, he did not speak, and she presently recurred to Dr. Spanning\nand the Archdeacon’s breakfast. But there was no longer sunshine on\nthese subjects.The next morning, without Dorothea’s knowledge, Mr. Casaubon despatched\nthe following letter, beginning “Dear Mr. Ladislaw” (he had always\nbefore addressed him as “Will”):—"

  "content": "“Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has been made to you, and\n(according to an inference by no means stretched) has on your part been\nin some degree entertained, which involves your residence in this\nneighborhood in a capacity which I am justified in saying touches my\nown position in such a way as renders it not only natural and\nwarrantable in me when that effect is viewed under the influence of\nlegitimate feeling, but incumbent on me when the same effect is\nconsidered in the light of my responsibilities, to state at once that\nyour acceptance of the proposal above indicated would be highly\noffensive to me. That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto here,\nwould not, I believe, be denied by any reasonable person cognizant of\nthe relations between us: relations which, though thrown into the past\nby your recent procedure, are not thereby annulled in their character\nof determining antecedents. I will not here make reflections on any\nperson’s judgment. It is enough for me to point out to yourself that\nthere are certain social fitnesses and proprieties which should hinder\na somewhat near relative of mine from becoming any wise conspicuous in\nthis vicinity in a status not only much beneath my own, but associated\nat best with the sciolism of literary or political adventurers. At any\nrate, the contrary issue must exclude you from further reception at my\nhouse.Yours faithfully,\n“EDWARD CASAUBON.”Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was innocently at work towards the further\nembitterment of her husband; dwelling, with a sympathy that grew to\nagitation, on what Will had told her about his parents and\ngrandparents. Any private hours in her day were usually spent in her\nblue-green boudoir, and she had come to be very fond of its pallid\nquaintness. Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but while the\nsummer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue\nof elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an\ninward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels,\nthe invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or our\nspiritual falls. She had been so used to struggle for and to find\nresolve in looking along the avenue towards the arch of western light\nthat the vision itself had gained a communicating power. Even the pale\nstag seemed to have reminding glances and to mean mutely, “Yes, we\nknow.” And the group of delicately touched miniatures had made an\naudience as of beings no longer disturbed about their own earthly lot,\nbut still humanly interested. Especially the mysterious “Aunt Julia”\nabout whom Dorothea had never found it easy to question her husband."

  "content": "And now, since her conversation with Will, many fresh images had\ngathered round that Aunt Julia who was Will’s grandmother; the presence\nof that delicate miniature, so like a living face that she knew,\nhelping to concentrate her feelings. What a wrong, to cut off the girl\nfrom the family protection and inheritance only because she had chosen\na man who was poor! Dorothea, early troubling her elders with questions\nabout the facts around her, had wrought herself into some independent\nclearness as to the historical, political reasons why eldest sons had\nsuperior rights, and why land should be entailed: those reasons,\nimpressing her with a certain awe, might be weightier than she knew,\nbut here was a question of ties which left them uninfringed. Here was a\ndaughter whose child—even according to the ordinary aping of\naristocratic institutions by people who are no more aristocratic than\nretired grocers, and who have no more land to “keep together” than a\nlawn and a paddock—would have a prior claim. Was inheritance a question\nof liking or of responsibility? All the energy of Dorothea’s nature\nwent on the side of responsibility—the fulfilment of claims founded on\nour own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.It was true, she said to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the\nLadislaws—that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged\nof. And now she began to think of her husband’s will, which had been\nmade at the time of their marriage, leaving the bulk of his property to\nher, with proviso in case of her having children. That ought to be\naltered; and no time ought to be lost. This very question which had\njust arisen about Will Ladislaw’s occupation, was the occasion for\nplacing things on a new, right footing. Her husband, she felt sure,\naccording to all his previous conduct, would be ready to take the just\nview, if she proposed it—she, in whose interest an unfair concentration\nof the property had been urged. His sense of right had surmounted and\nwould continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy. She\nsuspected that her uncle’s scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon, and\nthis made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh understanding\nshould be begun, so that instead of Will’s starting penniless and\naccepting the first function that offered itself, he should find\nhimself in possession of a rightful income which should be paid by her\nhusband during his life, and, by an immediate alteration of the will,\nshould be secured at his death. The vision of all this as what ought to\nbe done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of daylight, waking\nher from her previous stupidity and incurious self-absorbed ignorance\nabout her husband’s relation to others. Will Ladislaw had refused Mr.\nCasaubon’s future aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her;\nand Mr. Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon\nhim. “But he will!” said Dorothea. “The great strength of his character\nlies here. And what are we doing with our money? We make no use of half\nof our income. My own money buys me nothing but an uneasy conscience.”"

Everything seemed hindrance to her till\nshe could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband. To\nhis preoccupied mind all subjects were to be approached gently, and she\nhad never since his illness lost from her consciousness the dread of\nagitating him. But when young ardor is set brooding over the conception\nof a prompt deed, the deed itself seems to start forth with independent\nlife, mastering ideal obstacles. The day passed in a sombre fashion,\nnot unusual, though Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually silent; but\nthere were hours of the night which might be counted on as\nopportunities of conversation; for Dorothea, when aware of her\nhusband’s sleeplessness, had established a habit of rising, lighting a\ncandle, and reading him to sleep again. And this night she was from the\nbeginning sleepless, excited by resolves. He slept as usual for a few\nhours, but she had risen softly and had sat in the darkness for nearly\nan hour before he said—“Dorothea, since you are up, will you light a candle?”“Do you feel ill, dear?” was her first question, as she obeyed him.“No, not at all; but I shall be obliged, since you are up, if you will\nread me a few pages of Lowth.”“May I talk to you a little instead?” said Dorothea.“Certainly.”“I have been thinking about money all day—that I have always had too\nmuch, and especially the prospect of too much.”“These, my dear Dorothea, are providential arrangements.”“But if one has too much in consequence of others being wronged, it\nseems to me that the divine voice which tells us to set that wrong\nright must be obeyed.”“What, my love, is the bearing of your remark?”“That you have been too liberal in arrangements for me—I mean, with\nregard to property; and that makes me unhappy.”“How so? I have none but comparatively distant connections.”"

It was on that ground, I know,\nthat you educated Mr. Ladislaw and provided for his mother.”Dorothea waited a few moments for some answer that would help her\nonward. None came, and her next words seemed the more forcible to her,\nfalling clear upon the dark silence.“But surely we should regard his claim as a much greater one, even to\nthe half of that property which I know that you have destined for me.\nAnd I think he ought at once to be provided for on that understanding.\nIt is not right that he should be in the dependence of poverty while we\nare rich. And if there is any objection to the proposal he mentioned,\nthe giving him his true place and his true share would set aside any\nmotive for his accepting it.”“Mr. Ladislaw has probably been speaking to you on this subject?” said\nMr. Casaubon, with a certain biting quickness not habitual to him.“Indeed, no!” said Dorothea, earnestly. “How can you imagine it, since\nhe has so lately declined everything from you? I fear you think too\nhardly of him, dear. He only told me a little about his parents and\ngrandparents, and almost all in answer to my questions. You are so\ngood, so just—you have done everything you thought to be right. But it\nseems to me clear that more than that is right; and I must speak about\nit, since I am the person who would get what is called benefit by that\n‘more’ not being done.”There was a perceptible pause before Mr. Casaubon replied, not quickly\nas before, but with a still more biting emphasis."

Suffice it, that you are not here\nqualified to discriminate.
