  "content": "“Presumed? Surely not. I should have thought it unkind if you had not\nwished to see me,” said Dorothea, her habit of speaking with perfect\ngenuineness asserting itself through all her uncertainty and agitation.\n“Are you going away immediately?”“Very soon, I think. I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a\nbarrister, since, they say, that is the preparation for all public\nbusiness. There will be a great deal of political work to be done\nby-and-by, and I mean to try and do some of it. Other men have managed\nto win an honorable position for themselves without family or money.”“And that will make it all the more honorable,” said Dorothea,\nardently. “Besides, you have so many talents. I have heard from my\nuncle how well you speak in public, so that every one is sorry when you\nleave off, and how clearly you can explain things. And you care that\njustice should be done to every one. I am so glad. When we were in\nRome, I thought you only cared for poetry and art, and the things that\nadorn life for us who are well off. But now I know you think about the\nrest of the world.”While she was speaking Dorothea had lost her personal embarrassment,\nand had become like her former self. She looked at Will with a direct\nglance, full of delighted confidence.“You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here\nagain till I have made myself of some mark in the world?” said Will,\ntrying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get\nan expression of strong feeling from Dorothea."

  "content": "She was not aware how long it was before she answered. She had turned\nher head and was looking out of the window on the rose-bushes, which\nseemed to have in them the summers of all the years when Will would be\naway. This was not judicious behavior. But Dorothea never thought of\nstudying her manners: she thought only of bowing to a sad necessity\nwhich divided her from Will. Those first words of his about his\nintentions had seemed to make everything clear to her: he knew, she\nsupposed, all about Mr. Casaubon’s final conduct in relation to him,\nand it had come to him with the same sort of shock as to herself. He\nhad never felt more than friendship for her—had never had anything in\nhis mind to justify what she felt to be her husband’s outrage on the\nfeelings of both: and that friendship he still felt. Something which\nmay be called an inward silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she\nsaid with a pure voice, just trembling in the last words as if only\nfrom its liquid flexibility—“Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very happy\nwhen I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have\npatience. It will perhaps be a long while.”Will never quite knew how it was that he saved himself from falling\ndown at her feet, when the “long while” came forth with its gentle\ntremor. He used to say that the horrible hue and surface of her crape\ndress was most likely the sufficient controlling force. He sat still,\nhowever, and only said—“I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about me.”“No,” said Dorothea, “I shall never forget you. I have never forgotten\nany one whom I once knew. My life has never been crowded, and seems not\nlikely to be so. And I have a great deal of space for memory at Lowick,\nhaven’t I?” She smiled.“Good God!” Will burst out passionately, rising, with his hat still in\nhis hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he suddenly turned\nand leaned his back against it. The blood had mounted to his face and\nneck, and he looked almost angry. It had seemed to him as if they were\nlike two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other’s presence,\nwhile their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning. But\nthere was no help for it. It should never be true of him that in this\nmeeting to which he had come with bitter resolution he had ended by a\nconfession which might be interpreted into asking for her fortune.\nMoreover, it was actually true that he was fearful of the effect which\nsuch confessions might have on Dorothea herself."

But all the while there\nwas a current of thought in her about his probable want of money, and\nthe impossibility of her helping him. If her uncle had been at home,\nsomething might have been done through him! It was this preoccupation\nwith the hardship of Will’s wanting money, while she had what ought to\nhave been his share, which led her to say, seeing that he remained\nsilent and looked away from her—“I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which hangs\nup-stairs—I mean that beautiful miniature of your grandmother. I think\nit is not right for me to keep it, if you would wish to have it. It is\nwonderfully like you.”“You are very good,” said Will, irritably. “No; I don’t mind about it.\nIt is not very consoling to have one’s own likeness. It would be more\nconsoling if others wanted to have it.”“I thought you would like to cherish her memory—I thought—” Dorothea\nbroke off an instant, her imagination suddenly warning her away from\nAunt Julia’s history—“you would surely like to have the miniature as a\nfamily memorial.”“Why should I have that, when I have nothing else! A man with only a\nportmanteau for his stowage must keep his memorials in his head.”Will spoke at random: he was merely venting his petulance; it was a\nlittle too exasperating to have his grandmother’s portrait offered him\nat that moment. But to Dorothea’s feeling his words had a peculiar\nsting. She rose and said with a touch of indignation as well as\nhauteur—“You are much the happier of us two, Mr. Ladislaw, to have nothing.”Will was startled. Whatever the words might be, the tone seemed like a\ndismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a little way\ntowards her. Their eyes met, but with a strange questioning gravity.\nSomething was keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to\nconjecture what was in the other. Will had really never thought of\nhimself as having a claim of inheritance on the property which was held\nby Dorothea, and would have required a narrative to make him understand\nher present feeling.“I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now,” he said. “But\npoverty may be as bad as leprosy, if it divides us from what we most\ncare for.”The words cut Dorothea to the heart, and made her relent. She answered\nin a tone of sad fellowship."

Two years ago I had no notion of that—I\nmean of the unexpected way in which trouble comes, and ties our hands,\nand makes us silent when we long to speak. I used to despise women a\nlittle for not shaping their lives more, and doing better things. I was\nvery fond of doing as I liked, but I have almost given it up,” she\nended, smiling playfully.“I have not given up doing as I like, but I can very seldom do it,”\nsaid Will. He was standing two yards from her with his mind full of\ncontradictory desires and resolves—desiring some unmistakable proof\nthat she loved him, and yet dreading the position into which such a\nproof might bring him. “The thing one most longs for may be surrounded\nwith conditions that would be intolerable.”At this moment Pratt entered and said, “Sir James Chettam is in the\nlibrary, madam.”“Ask Sir James to come in here,” said Dorothea, immediately. It was as\nif the same electric shock had passed through her and Will. Each of\nthem felt proudly resistant, and neither looked at the other, while\nthey awaited Sir James’s entrance.After shaking hands with Dorothea, he bowed as slightly as possible to\nLadislaw, who repaid the slightness exactly, and then going towards\nDorothea, said—“I must say good-by, Mrs. Casaubon; and probably for a long while.”"

  "content": "Dorothea put out her hand and said her good-by cordially. The sense\nthat Sir James was depreciating Will, and behaving rudely to him,\nroused her resolution and dignity: there was no touch of confusion in\nher manner. And when Will had left the room, she looked with such calm\nself-possession at Sir James, saying, “How is Celia?” that he was\nobliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed him. And what would be the\nuse of behaving otherwise? Indeed, Sir James shrank with so much\ndislike from the association even in thought of Dorothea with Ladislaw\nas her possible lover, that he would himself have wished to avoid an\noutward show of displeasure which would have recognized the\ndisagreeable possibility. If any one had asked him why he shrank in\nthat way, I am not sure that he would at first have said anything\nfuller or more precise than “_That_ Ladislaw!”—though on reflection he\nmight have urged that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil, barring Dorothea’s\nmarriage with Will, except under a penalty, was enough to cast\nunfitness over any relation at all between them. His aversion was all\nthe stronger because he felt himself unable to interfere.But Sir James was a power in a way unguessed by himself. Entering at\nthat moment, he was an incorporation of the strongest reasons through\nwhich Will’s pride became a repellent force, keeping him asunder from\nDorothea.CHAPTER LV.Hath she her faults? I would you had them too.\nThey are the fruity must of soundest wine;\nOr say, they are regenerating fire\nSuch as hath turned the dense black element\nInto a crystal pathway for the sun.If youth is the season of hope, it is often so only in the sense that\nour elders are hopeful about us; for no age is so apt as youth to think\nits emotions, partings, and resolves are the last of their kind. Each\ncrisis seems final, simply because it is new. We are told that the\noldest inhabitants in Peru do not cease to be agitated by the\nearthquakes, but they probably see beyond each shock, and reflect that\nthere are plenty more to come."

  "content": "To Dorothea, still in that time of youth when the eyes with their long\nfull lashes look out after their rain of tears unsoiled and unwearied\nas a freshly opened passion-flower, that morning’s parting with Will\nLadislaw seemed to be the close of their personal relations. He was\ngoing away into the distance of unknown years, and if ever he came back\nhe would be another man. The actual state of his mind—his proud resolve\nto give the lie beforehand to any suspicion that he would play the\nneedy adventurer seeking a rich woman—lay quite out of her imagination,\nand she had interpreted all his behavior easily enough by her\nsupposition that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil seemed to him, as it did to\nher, a gross and cruel interdict on any active friendship between them.\nTheir young delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one\nelse would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of\nthe past. For this very reason she dwelt on it without inward check.\nThat unique happiness too was dead, and in its shadowed silent chamber\nshe might vent the passionate grief which she herself wondered at. For\nthe first time she took down the miniature from the wall and kept it\nbefore her, liking to blend the woman who had been too hardly judged\nwith the grandson whom her own heart and judgment defended. Can any one\nwho has rejoiced in woman’s tenderness think it a reproach to her that\nshe took the little oval picture in her palm and made a bed for it\nthere, and leaned her cheek upon it, as if that would soothe the\ncreatures who had suffered unjust condemnation? She did not know then\nthat it was Love who had come to her briefly, as in a dream before\nawaking, with the hues of morning on his wings—that it was Love to whom\nshe was sobbing her farewell as his image was banished by the blameless\nrigor of irresistible day. She only felt that there was something\nirrevocably amiss and lost in her lot, and her thoughts about the\nfuture were the more readily shapen into resolve. Ardent souls, ready\nto construct their coming lives, are apt to commit themselves to the\nfulfilment of their own visions."

  "content": "One day that she went to Freshitt to fulfil her promise of staying all\nnight and seeing baby washed, Mrs. Cadwallader came to dine, the Rector\nbeing gone on a fishing excursion. It was a warm evening, and even in\nthe delightful drawing-room, where the fine old turf sloped from the\nopen window towards a lilied pool and well-planted mounds, the heat was\nenough to make Celia in her white muslin and light curls reflect with\npity on what Dodo must feel in her black dress and close cap. But this\nwas not until some episodes with baby were over, and had left her mind\nat leisure. She had seated herself and taken up a fan for some time\nbefore she said, in her quiet guttural—“Dear Dodo, do throw off that cap. I am sure your dress must make you\nfeel ill.”“I am so used to the cap—it has become a sort of shell,” said Dorothea,\nsmiling. “I feel rather bare and exposed when it is off.”“I must see you without it; it makes us all warm,” said Celia, throwing\ndown her fan, and going to Dorothea. It was a pretty picture to see\nthis little lady in white muslin unfastening the widow’s cap from her\nmore majestic sister, and tossing it on to a chair. Just as the coils\nand braids of dark-brown hair had been set free, Sir James entered the\nroom. He looked at the released head, and said, “Ah!” in a tone of\nsatisfaction.“It was I who did it, James,” said Celia. “Dodo need not make such a\nslavery of her mourning; she need not wear that cap any more among her\nfriends.”“My dear Celia,” said Lady Chettam, “a widow must wear her mourning at\nleast a year.”“Not if she marries again before the end of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,\nwho had some pleasure in startling her good friend the Dowager. Sir\nJames was annoyed, and leaned forward to play with Celia’s Maltese dog."

  "content": "“That is very rare, I hope,” said Lady Chettam, in a tone intended to\nguard against such events. “No friend of ours ever committed herself in\nthat way except Mrs. Beevor, and it was very painful to Lord Grinsell\nwhen she did so. Her first husband was objectionable, which made it the\ngreater wonder. And severely she was punished for it. They said Captain\nBeevor dragged her about by the hair, and held up loaded pistols at\nher.”“Oh, if she took the wrong man!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who was in a\ndecidedly wicked mood. “Marriage is always bad then, first or second.\nPriority is a poor recommendation in a husband if he has got no other.\nI would rather have a good second husband than an indifferent first.”“My dear, your clever tongue runs away with you,” said Lady Chettam. “I\nam sure you would be the last woman to marry again prematurely, if our\ndear Rector were taken away.”“Oh, I make no vows; it might be a necessary economy. It is lawful to\nmarry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of\nChristians. Of course if a woman accepts the wrong man, she must take\nthe consequences, and one who does it twice over deserves her fate. But\nif she can marry blood, beauty, and bravery—the sooner the better.”“I think the subject of our conversation is very ill-chosen,” said Sir\nJames, with a look of disgust. “Suppose we change it.”“Not on my account, Sir James,” said Dorothea, determined not to lose\nthe opportunity of freeing herself from certain oblique references to\nexcellent matches. “If you are speaking on my behalf, I can assure you\nthat no question can be more indifferent and impersonal to me than\nsecond marriage. It is no more to me than if you talked of women going\nfox-hunting: whether it is admirable in them or not, I shall not follow\nthem. Pray let Mrs. Cadwallader amuse herself on that subject as much\nas on any other.”“My dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Lady Chettam, in her stateliest way, “you\ndo not, I hope, think there was any allusion to you in my mentioning\nMrs. Beevor. It was only an instance that occurred to me. She was\nstep-daughter to Lord Grinsell: he married Mrs. Teveroy for his second\nwife. There could be no possible allusion to you.”“Oh no,” said Celia. “Nobody chose the subject; it all came out of\nDodo’s cap. Mrs. Cadwallader only said what was quite true. A woman\ncould not be married in a widow’s cap, James.”"

  "content": "“Hush, my dear!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “I will not offend again. I\nwill not even refer to Dido or Zenobia. Only what are we to talk about?\nI, for my part, object to the discussion of Human Nature, because that\nis the nature of rectors’ wives.”Later in the evening, after Mrs. Cadwallader was gone, Celia said\nprivately to Dorothea, “Really, Dodo, taking your cap off made you like\nyourself again in more ways than one. You spoke up just as you used to\ndo, when anything was said to displease you. But I could hardly make\nout whether it was James that you thought wrong, or Mrs. Cadwallader.”“Neither,” said Dorothea. “James spoke out of delicacy to me, but he\nwas mistaken in supposing that I minded what Mrs. Cadwallader said. I\nshould only mind if there were a law obliging me to take any piece of\nblood and beauty that she or anybody else recommended.”“But you know, Dodo, if you ever did marry, it would be all the better\nto have blood and beauty,” said Celia, reflecting that Mr. Casaubon had\nnot been richly endowed with those gifts, and that it would be well to\ncaution Dorothea in time.“Don’t be anxious, Kitty; I have quite other thoughts about my life. I\nshall never marry again,” said Dorothea, touching her sister’s chin,\nand looking at her with indulgent affection. Celia was nursing her\nbaby, and Dorothea had come to say good-night to her.“Really—quite?” said Celia. “Not anybody at all—if he were very\nwonderful indeed?”Dorothea shook her head slowly. “Not anybody at all. I have delightful\nplans. I should like to take a great deal of land, and drain it, and\nmake a little colony, where everybody should work, and all the work\nshould be done well. I should know every one of the people and be their\nfriend. I am going to have great consultations with Mr. Garth: he can\ntell me almost everything I want to know.”“Then you _will_ be happy, if you have a plan, Dodo?” said Celia.\n“Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he grows up, and then he\ncan help you.”"

  "content": "Sir James was informed that same night that Dorothea was really quite\nset against marrying anybody at all, and was going to take to “all\nsorts of plans,” just like what she used to have. Sir James made no\nremark. To his secret feeling there was something repulsive in a\nwoman’s second marriage, and no match would prevent him from feeling it\na sort of desecration for Dorothea. He was aware that the world would\nregard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially in relation to a\nwoman of one-and-twenty; the practice of “the world” being to treat of\na young widow’s second marriage as certain and probably near, and to\nsmile with meaning if the widow acts accordingly. But if Dorothea did\nchoose to espouse her solitude, he felt that the resolution would well\nbecome her.CHAPTER LVI.“How happy is he born and taught\nThat serveth not another’s will;\nWhose armor is his honest thought,\nAnd simple truth his only skill!\n. . . . . . .\nThis man is freed from servile bands\nOf hope to rise or fear to fall;\nLord of himself though not of lands;\nAnd having nothing yet hath all.”\n—SIR HENRY WOTTON.Dorothea’s confidence in Caleb Garth’s knowledge, which had begun on\nher hearing that he approved of her cottages, had grown fast during her\nstay at Freshitt, Sir James having induced her to take rides over the\ntwo estates in company with himself and Caleb, who quite returned her\nadmiration, and told his wife that Mrs. Casaubon had a head for\nbusiness most uncommon in a woman. It must be remembered that by\n“business” Caleb never meant money transactions, but the skilful\napplication of labor.“Most uncommon!” repeated Caleb. “She said a thing I often used to\nthink myself when I was a lad:—‘Mr. Garth, I should like to feel, if I\nlived to be old, that I had improved a great piece of land and built a\ngreat many good cottages, because the work is of a healthy kind while\nit is being done, and after it is done, men are the better for it.’\nThose were the very words: she sees into things in that way.”“But womanly, I hope,” said Mrs. Garth, half suspecting that Mrs.\nCasaubon might not hold the true principle of subordination.“Oh, you can’t think!” said Caleb, shaking his head. “You would like to\nhear her speak, Susan. She speaks in such plain words, and a voice like\nmusic. Bless me! it reminds me of bits in the ‘Messiah’—‘and\nstraightway there appeared a multitude of the heavenly host, praising\nGod and saying;’ it has a tone with it that satisfies your ear.”Caleb was very fond of music, and when he could afford it went to hear\nan oratorio that came within his reach, returning from it with a\nprofound reverence for this mighty structure of tones, which made him\nsit meditatively, looking on the floor and throwing much unutterable\nlanguage into his outstretched hands."

  "content": "With this good understanding between them, it was natural that Dorothea\nasked Mr. Garth to undertake any business connected with the three\nfarms and the numerous tenements attached to Lowick Manor; indeed, his\nexpectation of getting work for two was being fast fulfilled. As he\nsaid, “Business breeds.” And one form of business which was beginning\nto breed just then was the construction of railways. A projected line\nwas to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed\nin a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the\ninfant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of\nCaleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to\ntwo persons who were dear to him. The submarine railway may have its\ndifficulties; but the bed of the sea is not divided among various\nlanded proprietors with claims for damages not only measurable but\nsentimental. In the hundred to which Middlemarch belonged railways were\nas exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or the imminent horrors of\nCholera, and those who held the most decided views on the subject were\nwomen and landholders. Women both old and young regarded travelling by\nsteam as presumptuous and dangerous, and argued against it by saying\nthat nothing should induce them to get into a railway carriage; while\nproprietors, differing from each other in their arguments as much as\nMr. Solomon Featherstone differed from Lord Medlicote, were yet\nunanimous in the opinion that in selling land, whether to the Enemy of\nmankind or to a company obliged to purchase, these pernicious agencies\nmust be made to pay a very high price to landowners for permission to\ninjure mankind.But the slower wits, such as Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule, who both\noccupied land of their own, took a long time to arrive at this\nconclusion, their minds halting at the vivid conception of what it\nwould be to cut the Big Pasture in two, and turn it into three-cornered\nbits, which would be “nohow;” while accommodation-bridges and high\npayments were remote and incredible.“The cows will all cast their calves, brother,” said Mrs. Waule, in a\ntone of deep melancholy, “if the railway comes across the Near Close;\nand I shouldn’t wonder at the mare too, if she was in foal. It’s a poor\ntale if a widow’s property is to be spaded away, and the law say\nnothing to it. What’s to hinder ’em from cutting right and left if they\nbegin? It’s well known, _I_ can’t fight.”“The best way would be to say nothing, and set somebody on to send ’em\naway with a flea in their ear, when they came spying and measuring,”\nsaid Solomon. “Folks did that about Brassing, by what I can understand.\nIt’s all a pretence, if the truth was known, about their being forced\nto take one way. Let ’em go cutting in another parish. And I don’t\nbelieve in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of ruffians to\ntrample your crops. Where’s a company’s pocket?”“Brother Peter, God forgive him, got money out of a company,” said Mrs.\nWaule. “But that was for the manganese. That wasn’t for railways to\nblow you to pieces right and left.”“Well, there’s this to be said, Jane,” Mr. Solomon concluded, lowering\nhis voice in a cautious manner—“the more spokes we put in their wheel,\nthe more they’ll pay us to let ’em go on, if they must come whether or\nnot.”"

  "content": "This reasoning of Mr. Solomon’s was perhaps less thorough than he\nimagined, his cunning bearing about the same relation to the course of\nrailways as the cunning of a diplomatist bears to the general chill or\ncatarrh of the solar system. But he set about acting on his views in a\nthoroughly diplomatic manner, by stimulating suspicion. His side of\nLowick was the most remote from the village, and the houses of the\nlaboring people were either lone cottages or were collected in a hamlet\ncalled Frick, where a water-mill and some stone-pits made a little\ncentre of slow, heavy-shouldered industry.In the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public\nopinion in Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy\ncorner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding\nrather that it was likely to be against the poor man, and that\nsuspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it. Even the rumor\nof Reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in Frick,\nthere being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous grains to\nfatten Hiram Ford’s pig, or of a publican at the “Weights and Scales”\nwho would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the\nthree neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter. And without\ndistinct good of this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing\nwith the bragging of pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every\nknowing person. The men of Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given\nto fanaticism than to a strong muscular suspicion; less inclined to\nbelieve that they were peculiarly cared for by heaven, than to regard\nheaven itself as rather disposed to take them in—a disposition\nobservable in the weather."

  "content": "Thus the mind of Frick was exactly of the sort for Mr. Solomon\nFeatherstone to work upon, he having more plenteous ideas of the same\norder, with a suspicion of heaven and earth which was better fed and\nmore entirely at leisure. Solomon was overseer of the roads at that\ntime, and on his slow-paced cob often took his rounds by Frick to look\nat the workmen getting the stones there, pausing with a mysterious\ndeliberation, which might have misled you into supposing that he had\nsome other reason for staying than the mere want of impulse to move.\nAfter looking for a long while at any work that was going on, he would\nraise his eyes a little and look at the horizon; finally he would shake\nhis bridle, touch his horse with the whip, and get it to move slowly\nonward. The hour-hand of a clock was quick by comparison with Mr.\nSolomon, who had an agreeable sense that he could afford to be slow. He\nwas in the habit of pausing for a cautious, vaguely designing chat with\nevery hedger or ditcher on his way, and was especially willing to\nlisten even to news which he had heard before, feeling himself at an\nadvantage over all narrators in partially disbelieving them. One day,\nhowever, he got into a dialogue with Hiram Ford, a wagoner, in which he\nhimself contributed information. He wished to know whether Hiram had\nseen fellows with staves and instruments spying about: they called\nthemselves railroad people, but there was no telling what they were or\nwhat they meant to do. The least they pretended was that they were\ngoing to cut Lowick Parish into sixes and sevens.“Why, there’ll be no stirrin’ from one pla-ace to another,” said Hiram,\nthinking of his wagon and horses.“Not a bit,” said Mr. Solomon. “And cutting up fine land such as this\nparish! Let ’em go into Tipton, say I. But there’s no knowing what\nthere is at the bottom of it. Traffic is what they put for’ard; but\nit’s to do harm to the land and the poor man in the long-run.”“Why, they’re Lunnon chaps, I reckon,” said Hiram, who had a dim notion\nof London as a centre of hostility to the country.“Ay, to be sure. And in some parts against Brassing, by what I’ve heard\nsay, the folks fell on ’em when they were spying, and broke their\npeep-holes as they carry, and drove ’em away, so as they knew better\nthan come again.”“It war good foon, I’d be bound,” said Hiram, whose fun was much\nrestricted by circumstances.“Well, I wouldn’t meddle with ’em myself,” said Solomon. “But some say\nthis country’s seen its best days, and the sign is, as it’s being\noverrun with these fellows trampling right and left, and wanting to cut\nit up into railways; and all for the big traffic to swallow up the\nlittle, so as there shan’t be a team left on the land, nor a whip to\ncrack.”“I’ll crack _my_ whip about their ear’n, afore they bring it to that,\nthough,” said Hiram, while Mr. Solomon, shaking his bridle, moved\nonward.Nettle-seed needs no digging. The ruin of this countryside by railroads\nwas discussed, not only at the “Weights and Scales,” but in the\nhay-field, where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for\ntalk such as were rarely had through the rural year."

He put up his gig at Yoddrell’s, and in\nwalking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his\nwork, he encountered the party of the company’s agents, who were\nadjusting their spirit-level. After a little chat he left them,\nobserving that by-and-by they would reach him again where he was going\nto measure. It was one of those gray mornings after light rains, which\nbecome delicious about twelve o’clock, when the clouds part a little,\nand the scent of the earth is sweet along the lanes and by the\nhedgerows."

  "content": "The scent would have been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along\nthe lanes on horseback, if his mind had not been worried by\nunsuccessful efforts to imagine what he was to do, with his father on\none side expecting him straightway to enter the Church, with Mary on\nthe other threatening to forsake him if he did enter it, and with the\nworking-day world showing no eager need whatever of a young gentleman\nwithout capital and generally unskilled. It was the harder to Fred’s\ndisposition because his father, satisfied that he was no longer\nrebellious, was in good humor with him, and had sent him on this\npleasant ride to see after some greyhounds. Even when he had fixed on\nwhat he should do, there would be the task of telling his father. But\nit must be admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the\nmore difficult task:—what secular avocation on earth was there for a\nyoung man (whose friends could not get him an “appointment”) which was\nat once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special\nknowledge? Riding along the lanes by Frick in this mood, and slackening\nhis pace while he reflected whether he should venture to go round by\nLowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he could see over the hedges from one\nfield to another. Suddenly a noise roused his attention, and on the far\nside of a field on his left hand he could see six or seven men in\nsmock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive approach\ntowards the four railway agents who were facing them, while Caleb Garth\nand his assistant were hastening across the field to join the\nthreatened group. Fred, delayed a few moments by having to find the\ngate, could not gallop up to the spot before the party in smock-frocks,\nwhose work of turning the hay had not been too pressing after\nswallowing their mid-day beer, were driving the men in coats before\nthem with their hay-forks; while Caleb Garth’s assistant, a lad of\nseventeen, who had snatched up the spirit-level at Caleb’s order, had\nbeen knocked down and seemed to be lying helpless. The coated men had\nthe advantage as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting in\nfront of the smock-frocks and charging them suddenly enough to throw\ntheir chase into confusion. “What do you confounded fools mean?”\nshouted Fred, pursuing the divided group in a zigzag, and cutting right\nand left with his whip. “I’ll swear to every one of you before the\nmagistrate. You’ve knocked the lad down and killed him, for what I\nknow. You’ll every one of you be hanged at the next assizes, if you\ndon’t mind,” said Fred, who afterwards laughed heartily as he\nremembered his own phrases."

Yo git off your horse, young measter, and I’ll\nhave a round wi’ ye, I wull. Yo daredn’t come on wi’out your hoss an’\nwhip. I’d soon knock the breath out on ye, I would.”“Wait a minute, and I’ll come back presently, and have a round with you\nall in turn, if you like,” said Fred, who felt confidence in his power\nof boxing with his dearly beloved brethren. But just now he wanted to\nhasten back to Caleb and the prostrate youth.The lad’s ankle was strained, and he was in much pain from it, but he\nwas no further hurt, and Fred placed him on the horse that he might\nride to Yoddrell’s and be taken care of there.“Let them put the horse in the stable, and tell the surveyors they can\ncome back for their traps,” said Fred. “The ground is clear now.”“No, no,” said Caleb, “here’s a breakage. They’ll have to give up for\nto-day, and it will be as well. Here, take the things before you on the\nhorse, Tom. They’ll see you coming, and they’ll turn back.”“I’m glad I happened to be here at the right moment, Mr. Garth,” said\nFred, as Tom rode away. “No knowing what might have happened if the\ncavalry had not come up in time.”“Ay, ay, it was lucky,” said Caleb, speaking rather absently, and\nlooking towards the spot where he had been at work at the moment of\ninterruption. “But—deuce take it—this is what comes of men being\nfools—I’m hindered of my day’s work. I can’t get along without somebody\nto help me with the measuring-chain. However!” He was beginning to move\ntowards the spot with a look of vexation, as if he had forgotten Fred’s\npresence, but suddenly he turned round and said quickly, “What have you\ngot to do to-day, young fellow?”"

I’ll help you with pleasure—can I?” said Fred,\nwith a sense that he should be courting Mary when he was helping her\nfather.“Well, you mustn’t mind stooping and getting hot.”“I don’t mind anything. Only I want to go first and have a round with\nthat hulky fellow who turned to challenge me. It would be a good lesson\nfor him. I shall not be five minutes.”“Nonsense!” said Caleb, with his most peremptory intonation. “I shall\ngo and speak to the men myself. It’s all ignorance. Somebody has been\ntelling them lies. The poor fools don’t know any better.”“I shall go with you, then,” said Fred.“No, no; stay where you are. I don’t want your young blood. I can take\ncare of myself.”Caleb was a powerful man and knew little of any fear except the fear of\nhurting others and the fear of having to speechify. But he felt it his\nduty at this moment to try and give a little harangue. There was a\nstriking mixture in him—which came from his having always been a\nhard-working man himself—of rigorous notions about workmen and\npractical indulgence towards them. To do a good day’s work and to do it\nwell, he held to be part of their welfare, as it was the chief part of\nhis own happiness; but he had a strong sense of fellowship with them.\nWhen he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work again,\nbut were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists in each\nturning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or three\nyards. They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly with one\nhand in his pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of his\nwaistcoat, and had his every-day mild air when he paused among them.“Why, my lads, how’s this?” he began, taking as usual to brief phrases,\nwhich seemed pregnant to himself, because he had many thoughts lying\nunder them, like the abundant roots of a plant that just manages to\npeep above the water. “How came you to make such a mistake as this?\nSomebody has been telling you lies. You thought those men up there\nwanted to do mischief.”“Aw!” was the answer, dropped at intervals by each according to his\ndegree of unreadiness."

The owner has nothing to say against it, and\nif you meddle with them you’ll have to do with the constable and\nJustice Blakesley, and with the handcuffs and Middlemarch jail. And you\nmight be in for it now, if anybody informed against you.”Caleb paused here, and perhaps the greatest orator could not have\nchosen either his pause or his images better for the occasion.“But come, you didn’t mean any harm. Somebody told you the railroad was\na bad thing. That was a lie. It may do a bit of harm here and there, to\nthis and to that; and so does the sun in heaven. But the railway’s a\ngood thing.”“Aw! good for the big folks to make money out on,” said old Timothy\nCooper, who had stayed behind turning his hay while the others had been\ngone on their spree;—“I’n seen lots o’ things turn up sin’ I war a\nyoung un—the war an’ the peace, and the canells, an’ the oald King\nGeorge, an’ the Regen’, an’ the new King George, an’ the new un as has\ngot a new ne-ame—an’ it’s been all aloike to the poor mon.

Caleb was in\na difficulty known to any person attempting in dark times and\nunassisted by miracle to reason with rustics who are in possession of\nan undeniable truth which they know through a hard process of feeling,\nand can let it fall like a giant’s club on your neatly carved argument\nfor a social benefit which they do not feel. Caleb had no cant at\ncommand, even if he could have chosen to use it; and he had been\naccustomed to meet all such difficulties in no other way than by doing\nhis “business” faithfully. He answered—“If you don’t think well of me, Tim, never mind; that’s neither here\nnor there now. Things may be bad for the poor man—bad they are; but I\nwant the lads here not to do what will make things worse for\nthemselves. The cattle may have a heavy load, but it won’t help ’em to\nthrow it over into the roadside pit, when it’s partly their own\nfodder.”“We war on’y for a bit o’ foon,” said Hiram, who was beginning to see\nconsequences. “That war all we war arter.”“Well, promise me not to meddle again, and I’ll see that nobody informs\nagainst you.”“I’n ne’er meddled, an’ I’n no call to promise,” said Timothy.“No, but the rest. Come, I’m as hard at work as any of you to-day, and\nI can’t spare much time. Say you’ll be quiet without the constable.”“Aw, we wooant meddle—they may do as they loike for oos”—were the forms\nin which Caleb got his pledges; and then he hastened back to Fred, who\nhad followed him, and watched him in the gateway.They went to work, and Fred helped vigorously. His spirits had risen,\nand he heartily enjoyed a good slip in the moist earth under the\nhedgerow, which soiled his perfect summer trousers. Was it his\nsuccessful onset which had elated him, or the satisfaction of helping\nMary’s father? Something more. The accidents of the morning had helped\nhis frustrated imagination to shape an employment for himself which had\nseveral attractions. I am not sure that certain fibres in Mr. Garth’s\nmind had not resumed their old vibration towards the very end which now\nrevealed itself to Fred. For the effective accident is but the touch of\nfire where there is oil and tow; and it always appeared to Fred that\nthe railway brought the needed touch. But they went on in silence\nexcept when their business demanded speech. At last, when they had\nfinished and were walking away, Mr. Garth said—“A young fellow needn’t be a B. A. to do this sort of work, eh, Fred?”"

He paused a moment, and then added, more hesitatingly, “Do you\nthink I am too old to learn your business, Mr. Garth?”“My business is of many sorts, my boy,” said Mr. Garth, smiling. “A\ngood deal of what I know can only come from experience: you can’t learn\nit off as you learn things out of a book. But you are young enough to\nlay a foundation yet.” Caleb pronounced the last sentence emphatically,\nbut paused in some uncertainty. He had been under the impression lately\nthat Fred had made up his mind to enter the Church.“You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?” said Fred,\nmore eagerly.“That depends,” said Caleb, turning his head on one side and lowering\nhis voice, with the air of a man who felt himself to be saying\nsomething deeply religious. “You must be sure of two things: you must\nlove your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting\nyour play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your\nwork, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something\nelse. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it\nwell, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s that—if I had\nthis or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man\nis—I wouldn’t give twopence for him”—here Caleb’s mouth looked bitter,\nand he snapped his fingers—“whether he was the prime minister or the\nrick-thatcher, if he didn’t do well what he undertook to do.”“I can never feel that I should do that in being a clergyman,” said\nFred, meaning to take a step in argument.“Then let it alone, my boy,” said Caleb, abruptly, “else you’ll never\nbe easy. Or, if you _are_ easy, you’ll be a poor stick.”“That is very nearly what Mary thinks about it,” said Fred, coloring.\n“I think you must know what I feel for Mary, Mr. Garth: I hope it does\nnot displease you that I have always loved her better than any one\nelse, and that I shall never love any one as I love her.”The expression of Caleb’s face was visibly softening while Fred spoke.\nBut he swung his head with a solemn slowness, and said—"

She says she will never have me if I go into the Church; and\nI shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope of\nMary. Really, if I could get some other profession, business—anything\nthat I am at all fit for, I would work hard, I would deserve your good\nopinion. I should like to have to do with outdoor things. I know a good\ndeal about land and cattle already. I used to believe, you know—though\nyou will think me rather foolish for it—that I should have land of my\nown. I am sure knowledge of that sort would come easily to me,\nespecially if I could be under you in any way.”“Softly, my boy,” said Caleb, having the image of “Susan” before his\neyes. “What have you said to your father about all this?”“Nothing, yet; but I must tell him. I am only waiting to know what I\ncan do instead of entering the Church. I am very sorry to disappoint\nhim, but a man ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he is\nfour-and-twenty. How could I know when I was fifteen, what it would be\nright for me to do now? My education was a mistake.”“But hearken to this, Fred,” said Caleb. “Are you sure Mary is fond of\nyou, or would ever have you?”“I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden me—I\ndidn’t know what else to do,” said Fred, apologetically. “And he says\nthat I have every reason to hope, if I can put myself in an honorable\nposition—I mean, out of the Church. I dare say you think it\nunwarrantable in me, Mr. Garth, to be troubling you and obtruding my\nown wishes about Mary, before I have done anything at all for myself.\nOf course I have not the least claim—indeed, I have already a debt to\nyou which will never be discharged, even when I have been able to pay\nit in the shape of money.”"

Come to me to-morrow at the\noffice, at nine o’clock. At the office, mind.”Mr. Garth would take no important step without consulting Susan, but it\nmust be confessed that before he reached home he had taken his\nresolution. With regard to a large number of matters about which other\nmen are decided or obstinate, he was the most easily manageable man in\nthe world. He never knew what meat he would choose, and if Susan had\nsaid that they ought to live in a four-roomed cottage, in order to\nsave, he would have said, “Let us go,” without inquiring into details.\nBut where Caleb’s feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he was a\nruler; and in spite of his mildness and timidity in reproving, every\none about him knew that on the exceptional occasions when he chose, he\nwas absolute. He never, indeed, chose to be absolute except on some one\nelse’s behalf. On ninety-nine points Mrs. Garth decided, but on the\nhundredth she was often aware that she would have to perform the\nsingularly difficult task of carrying out her own principle, and to\nmake herself subordinate.“It is come round as I thought, Susan,” said Caleb, when they were\nseated alone in the evening. He had already narrated the adventure\nwhich had brought about Fred’s sharing in his work, but had kept back\nthe further result. “The children _are_ fond of each other—I mean, Fred\nand Mary.”Mrs. Garth laid her work on her knee, and fixed her penetrating eyes\nanxiously on her husband.“After we’d done our work, Fred poured it all out to me. He can’t bear\nto be a clergyman, and Mary says she won’t have him if he is one; and\nthe lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business. And\nI’ve determined to take him and make a man of him.”“Caleb!” said Mrs. Garth, in a deep contralto, expressive of resigned\nastonishment."
