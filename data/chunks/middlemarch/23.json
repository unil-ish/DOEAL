  "content": "“Nothing, Mr. Garth. I’ll help you with pleasure—can I?” said Fred,\nwith a sense that he should be courting Mary when he was helping her\nfather.“Well, you mustn’t mind stooping and getting hot.”“I don’t mind anything. Only I want to go first and have a round with\nthat hulky fellow who turned to challenge me. It would be a good lesson\nfor him. I shall not be five minutes.”“Nonsense!” said Caleb, with his most peremptory intonation. “I shall\ngo and speak to the men myself. It’s all ignorance. Somebody has been\ntelling them lies. The poor fools don’t know any better.”“I shall go with you, then,” said Fred.“No, no; stay where you are. I don’t want your young blood. I can take\ncare of myself.”Caleb was a powerful man and knew little of any fear except the fear of\nhurting others and the fear of having to speechify. But he felt it his\nduty at this moment to try and give a little harangue. There was a\nstriking mixture in him—which came from his having always been a\nhard-working man himself—of rigorous notions about workmen and\npractical indulgence towards them. To do a good day’s work and to do it\nwell, he held to be part of their welfare, as it was the chief part of\nhis own happiness; but he had a strong sense of fellowship with them.\nWhen he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work again,\nbut were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists in each\nturning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or three\nyards. They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly with one\nhand in his pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of his\nwaistcoat, and had his every-day mild air when he paused among them.“Why, my lads, how’s this?” he began, taking as usual to brief phrases,\nwhich seemed pregnant to himself, because he had many thoughts lying\nunder them, like the abundant roots of a plant that just manages to\npeep above the water. “How came you to make such a mistake as this?\nSomebody has been telling you lies. You thought those men up there\nwanted to do mischief.”“Aw!” was the answer, dropped at intervals by each according to his\ndegree of unreadiness."

  "content": "“Nonsense! No such thing! They’re looking out to see which way the\nrailroad is to take. Now, my lads, you can’t hinder the railroad: it\nwill be made whether you like it or not. And if you go fighting against\nit, you’ll get yourselves into trouble. The law gives those men leave\nto come here on the land. The owner has nothing to say against it, and\nif you meddle with them you’ll have to do with the constable and\nJustice Blakesley, and with the handcuffs and Middlemarch jail. And you\nmight be in for it now, if anybody informed against you.”Caleb paused here, and perhaps the greatest orator could not have\nchosen either his pause or his images better for the occasion.“But come, you didn’t mean any harm. Somebody told you the railroad was\na bad thing. That was a lie. It may do a bit of harm here and there, to\nthis and to that; and so does the sun in heaven. But the railway’s a\ngood thing.”“Aw! good for the big folks to make money out on,” said old Timothy\nCooper, who had stayed behind turning his hay while the others had been\ngone on their spree;—“I’n seen lots o’ things turn up sin’ I war a\nyoung un—the war an’ the peace, and the canells, an’ the oald King\nGeorge, an’ the Regen’, an’ the new King George, an’ the new un as has\ngot a new ne-ame—an’ it’s been all aloike to the poor mon. What’s the\ncanells been t’ him? They’n brought him neyther me-at nor be-acon, nor\nwage to lay by, if he didn’t save it wi’ clemmin’ his own inside. Times\nha’ got wusser for him sin’ I war a young un. An’ so it’ll be wi’ the\nrailroads. They’ll on’y leave the poor mon furder behind. But them are\nfools as meddle, and so I told the chaps here. This is the big folks’s\nworld, this is. But yo’re for the big folks, Muster Garth, yo are.”"

  "content": "Timothy was a wiry old laborer, of a type lingering in those times—who\nhad his savings in a stocking-foot, lived in a lone cottage, and was\nnot to be wrought on by any oratory, having as little of the feudal\nspirit, and believing as little, as if he had not been totally\nunacquainted with the Age of Reason and the Rights of Man. Caleb was in\na difficulty known to any person attempting in dark times and\nunassisted by miracle to reason with rustics who are in possession of\nan undeniable truth which they know through a hard process of feeling,\nand can let it fall like a giant’s club on your neatly carved argument\nfor a social benefit which they do not feel. Caleb had no cant at\ncommand, even if he could have chosen to use it; and he had been\naccustomed to meet all such difficulties in no other way than by doing\nhis “business” faithfully. He answered—“If you don’t think well of me, Tim, never mind; that’s neither here\nnor there now. Things may be bad for the poor man—bad they are; but I\nwant the lads here not to do what will make things worse for\nthemselves. The cattle may have a heavy load, but it won’t help ’em to\nthrow it over into the roadside pit, when it’s partly their own\nfodder.”“We war on’y for a bit o’ foon,” said Hiram, who was beginning to see\nconsequences. “That war all we war arter.”“Well, promise me not to meddle again, and I’ll see that nobody informs\nagainst you.”“I’n ne’er meddled, an’ I’n no call to promise,” said Timothy.“No, but the rest. Come, I’m as hard at work as any of you to-day, and\nI can’t spare much time. Say you’ll be quiet without the constable.”“Aw, we wooant meddle—they may do as they loike for oos”—were the forms\nin which Caleb got his pledges; and then he hastened back to Fred, who\nhad followed him, and watched him in the gateway.They went to work, and Fred helped vigorously. His spirits had risen,\nand he heartily enjoyed a good slip in the moist earth under the\nhedgerow, which soiled his perfect summer trousers. Was it his\nsuccessful onset which had elated him, or the satisfaction of helping\nMary’s father? Something more. The accidents of the morning had helped\nhis frustrated imagination to shape an employment for himself which had\nseveral attractions. I am not sure that certain fibres in Mr. Garth’s\nmind had not resumed their old vibration towards the very end which now\nrevealed itself to Fred. For the effective accident is but the touch of\nfire where there is oil and tow; and it always appeared to Fred that\nthe railway brought the needed touch. But they went on in silence\nexcept when their business demanded speech. At last, when they had\nfinished and were walking away, Mr. Garth said—“A young fellow needn’t be a B. A. to do this sort of work, eh, Fred?”"

He paused a moment, and then added, more hesitatingly, “Do you\nthink I am too old to learn your business, Mr. Garth?”“My business is of many sorts, my boy,” said Mr. Garth, smiling. “A\ngood deal of what I know can only come from experience: you can’t learn\nit off as you learn things out of a book. But you are young enough to\nlay a foundation yet.” Caleb pronounced the last sentence emphatically,\nbut paused in some uncertainty. He had been under the impression lately\nthat Fred had made up his mind to enter the Church.“You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?” said Fred,\nmore eagerly.“That depends,” said Caleb, turning his head on one side and lowering\nhis voice, with the air of a man who felt himself to be saying\nsomething deeply religious. “You must be sure of two things: you must\nlove your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting\nyour play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your\nwork, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something\nelse. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it\nwell, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s that—if I had\nthis or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man\nis—I wouldn’t give twopence for him”—here Caleb’s mouth looked bitter,\nand he snapped his fingers—“whether he was the prime minister or the\nrick-thatcher, if he didn’t do well what he undertook to do.”“I can never feel that I should do that in being a clergyman,” said\nFred, meaning to take a step in argument.“Then let it alone, my boy,” said Caleb, abruptly, “else you’ll never\nbe easy. Or, if you _are_ easy, you’ll be a poor stick.”“That is very nearly what Mary thinks about it,” said Fred, coloring.\n“I think you must know what I feel for Mary, Mr. Garth: I hope it does\nnot displease you that I have always loved her better than any one\nelse, and that I shall never love any one as I love her.”The expression of Caleb’s face was visibly softening while Fred spoke.\nBut he swung his head with a solemn slowness, and said—"

She says she will never have me if I go into the Church; and\nI shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope of\nMary. Really, if I could get some other profession, business—anything\nthat I am at all fit for, I would work hard, I would deserve your good\nopinion. I should like to have to do with outdoor things. I know a good\ndeal about land and cattle already. I used to believe, you know—though\nyou will think me rather foolish for it—that I should have land of my\nown. I am sure knowledge of that sort would come easily to me,\nespecially if I could be under you in any way.”“Softly, my boy,” said Caleb, having the image of “Susan” before his\neyes. “What have you said to your father about all this?”“Nothing, yet; but I must tell him. I am only waiting to know what I\ncan do instead of entering the Church. I am very sorry to disappoint\nhim, but a man ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he is\nfour-and-twenty. How could I know when I was fifteen, what it would be\nright for me to do now? My education was a mistake.”“But hearken to this, Fred,” said Caleb. “Are you sure Mary is fond of\nyou, or would ever have you?”“I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden me—I\ndidn’t know what else to do,” said Fred, apologetically. “And he says\nthat I have every reason to hope, if I can put myself in an honorable\nposition—I mean, out of the Church. I dare say you think it\nunwarrantable in me, Mr. Garth, to be troubling you and obtruding my\nown wishes about Mary, before I have done anything at all for myself.\nOf course I have not the least claim—indeed, I have already a debt to\nyou which will never be discharged, even when I have been able to pay\nit in the shape of money.”"

  "content": "“Yes, my boy, you have a claim,” said Caleb, with much feeling in his\nvoice. “The young ones have always a claim on the old to help them\nforward. I was young myself once and had to do without much help; but\nhelp would have been welcome to me, if it had been only for the\nfellow-feeling’s sake. But I must consider. Come to me to-morrow at the\noffice, at nine o’clock. At the office, mind.”Mr. Garth would take no important step without consulting Susan, but it\nmust be confessed that before he reached home he had taken his\nresolution. With regard to a large number of matters about which other\nmen are decided or obstinate, he was the most easily manageable man in\nthe world. He never knew what meat he would choose, and if Susan had\nsaid that they ought to live in a four-roomed cottage, in order to\nsave, he would have said, “Let us go,” without inquiring into details.\nBut where Caleb’s feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he was a\nruler; and in spite of his mildness and timidity in reproving, every\none about him knew that on the exceptional occasions when he chose, he\nwas absolute. He never, indeed, chose to be absolute except on some one\nelse’s behalf. On ninety-nine points Mrs. Garth decided, but on the\nhundredth she was often aware that she would have to perform the\nsingularly difficult task of carrying out her own principle, and to\nmake herself subordinate.“It is come round as I thought, Susan,” said Caleb, when they were\nseated alone in the evening. He had already narrated the adventure\nwhich had brought about Fred’s sharing in his work, but had kept back\nthe further result. “The children _are_ fond of each other—I mean, Fred\nand Mary.”Mrs. Garth laid her work on her knee, and fixed her penetrating eyes\nanxiously on her husband.“After we’d done our work, Fred poured it all out to me. He can’t bear\nto be a clergyman, and Mary says she won’t have him if he is one; and\nthe lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business. And\nI’ve determined to take him and make a man of him.”“Caleb!” said Mrs. Garth, in a deep contralto, expressive of resigned\nastonishment."

The lad loves\nMary, and a true love for a good woman is a great thing, Susan. It\nshapes many a rough fellow.”“Has Mary spoken to you on the subject?” said Mrs Garth, secretly a\nlittle hurt that she had to be informed on it herself.“Not a word. I asked her about Fred once; I gave her a bit of a\nwarning. But she assured me she would never marry an idle\nself-indulgent man—nothing since. But it seems Fred set on Mr.\nFarebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden him to speak\nhimself, and Mr. Farebrother has found out that she is fond of Fred,\nbut says he must not be a clergyman. Fred’s heart is fixed on Mary,\nthat I can see: it gives me a good opinion of the lad—and we always\nliked him, Susan.”“It is a pity for Mary, I think,” said Mrs. Garth.“Why—a pity?”“Because, Caleb, she might have had a man who is worth twenty Fred\nVincy’s.”“Ah?” said Caleb, with surprise.“I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her, and meant to\nmake her an offer; but of course, now that Fred has used him as an\nenvoy, there is an end to that better prospect.” There was a severe\nprecision in Mrs. Garth’s utterance. She was vexed and disappointed,\nbut she was bent on abstaining from useless words.Caleb was silent a few moments under a conflict of feelings. He looked\nat the floor and moved his head and hands in accompaniment to some\ninward argumentation. At last he said—“That would have made me very proud and happy, Susan, and I should have\nbeen glad for your sake. I’ve always felt that your belongings have\nnever been on a level with you. But you took me, though I was a plain\nman.”“I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known,” said Mrs. Garth,\nconvinced that _she_ would never have loved any one who came short of\nthat mark."

And that is what touches me close about Fred.\nThe lad is good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he’s put in the\nright way; and he loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she\nhas given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out. I say,\nthat young man’s soul is in my hand; and I’ll do the best I can for\nhim, so help me God! It’s my duty, Susan.”Mrs. Garth was not given to tears, but there was a large one rolling\ndown her face before her husband had finished. It came from the\npressure of various feelings, in which there was much affection and\nsome vexation. She wiped it away quickly, saying—“Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in\nthat way, Caleb.”“That signifies nothing—what other men would think. I’ve got a clear\nfeeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will\ngo with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary,\npoor child.”Caleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards\nhis wife. She rose and kissed him, saying, “God bless you, Caleb! Our\nchildren have a good father.”But she went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of\nher words. She felt sure that her husband’s conduct would be\nmisunderstood, and about Fred she was rational and unhopeful. Which\nwould turn out to have the more foresight in it—her rationality or\nCaleb’s ardent generosity?When Fred went to the office the next morning, there was a test to be\ngone through which he was not prepared for.“Now Fred,” said Caleb, “you will have some desk-work. I have always\ndone a good deal of writing myself, but I can’t do without help, and as\nI want you to understand the accounts and get the values into your\nhead, I mean to do without another clerk. So you must buckle to. How\nare you at writing and arithmetic?”Fred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he had not thought of\ndesk-work; but he was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink. “I’m\nnot afraid of arithmetic, Mr. Garth: it always came easily to me. I\nthink you know my writing.”“Let us see,” said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and\nhanding it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper. “Copy me\na line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end.”"

  "content": "At that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to\nwrite legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk. Fred\nwrote the lines demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any\nviscount or bishop of the day: the vowels were all alike and the\nconsonants only distinguishable as turning up or down, the strokes had\na blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep the line—in short,\nit was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret when you\nknow beforehand what the writer means.As Caleb looked on, his visage showed a growing depression, but when\nFred handed him the paper he gave something like a snarl, and rapped\nthe paper passionately with the back of his hand. Bad work like this\ndispelled all Caleb’s mildness.“The deuce!” he exclaimed, snarlingly. “To think that this is a country\nwhere a man’s education may cost hundreds and hundreds, and it turns\nyou out this!” Then in a more pathetic tone, pushing up his spectacles\nand looking at the unfortunate scribe, “The Lord have mercy on us,\nFred, I can’t put up with this!”“What can I do, Mr. Garth?” said Fred, whose spirits had sunk very low,\nnot only at the estimate of his handwriting, but at the vision of\nhimself as liable to be ranked with office clerks.“Do? Why, you must learn to form your letters and keep the line. What’s\nthe use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?” asked Caleb,\nenergetically, quite preoccupied with the bad quality of the work. “Is\nthere so little business in the world that you must be sending puzzles\nover the country? But that’s the way people are brought up. I should\nlose no end of time with the letters some people send me, if Susan did\nnot make them out for me. It’s disgusting.” Here Caleb tossed the paper\nfrom him."

  "content": "Any stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered\nwhat was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the\nfine-looking young fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather\npatchy as he bit his lip with mortification. Fred was struggling with\nmany thoughts. Mr. Garth had been so kind and encouraging at the\nbeginning of their interview, that gratitude and hopefulness had been\nat a high pitch, and the downfall was proportionate. He had not thought\nof desk-work—in fact, like the majority of young gentlemen, he wanted\nan occupation which should be free from disagreeables. I cannot tell\nwhat might have been the consequences if he had not distinctly promised\nhimself that he would go to Lowick to see Mary and tell her that he was\nengaged to work under her father. He did not like to disappoint himself\nthere.“I am very sorry,” were all the words that he could muster. But Mr.\nGarth was already relenting.“We must make the best of it, Fred,” he began, with a return to his\nusual quiet tone. “Every man can learn to write. I taught myself. Go at\nit with a will, and sit up at night if the day-time isn’t enough. We’ll\nbe patient, my boy. Callum shall go on with the books for a bit, while\nyou are learning. But now I must be off,” said Caleb, rising. “You must\nlet your father know our agreement. You’ll save me Callum’s salary, you\nknow, when you can write; and I can afford to give you eighty pounds\nfor the first year, and more after.”When Fred made the necessary disclosure to his parents, the relative\neffect on the two was a surprise which entered very deeply into his\nmemory. He went straight from Mr. Garth’s office to the warehouse,\nrightly feeling that the most respectful way in which he could behave\nto his father was to make the painful communication as gravely and\nformally as possible. Moreover, the decision would be more certainly\nunderstood to be final, if the interview took place in his father’s\ngravest hours, which were always those spent in his private room at the\nwarehouse.Fred entered on the subject directly, and declared briefly what he had\ndone and was resolved to do, expressing at the end his regret that he\nshould be the cause of disappointment to his father, and taking the\nblame on his own deficiencies. The regret was genuine, and inspired\nFred with strong, simple words.Mr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an\nexclamation, a silence which in his impatient temperament was a sign of\nunusual emotion. He had not been in good spirits about trade that\nmorning, and the slight bitterness in his lips grew intense as he\nlistened. When Fred had ended, there was a pause of nearly a minute,\nduring which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his desk and turned the key\nemphatically. Then he looked at his son steadily, and said—"

You’ve thrown away your\neducation, and gone down a step in life, when I had given you the means\nof rising, that’s all.”“I am very sorry that we differ, father. I think I can be quite as much\nof a gentleman at the work I have undertaken, as if I had been a\ncurate. But I am grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me.”“Very well; I have no more to say. I wash my hands of you. I only hope,\nwhen you have a son of your own he will make a better return for the\npains you spend on him.”This was very cutting to Fred. His father was using that unfair\nadvantage possessed by us all when we are in a pathetic situation and\nsee our own past as if it were simply part of the pathos. In reality,\nMr. Vincy’s wishes about his son had had a great deal of pride,\ninconsiderateness, and egoistic folly in them. But still the\ndisappointed father held a strong lever; and Fred felt as if he were\nbeing banished with a malediction.“I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?” he said,\nafter rising to go; “I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my\nboard, as of course I should wish to do.”“Board be hanged!” said Mr. Vincy, recovering himself in his disgust at\nthe notion that Fred’s keep would be missed at his table. “Of course\nyour mother will want you to stay. But I shall keep no horse for you,\nyou understand; and you will pay your own tailor. You will do with a\nsuit or two less, I fancy, when you have to pay for ’em.”Fred lingered; there was still something to be said. At last it came.“I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the\nvexation I have caused you.”Mr. Vincy from his chair threw a quick glance upward at his son, who\nhad advanced near to him, and then gave his hand, saying hurriedly,\n“Yes, yes, let us say no more.”"

To her it seemed that\nthere was a Garth conspiracy to get possession of the desirable Fred,\nbut she dared not enlarge on this opinion, because a slight hint of it\nhad made him “fly out” at her as he had never done before.

It was a festival with Mrs. Garth, for her\neldest son, Christy, her peculiar joy and pride, had come home for a\nshort holiday—Christy, who held it the most desirable thing in the\nworld to be a tutor, to study all literatures and be a regenerate\nPorson, and who was an incorporate criticism on poor Fred, a sort of\nobject-lesson given to him by the educational mother. Christy himself,\na square-browed, broad-shouldered masculine edition of his mother not\nmuch higher than Fred’s shoulder—which made it the harder that he\nshould be held superior—was always as simple as possible, and thought\nno more of Fred’s disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe’s,\nwishing that he himself were more of the same height.

When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he said that he was on\nhis way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his bow, and\nsnatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode across Fred’s\noutstretched leg, and said “Take me!”“Oh, and me too,” said Letty.“You can’t keep up with Fred and me,” said Ben.“Yes, I can. Mother, please say that I am to go,” urged Letty, whose\nlife was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as a girl.“I shall stay with Christy,” observed Jim; as much as to say that he\nhad the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put her hand up\nto her head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the\nother.“Let us all go and see Mary,” said Christy, opening his arms.“No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage. And\nthat old Glasgow suit of yours would never do. Besides, your father\nwill come home. We must let Fred go alone. He can tell Mary that you\nare here, and she will come back to-morrow.”Christy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred’s\nbeautiful white trousers. Certainly Fred’s tailoring suggested the\nadvantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even of\nlooking warm and of pushing his hair back with his handkerchief.“Children, run away,” said Mrs. Garth; “it is too warm to hang about\nyour friends. Take your brother and show him the rabbits.”The eldest understood, and led off the children immediately. Fred felt\nthat Mrs. Garth wished to give him an opportunity of saying anything he\nhad to say, but he could only begin by observing—“How glad you must be to have Christy here!”“Yes; he has come sooner than I expected. He got down from the coach at\nnine o’clock, just after his father went out. I am longing for Caleb to\ncome and hear what wonderful progress Christy is making. He has paid\nhis expenses for the last year by giving lessons, carrying on hard\nstudy at the same time. He hopes soon to get a private tutorship and go\nabroad.”“He is a great fellow,” said Fred, to whom these cheerful truths had a\nmedicinal taste, “and no trouble to anybody.” After a slight pause, he\nadded, “But I fear you will think that I am going to be a great deal of\ntrouble to Mr. Garth.”"

She was knitting, and could either look at Fred or not, as she\nchose—always an advantage when one is bent on loading speech with\nsalutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth intended to be duly reserved,\nshe did wish to say something that Fred might be the better for.“I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good\nreason,” said Fred, his spirit rising a little at the perception of\nsomething like a disposition to lecture him. “I happen to have behaved\njust the worst to the people I can’t help wishing for the most from.\nBut while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother have not given me\nup, I don’t see why I should give myself up.” Fred thought it might be\nwell to suggest these masculine examples to Mrs. Garth.“Assuredly,” said she, with gathering emphasis. “A young man for whom\ntwo such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he\nthrew himself away and made their sacrifices vain.”Fred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said, “I hope\nit will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement\nto believe that I may win Mary. Mr. Garth has told you about that? You\nwere not surprised, I dare say?” Fred ended, innocently referring only\nto his own love as probably evident enough.“Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?” returned Mrs.\nGarth, who thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive to the\nfact that Mary’s friends could not possibly have wished this\nbeforehand, whatever the Vincys might suppose. “Yes, I confess I was\nsurprised.”“She never did give me any—not the least in the world, when I talked to\nher myself,” said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. “But when I asked Mr.\nFarebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a\nhope.”"

It was a little too provoking even for _her_\nself-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the\ndisappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a\nnightingale and never knowing it—and that all the while his family\nshould suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her\nvexation had fermented the more actively because of its total\nrepression towards her husband. Exemplary wives will sometimes find\nscapegoats in this way. She now said with energetic decision, “You made\na great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you.”“Did I?” said Fred, reddening instantaneously. He was alarmed, but at a\nloss to know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an apologetic tone,\n“Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of ours; and Mary, I\nknew, would listen to him gravely; and he took it on himself quite\nreadily.”“Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own\nwishes, and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,” said\nMrs. Garth. She did not mean to go beyond this salutary general\ndoctrine, and threw her indignation into a needless unwinding of her\nworsted, knitting her brow at it with a grand air.“I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,” said\nFred, who nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were beginning\nto form themselves.“Precisely; you cannot conceive,” said Mrs. Garth, cutting her words as\nneatly as possible.For a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and\nthen turning with a quick movement said almost sharply—“Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with\nMary?”“And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to\nbe surprised,” returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting down beside her\nand folding her arms. It was an unwonted sign of emotion in her that\nshe should put her work out of her hands. In fact her feelings were\ndivided between the satisfaction of giving Fred his discipline and the\nsense of having gone a little too far. Fred took his hat and stick and\nrose quickly.“Then you think I am standing in his way, and in Mary’s too?” he said,\nin a tone which seemed to demand an answer."

She had brought herself into\nthe unpleasant position of being called on to say what she really felt,\nyet what she knew there were strong reasons for concealing. And to her\nthe consciousness of having exceeded in words was peculiarly\nmortifying. Besides, Fred had given out unexpected electricity, and he\nnow added, “Mr. Garth seemed pleased that Mary should be attached to\nme. He could not have known anything of this.”Mrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her husband, the\nfear that Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily\nendurable. She answered, wanting to check unintended consequences—“I spoke from inference only. I am not aware that Mary knows anything\nof the matter.”But she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a subject\nwhich she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop\nin that way; and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of\nunintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things\nstood. Ben, bouncing across the grass with Brownie at his heels, and\nseeing the kitten dragging the knitting by a lengthening line of wool,\nshouted and clapped his hands; Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate,\njumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then jumped down again and\nswept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted\nsock-top, fitted it over the kitten’s head as a new source of madness,\nwhile Letty arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty—it\nwas a history as full of sensation as “This is the house that Jack\nbuilt.” Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came\nup and the _tête-à-tête_ with Fred was ended. He got away as soon as he\ncould, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her\nseverity by saying “God bless you” when she shook hands with him.She was unpleasantly conscious that she had been on the verge of\nspeaking as “one of the foolish women speaketh”—telling first and\nentreating silence after. But she had not entreated silence, and to\nprevent Caleb’s blame she determined to blame herself and confess all\nto him that very night. It was curious what an awful tribunal the mild\nCaleb’s was to her, whenever he set it up. But she meant to point out\nto him that the revelation might do Fred Vincy a great deal of good."

Also he was piqued that he had been\nwhat he called such a stupid lout as to ask that intervention from Mr.\nFarebrother. But it was not in a lover’s nature—it was not in Fred’s,\nthat the new anxiety raised about Mary’s feeling should not surmount\nevery other. Notwithstanding his trust in Mr. Farebrother’s generosity,\nnotwithstanding what Mary had said to him, Fred could not help feeling\nthat he had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he objected to it\nextremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary for her good,\nbeing ready rather to fight for her with any man whatsoever. But the\nfighting with Mr. Farebrother must be of a metaphorical kind, which was\nmuch more difficult to Fred than the muscular. Certainly this\nexperience was a discipline for Fred hardly less sharp than his\ndisappointment about his uncle’s will. The iron had not entered into\nhis soul, but he had begun to imagine what the sharp edge would be. It\ndid not once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth might be mistaken about Mr.\nFarebrother, but he suspected that she might be wrong about Mary. Mary\nhad been staying at the parsonage lately, and her mother might know\nvery little of what had been passing in her mind.He did not feel easier when he found her looking cheerful with the\nthree ladies in the drawing-room. They were in animated discussion on\nsome subject which was dropped when he entered, and Mary was copying\nthe labels from a heap of shallow cabinet drawers, in a minute\nhandwriting which she was skilled in. Mr. Farebrother was somewhere in\nthe village, and the three ladies knew nothing of Fred’s peculiar\nrelation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to propose that\nthey should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself that\nhe should have to go away without saying a word to her in private. He\ntold her first of Christy’s arrival and then of his own engagement with\nher father; and he was comforted by seeing that this latter news\ntouched her keenly. She said hurriedly, “I am so glad,” and then bent\nover her writing to hinder any one from noticing her face. But here was\na subject which Mrs. Farebrother could not let pass.“You don’t mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear of a\nyoung man giving up the Church for which he was educated: you only mean\nthat things being so, you are glad that he should be under an excellent\nman like your father.”“No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,” said Mary,\ncleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear. “I have a dreadfully\nsecular mind. I never liked any clergyman except the Vicar of Wakefield\nand Mr. Farebrother.”“Now why, my dear?” said Mrs. Farebrother, pausing on her large wooden\nknitting-needles and looking at Mary. “You have always a good reason\nfor your opinions, but this astonishes me. Of course I put out of the\nquestion those who preach new doctrine. But why should you dislike\nclergymen?”“Oh dear,” said Mary, her face breaking into merriment as she seemed to\nconsider a moment, “I don’t like their neckcloths.”“Why, you don’t like Camden’s, then,” said Miss Winifred, in some\nanxiety."

You would have better reasons than these for\nslighting so respectable a class of men,” said Mrs. Farebrother,\nmajestically.“Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be that it is\ndifficult to satisfy her,” said Fred.“Well, I am glad at least that she makes an exception in favor of my\nson,” said the old lady.Mary was wondering at Fred’s piqued tone, when Mr. Farebrother came in\nand had to hear the news about the engagement under Mr. Garth. At the\nend he said with quiet satisfaction, “_That_ is right;” and then bent\nto look at Mary’s labels and praise her handwriting. Fred felt horribly\njealous—was glad, of course, that Mr. Farebrother was so estimable, but\nwished that he had been ugly and fat as men at forty sometimes are. It\nwas clear what the end would be, since Mary openly placed Farebrother\nabove everybody, and these women were all evidently encouraging the\naffair. He was feeling sure that he should have no chance of speaking\nto Mary, when Mr. Farebrother said—“Fred, help me to carry these drawers back into my study—you have never\nseen my fine new study. Pray come too, Miss Garth. I want you to see a\nstupendous spider I found this morning.”Mary at once saw the Vicar’s intention. He had never since the\nmemorable evening deviated from his old pastoral kindness towards her,\nand her momentary wonder and doubt had quite gone to sleep. Mary was\naccustomed to think rather rigorously of what was probable, and if a\nbelief flattered her vanity she felt warned to dismiss it as\nridiculous, having early had much exercise in such dismissals. It was\nas she had foreseen: when Fred had been asked to admire the fittings of\nthe study, and she had been asked to admire the spider, Mr. Farebrother\nsaid—"

Nevertheless, the first word Fred said to Mary\nwas—“It is of no use, whatever I do, Mary. You are sure to marry\nFarebrother at last.” There was some rage in his tone.“What do you mean, Fred?” Mary exclaimed indignantly, blushing deeply,\nand surprised out of all her readiness in reply.“It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly enough—you who\nsee everything.”“I only see that you are behaving very ill, Fred, in speaking so of Mr.\nFarebrother after he has pleaded your cause in every way. How can you\nhave taken up such an idea?”Fred was rather deep, in spite of his irritation. If Mary had really\nbeen unsuspicious, there was no good in telling her what Mrs. Garth had\nsaid.“It follows as a matter of course,” he replied. “When you are\ncontinually seeing a man who beats me in everything, and whom you set\nup above everybody, I can have no fair chance.”“You are very ungrateful, Fred,” said Mary. “I wish I had never told\nMr. Farebrother that I cared for you in the least.”“No, I am not ungrateful; I should be the happiest fellow in the world\nif it were not for this. I told your father everything, and he was very\nkind; he treated me as if I were his son. I could go at the work with a\nwill, writing and everything, if it were not for this.”“For this? for what?” said Mary, imagining now that something specific\nmust have been said or done.“This dreadful certainty that I shall be bowled out by Farebrother.”\nMary was appeased by her inclination to laugh.“Fred,” she said, peeping round to catch his eyes, which were sulkily\nturned away from her, “you are too delightfully ridiculous. If you were\nnot such a charming simpleton, what a temptation this would be to play\nthe wicked coquette, and let you suppose that somebody besides you has\nmade love to me.”“Do you really like me best, Mary?” said Fred, turning eyes full of\naffection on her, and trying to take her hand."

And that is no argument that a very wise man\never will,” she ended, merrily.“I wish you would tell me that you could not possibly ever think of\nhim,” said Fred.“Never dare to mention this any more to me, Fred,” said Mary, getting\nserious again. “I don’t know whether it is more stupid or ungenerous in\nyou not to see that Mr. Farebrother has left us together on purpose\nthat we might speak freely. I am disappointed that you should be so\nblind to his delicate feeling.”There was no time to say any more before Mr. Farebrother came back with\nthe engraving; and Fred had to return to the drawing-room still with a\njealous dread in his heart, but yet with comforting arguments from\nMary’s words and manner. The result of the conversation was on the\nwhole more painful to Mary: inevitably her attention had taken a new\nattitude, and she saw the possibility of new interpretations. She was\nin a position in which she seemed to herself to be slighting Mr.\nFarebrother, and this, in relation to a man who is much honored, is\nalways dangerous to the firmness of a grateful woman. To have a reason\nfor going home the next day was a relief, for Mary earnestly desired to\nbe always clear that she loved Fred best. When a tender affection has\nbeen storing itself in us through many of our years, the idea that we\ncould accept any exchange for it seems to be a cheapening of our lives.\nAnd we can set a watch over our affections and our constancy as we can\nover other treasures.“Fred has lost all his other expectations; he must keep this,” Mary\nsaid to herself, with a smile curling her lips. It was impossible to\nhelp fleeting visions of another kind—new dignities and an acknowledged\nvalue of which she had often felt the absence. But these things with\nFred outside them, Fred forsaken and looking sad for the want of her,\ncould never tempt her deliberate thought.CHAPTER LVIII."
