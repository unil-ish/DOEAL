  "content": "Mr. Bambridge had more open manners, and appeared to give forth his\nideas without economy. He was loud, robust, and was sometimes spoken of\nas being “given to indulgence”—chiefly in swearing, drinking, and\nbeating his wife. Some people who had lost by him called him a vicious\nman; but he regarded horse-dealing as the finest of the arts, and might\nhave argued plausibly that it had nothing to do with morality. He was\nundeniably a prosperous man, bore his drinking better than others bore\ntheir moderation, and, on the whole, flourished like the green\nbay-tree. But his range of conversation was limited, and like the fine\nold tune, “Drops of brandy,” gave you after a while a sense of\nreturning upon itself in a way that might make weak heads dizzy. But a\nslight infusion of Mr. Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to\nseveral circles in Middlemarch; and he was a distinguished figure in\nthe bar and billiard-room at the Green Dragon. He knew some anecdotes\nabout the heroes of the turf, and various clever tricks of Marquesses\nand Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted its\npre-eminence even among black-legs; but the minute retentiveness of his\nmemory was chiefly shown about the horses he had himself bought and\nsold; the number of miles they would trot you in no time without\nturning a hair being, after the lapse of years, still a subject of\npassionate asseveration, in which he would assist the imagination of\nhis hearers by solemnly swearing that they never saw anything like it.\nIn short, Mr. Bambridge was a man of pleasure and a gay companion.Fred was subtle, and did not tell his friends that he was going to\nHoundsley bent on selling his horse: he wished to get indirectly at\ntheir genuine opinion of its value, not being aware that a genuine\nopinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such eminent\ncritics. It was not Mr. Bambridge’s weakness to be a gratuitous\nflatterer. He had never before been so much struck with the fact that\nthis unfortunate bay was a roarer to a degree which required the\nroundest word for perdition to give you any idea of it.“You made a bad hand at swapping when you went to anybody but me,\nVincy! Why, you never threw your leg across a finer horse than that\nchestnut, and you gave him for this brute. If you set him cantering, he\ngoes on like twenty sawyers. I never heard but one worse roarer in my\nlife, and that was a roan: it belonged to Pegwell, the corn-factor; he\nused to drive him in his gig seven years ago, and he wanted me to take\nhim, but I said, ‘Thank you, Peg, I don’t deal in wind-instruments.’\nThat was what I said. It went the round of the country, that joke did.\nBut, what the hell! the horse was a penny trumpet to that roarer of\nyours.”“Why, you said just now his was worse than mine,” said Fred, more\nirritable than usual.“I said a lie, then,” said Mr. Bambridge, emphatically. “There wasn’t a\npenny to choose between ’em.”Fred spurred his horse, and they trotted on a little way. When they\nslackened again, Mr. Bambridge said—“Not but what the roan was a better trotter than yours.”“I’m quite satisfied with his paces, I know,” said Fred, who required\nall the consciousness of being in gay company to support him; “I say\nhis trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?”Mr. Horrock looked before him with as complete a neutrality as if he\nhad been a portrait by a great master."

  "content": "That very evening, indeed, before the fair had set in, Fred thought he\nsaw a favorable opening for disposing advantageously of his horse, but\nan opening which made him congratulate himself on his foresight in\nbringing with him his eighty pounds. A young farmer, acquainted with\nMr. Bambridge, came into the Red Lion, and entered into conversation\nabout parting with a hunter, which he introduced at once as Diamond,\nimplying that it was a public character. For himself he only wanted a\nuseful hack, which would draw upon occasion; being about to marry and\nto give up hunting. The hunter was in a friend’s stable at some little\ndistance; there was still time for gentlemen to see it before dark. The\nfriend’s stable had to be reached through a back street where you might\nas easily have been poisoned without expense of drugs as in any grim\nstreet of that unsanitary period. Fred was not fortified against\ndisgust by brandy, as his companions were, but the hope of having at\nlast seen the horse that would enable him to make money was\nexhilarating enough to lead him over the same ground again the first\nthing in the morning. He felt sure that if he did not come to a bargain\nwith the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of circumstances, Fred\nfelt, was sharpening his acuteness and endowing him with all the\nconstructive power of suspicion. Bambridge had run down Diamond in a\nway that he never would have done (the horse being a friend’s) if he\nhad not thought of buying it; every one who looked at the animal—even\nHorrock—was evidently impressed with its merit. To get all the\nadvantage of being with men of this sort, you must know how to draw\nyour inferences, and not be a spoon who takes things literally. The\ncolor of the horse was a dappled gray, and Fred happened to know that\nLord Medlicote’s man was on the look-out for just such a horse. After\nall his running down, Bambridge let it out in the course of the\nevening, when the farmer was absent, that he had seen worse horses go\nfor eighty pounds. Of course he contradicted himself twenty times over,\nbut when you know what is likely to be true you can test a man’s\nadmissions. And Fred could not but reckon his own judgment of a horse\nas worth something. The farmer had paused over Fred’s respectable\nthough broken-winded steed long enough to show that he thought it worth\nconsideration, and it seemed probable that he would take it, with\nfive-and-twenty pounds in addition, as the equivalent of Diamond. In\nthat case Fred, when he had parted with his new horse for at least\neighty pounds, would be fifty-five pounds in pocket by the transaction,\nand would have a hundred and thirty-five pounds towards meeting the\nbill; so that the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at the\nutmost be twenty-five pounds. By the time he was hurrying on his\nclothes in the morning, he saw so clearly the importance of not losing\nthis rare chance, that if Bambridge and Horrock had both dissuaded him,\nhe would not have been deluded into a direct interpretation of their\npurpose: he would have been aware that those deep hands held something\nelse than a young fellow’s interest. With regard to horses, distrust\nwas your only clew. But scepticism, as we know, can never be thoroughly\napplied, else life would come to a standstill: something we must\nbelieve in and do, and whatever that something may be called, it is\nvirtually our own judgment, even when it seems like the most slavish\nreliance on another. Fred believed in the excellence of his bargain,\nand even before the fair had well set in, had got possession of the\ndappled gray, at the price of his old horse and thirty pounds in\naddition—only five pounds more than he had expected to give."

  "content": "I am sorry to say that only the third day after the propitious events\nat Houndsley Fred Vincy had fallen into worse spirits than he had known\nin his life before. Not that he had been disappointed as to the\npossible market for his horse, but that before the bargain could be\nconcluded with Lord Medlicote’s man, this Diamond, in which hope to the\namount of eighty pounds had been invested, had without the slightest\nwarning exhibited in the stable a most vicious energy in kicking, had\njust missed killing the groom, and had ended in laming himself severely\nby catching his leg in a rope that overhung the stable-board. There was\nno more redress for this than for the discovery of bad temper after\nmarriage—which of course old companions were aware of before the\nceremony. For some reason or other, Fred had none of his usual\nelasticity under this stroke of ill-fortune: he was simply aware that\nhe had only fifty pounds, that there was no chance of his getting any\nmore at present, and that the bill for a hundred and sixty would be\npresented in five days. Even if he had applied to his father on the\nplea that Mr. Garth should be saved from loss, Fred felt smartingly\nthat his father would angrily refuse to rescue Mr. Garth from the\nconsequence of what he would call encouraging extravagance and deceit.\nHe was so utterly downcast that he could frame no other project than to\ngo straight to Mr. Garth and tell him the sad truth, carrying with him\nthe fifty pounds, and getting that sum at least safely out of his own\nhands. His father, being at the warehouse, did not yet know of the\naccident: when he did, he would storm about the vicious brute being\nbrought into his stable; and before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred\nwanted to get away with all his courage to face the greater. He took\nhis father’s nag, for he had made up his mind that when he had told Mr.\nGarth, he would ride to Stone Court and confess all to Mary. In fact,\nit is probable that but for Mary’s existence and Fred’s love for her,\nhis conscience would have been much less active both in previously\nurging the debt on his thought and impelling him not to spare himself\nafter his usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task, but to act as\ndirectly and simply as he could. Even much stronger mortals than Fred\nVincy hold half their rectitude in the mind of the being they love\nbest. “The theatre of all my actions is fallen,” said an antique\npersonage when his chief friend was dead; and they are fortunate who\nget a theatre where the audience demands their best. Certainly it would\nhave made a considerable difference to Fred at that time if Mary Garth\nhad had no decided notions as to what was admirable in character."

  "content": "Mr. Garth was not at the office, and Fred rode on to his house, which\nwas a little way outside the town—a homely place with an orchard in\nfront of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered building, which\nbefore the town had spread had been a farm-house, but was now\nsurrounded with the private gardens of the townsmen. We get the fonder\nof our houses if they have a physiognomy of their own, as our friends\nhave. The Garth family, which was rather a large one, for Mary had four\nbrothers and one sister, were very fond of their old house, from which\nall the best furniture had long been sold. Fred liked it too, knowing\nit by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and\nquinces, and until to-day he had never come to it without pleasant\nexpectations; but his heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he\nshould probably have to make his confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom\nhe was rather more in awe than of her husband. Not that she was\ninclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was. In her\npresent matronly age at least, Mrs. Garth never committed herself by\nover-hasty speech; having, as she said, borne the yoke in her youth,\nand learned self-control. She had that rare sense which discerns what\nis unalterable, and submits to it without murmuring. Adoring her\nhusband’s virtues, she had very early made up her mind to his\nincapacity of minding his own interests, and had met the consequences\ncheerfully. She had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in\nteapots or children’s frilling, and had never poured any pathetic\nconfidences into the ears of her feminine neighbors concerning Mr.\nGarth’s want of prudence and the sums he might have had if he had been\nlike other men. Hence these fair neighbors thought her either proud or\neccentric, and sometimes spoke of her to their husbands as “your fine\nMrs. Garth.” She was not without her criticism of them in return, being\nmore accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and—where\nis the blameless woman?—apt to be a little severe towards her own sex,\nwhich in her opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate. On the\nother hand, she was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings\nof men, and was often heard to say that these were natural. Also, it\nmust be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too emphatic in her\nresistance to what she held to be follies: the passage from governess\ninto housewife had wrought itself a little too strongly into her\nconsciousness, and she rarely forgot that while her grammar and accent\nwere above the town standard, she wore a plain cap, cooked the family\ndinner, and darned all the stockings. She had sometimes taken pupils in\na peripatetic fashion, making them follow her about in the kitchen with\ntheir book or slate. She thought it good for them to see that she could\nmake an excellent lather while she corrected their blunders “without\nlooking,”—that a woman with her sleeves tucked up above her elbows\nmight know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone—that, in\nshort, she might possess “education” and other good things ending in\n“tion,” and worthy to be pronounced emphatically, without being a\nuseless doll. When she made remarks to this edifying effect, she had a\nfirm little frown on her brow, which yet did not hinder her face from\nlooking benevolent, and her words which came forth like a procession\nwere uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto. Certainly, the exemplary\nMrs. Garth had her droll aspects, but her character sustained her\noddities, as a very fine wine sustains a flavor of skin."

  "content": "Towards Fred Vincy she had a motherly feeling, and had always been\ndisposed to excuse his errors, though she would probably not have\nexcused Mary for engaging herself to him, her daughter being included\nin that more rigorous judgment which she applied to her own sex. But\nthis very fact of her exceptional indulgence towards him made it the\nharder to Fred that he must now inevitably sink in her opinion. And the\ncircumstances of his visit turned out to be still more unpleasant than\nhe had expected; for Caleb Garth had gone out early to look at some\nrepairs not far off. Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in the\nkitchen, and this morning she was carrying on several occupations at\nonce there—making her pies at the well-scoured deal table on one side\nof that airy room, observing Sally’s movements at the oven and\ndough-tub through an open door, and giving lessons to her youngest boy\nand girl, who were standing opposite to her at the table with their\nbooks and slates before them. A tub and a clothes-horse at the other\nend of the kitchen indicated an intermittent wash of small things also\ngoing on.Mrs. Garth, with her sleeves turned above her elbows, deftly handling\nher pastry—applying her rolling-pin and giving ornamental pinches,\nwhile she expounded with grammatical fervor what were the right views\nabout the concord of verbs and pronouns with “nouns of multitude or\nsignifying many,” was a sight agreeably amusing. She was of the same\ncurly-haired, square-faced type as Mary, but handsomer, with more\ndelicacy of feature, a pale skin, a solid matronly figure, and a\nremarkable firmness of glance. In her snowy-frilled cap she reminded\none of that delightful Frenchwoman whom we have all seen marketing,\nbasket on arm. Looking at the mother, you might hope that the daughter\nwould become like her, which is a prospective advantage equal to a\ndowry—the mother too often standing behind the daughter like a\nmalignant prophecy—“Such as I am, she will shortly be.”"

What’s the use of it?”“To teach you to speak and write correctly, so that you can be\nunderstood,” said Mrs. Garth, with severe precision. “Should you like\nto speak as old Job does?”“Yes,” said Ben, stoutly; “it’s funnier. He says, ‘Yo goo’—that’s just\nas good as ‘You go.’”“But he says, ‘A ship’s in the garden,’ instead of ‘a sheep,’” said\nLetty, with an air of superiority. “You might think he meant a ship off\nthe sea.”“No, you mightn’t, if you weren’t silly,” said Ben. “How could a ship\noff the sea come there?”“These things belong only to pronunciation, which is the least part of\ngrammar,” said Mrs. Garth. “That apple-peel is to be eaten by the pigs,\nBen; if you eat it, I must give them your piece of pasty. Job has only\nto speak about very plain things. How do you think you would write or\nspeak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar\nthan he does? You would use wrong words, and put words in the wrong\nplaces, and instead of making people understand you, they would turn\naway from you as a tiresome person. What would you do then?”“I shouldn’t care, I should leave off,” said Ben, with a sense that\nthis was an agreeable issue where grammar was concerned.“I see you are getting tired and stupid, Ben,” said Mrs. Garth,\naccustomed to these obstructive arguments from her male offspring.\nHaving finished her pies, she moved towards the clothes-horse, and\nsaid, “Come here and tell me the story I told you on Wednesday, about\nCincinnatus.”“I know! he was a farmer,” said Ben.“Now, Ben, he was a Roman—let _me_ tell,” said Letty, using her elbow\ncontentiously.“You silly thing, he was a Roman farmer, and he was ploughing.”“Yes, but before that—that didn’t come first—people wanted him,” said\nLetty."

  "content": "“Well, but you must say what sort of a man he was first,” insisted Ben.\n“He was a wise man, like my father, and that made the people want his\nadvice. And he was a brave man, and could fight. And so could my\nfather—couldn’t he, mother?”“Now, Ben, let me tell the story straight on, as mother told it us,”\nsaid Letty, frowning. “Please, mother, tell Ben not to speak.”“Letty, I am ashamed of you,” said her mother, wringing out the caps\nfrom the tub. “When your brother began, you ought to have waited to see\nif he could not tell the story. How rude you look, pushing and\nfrowning, as if you wanted to conquer with your elbows! Cincinnatus, I\nam sure, would have been sorry to see his daughter behave so.” (Mrs.\nGarth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation,\nand Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem,\nthat of the Romans inclusive, life was already a painful affair.) “Now,\nBen.”“Well—oh—well—why, there was a great deal of fighting, and they were\nall blockheads, and—I can’t tell it just how you told it—but they\nwanted a man to be captain and king and everything—”“Dictator, now,” said Letty, with injured looks, and not without a wish\nto make her mother repent.“Very well, dictator!” said Ben, contemptuously. “But that isn’t a good\nword: he didn’t tell them to write on slates.”“Come, come, Ben, you are not so ignorant as that,” said Mrs. Garth,\ncarefully serious. “Hark, there is a knock at the door! Run, Letty, and\nopen it.”The knock was Fred’s; and when Letty said that her father was not in\nyet, but that her mother was in the kitchen, Fred had no alternative.\nHe could not depart from his usual practice of going to see Mrs. Garth\nin the kitchen if she happened to be at work there. He put his arm\nround Letty’s neck silently, and led her into the kitchen without his\nusual jokes and caresses.Mrs. Garth was surprised to see Fred at this hour, but surprise was not\na feeling that she was given to express, and she only said, quietly\ncontinuing her work—“You, Fred, so early in the day? You look quite pale. Has anything\nhappened?”"

Do you mind staying with me, while I finish my matters here?”“But we needn’t go on about Cincinnatus, need we?” said Ben, who had\ntaken Fred’s whip out of his hand, and was trying its efficiency on the\ncat.“No, go out now. But put that whip down. How very mean of you to whip\npoor old Tortoise! Pray take the whip from him, Fred.”“Come, old boy, give it me,” said Fred, putting out his hand.“Will you let me ride on your horse to-day?” said Ben, rendering up the\nwhip, with an air of not being obliged to do it.“Not to-day—another time. I am not riding my own horse.”“Shall you see Mary to-day?”“Yes, I think so,” said Fred, with an unpleasant twinge.“Tell her to come home soon, and play at forfeits, and make fun.”“Enough, enough, Ben! run away,” said Mrs. Garth, seeing that Fred was\nteased.“Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, Mrs. Garth?” said Fred, when\nthe children were gone and it was needful to say something that would\npass the time. He was not yet sure whether he should wait for Mr.\nGarth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to Mrs.\nGarth herself, give her the money and ride away.“One—only one. Fanny Hackbutt comes at half past eleven. I am not\ngetting a great income now,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling. “I am at a low\nebb with pupils.

There he is! I hear him coming in.\nWe will go to him in the parlor, shall we?”When they entered the parlor Caleb had thrown down his hat and was\nseated at his desk.“What! Fred, my boy!” he said, in a tone of mild surprise, holding his\npen still undipped; “you are here betimes.” But missing the usual\nexpression of cheerful greeting in Fred’s face, he immediately added,\n“Is there anything up at home?—anything the matter?”“Yes, Mr. Garth, I am come to tell something that I am afraid will give\nyou a bad opinion of me. I am come to tell you and Mrs. Garth that I\ncan’t keep my word. I can’t find the money to meet the bill after all.\nI have been unfortunate; I have only got these fifty pounds towards the\nhundred and sixty.”While Fred was speaking, he had taken out the notes and laid them on\nthe desk before Mr. Garth. He had burst forth at once with the plain\nfact, feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal resources. Mrs.\nGarth was mutely astonished, and looked at her husband for an\nexplanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause said—“Oh, I didn’t tell you, Susan: I put my name to a bill for Fred; it was\nfor a hundred and sixty pounds. He made sure he could meet it himself.”There was an evident change in Mrs. Garth’s face, but it was like a\nchange below the surface of water which remains smooth. She fixed her\neyes on Fred, saying—“I suppose you have asked your father for the rest of the money and he\nhas refused you.”“No,” said Fred, biting his lip, and speaking with more difficulty;\n“but I know it will be of no use to ask him; and unless it were of use,\nI should not like to mention Mr. Garth’s name in the matter.”“It has come at an unfortunate time,” said Caleb, in his hesitating\nway, looking down at the notes and nervously fingering the paper,\n“Christmas upon us—I’m rather hard up just now.

She will advance it.”Mrs. Garth had not again looked at Fred, and was not in the least\ncalculating what words she should use to cut him the most effectively.\nLike the eccentric woman she was, she was at present absorbed in\nconsidering what was to be done, and did not fancy that the end could\nbe better achieved by bitter remarks or explosions. But she had made\nFred feel for the first time something like the tooth of remorse.\nCuriously enough, his pain in the affair beforehand had consisted\nalmost entirely in the sense that he must seem dishonorable, and sink\nin the opinion of the Garths: he had not occupied himself with the\ninconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion them,\nfor this exercise of the imagination on other people’s needs is not\ncommon with hopeful young gentlemen. Indeed we are most of us brought\nup in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is\nsomething irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong.

They could see him mount, and\nquickly pass through the gate.“I am disappointed in Fred Vincy,” said Mrs. Garth. “I would not have\nbelieved beforehand that he would have drawn you into his debts. I knew\nhe was extravagant, but I did not think that he would be so mean as to\nhang his risks on his oldest friend, who could the least afford to\nlose.”“I was a fool, Susan.”“That you were,” said the wife, nodding and smiling. “But I should not\nhave gone to publish it in the market-place. Why should you keep such\nthings from me? It is just so with your buttons: you let them burst off\nwithout telling me, and go out with your wristband hanging. If I had\nonly known I might have been ready with some better plan.”“You are sadly cut up, I know, Susan,” said Caleb, looking feelingly at\nher. “I can’t abide your losing the money you’ve scraped together for\nAlfred.”“It is very well that I _had_ scraped it together; and it is you who\nwill have to suffer, for you must teach the boy yourself. You must give\nup your bad habits. Some men take to drinking, and you have taken to\nworking without pay. You must indulge yourself a little less in that.\nAnd you must ride over to Mary, and ask the child what money she has.”Caleb had pushed his chair back, and was leaning forward, shaking his\nhead slowly, and fitting his finger-tips together with much nicety.“Poor Mary!” he said. “Susan,” he went on in a lowered tone, “I’m\nafraid she may be fond of Fred.”“Oh no! She always laughs at him; and he is not likely to think of her\nin any other than a brotherly way.”Caleb made no rejoinder, but presently lowered his spectacles, drew up\nhis chair to the desk, and said, “Deuce take the bill—I wish it was at\nHanover! These things are a sad interruption to business!”"

  "content": "The first part of this speech comprised his whole store of maledictory\nexpression, and was uttered with a slight snarl easy to imagine. But it\nwould be difficult to convey to those who never heard him utter the\nword “business,” the peculiar tone of fervid veneration, of religious\nregard, in which he wrapped it, as a consecrated symbol is wrapped in\nits gold-fringed linen.Caleb Garth often shook his head in meditation on the value, the\nindispensable might of that myriad-headed, myriad-handed labor by which\nthe social body is fed, clothed, and housed. It had laid hold of his\nimagination in boyhood. The echoes of the great hammer where roof or\nkeel were a-making, the signal-shouts of the workmen, the roar of the\nfurnace, the thunder and plash of the engine, were a sublime music to\nhim; the felling and lading of timber, and the huge trunk vibrating\nstar-like in the distance along the highway, the crane at work on the\nwharf, the piled-up produce in warehouses, the precision and variety of\nmuscular effort wherever exact work had to be turned out,—all these\nsights of his youth had acted on him as poetry without the aid of the\npoets, had made a philosophy for him without the aid of philosophers, a\nreligion without the aid of theology. His early ambition had been to\nhave as effective a share as possible in this sublime labor, which was\npeculiarly dignified by him with the name of “business;” and though he\nhad only been a short time under a surveyor, and had been chiefly his\nown teacher, he knew more of land, building, and mining than most of\nthe special men in the county."

  "content": "His classification of human employments was rather crude, and, like the\ncategories of more celebrated men, would not be acceptable in these\nadvanced times. He divided them into “business, politics, preaching,\nlearning, and amusement.” He had nothing to say against the last four;\nbut he regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than\nhis own. In the same way, he thought very well of all ranks, but he\nwould not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he had not such\nclose contact with “business” as to get often honorably decorated with\nmarks of dust and mortar, the damp of the engine, or the sweet soil of\nthe woods and fields. Though he had never regarded himself as other\nthan an orthodox Christian, and would argue on prevenient grace if the\nsubject were proposed to him, I think his virtual divinities were good\npractical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of\nundertakings: his prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there was\nno spirit of denial in Caleb, and the world seemed so wondrous to him\nthat he was ready to accept any number of systems, like any number of\nfirmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best\nland-drainage, solid building, correct measuring, and judicious boring\n(for coal). In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong practical\nintelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but\nhe had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of\nprofit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined\nto give up all forms of his beloved “business” which required that\ntalent. He gave himself up entirely to the many kinds of work which he\ncould do without handling capital, and was one of those precious men\nwithin his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them,\nbecause he did his work well, charged very little, and often declined\nto charge at all. It is no wonder, then, that the Garths were poor, and\n“lived in a small way.” However, they did not mind it."

BLAKE: _Songs of Experience_.Fred Vincy wanted to arrive at Stone Court when Mary could not expect\nhim, and when his uncle was not downstairs: in that case she might be\nsitting alone in the wainscoted parlor. He left his horse in the yard\nto avoid making a noise on the gravel in front, and entered the parlor\nwithout other notice than the noise of the door-handle. Mary was in her\nusual corner, laughing over Mrs. Piozzi’s recollections of Johnson, and\nlooked up with the fun still in her face. It gradually faded as she saw\nFred approach her without speaking, and stand before her with his elbow\non the mantel-piece, looking ill. She too was silent, only raising her\neyes to him inquiringly.“Mary,” he began, “I am a good-for-nothing blackguard.”“I should think one of those epithets would do at a time,” said Mary,\ntrying to smile, but feeling alarmed.“I know you will never think well of me any more. You will think me a\nliar. You will think me dishonest. You will think I didn’t care for\nyou, or your father and mother. You always do make the worst of me, I\nknow.”“I cannot deny that I shall think all that of you, Fred, if you give me\ngood reasons. But please to tell me at once what you have done. I would\nrather know the painful truth than imagine it.”"

I made sure\nof paying the money myself, and I have tried as hard as I could. And\nnow, I have been so unlucky—a horse has turned out badly—I can only pay\nfifty pounds. And I can’t ask my father for the money: he would not\ngive me a farthing. And my uncle gave me a hundred a little while ago.\nSo what can I do? And now your father has no ready money to spare, and\nyour mother will have to pay away her ninety-two pounds that she has\nsaved, and she says your savings must go too. You see what a—”“Oh, poor mother, poor father!” said Mary, her eyes filling with tears,\nand a little sob rising which she tried to repress. She looked straight\nbefore her and took no notice of Fred, all the consequences at home\nbecoming present to her. He too remained silent for some moments,\nfeeling more miserable than ever. “I wouldn’t have hurt you for the\nworld, Mary,” he said at last. “You can never forgive me.”“What does it matter whether I forgive you?” said Mary, passionately.\n“Would that make it any better for my mother to lose the money she has\nbeen earning by lessons for four years, that she might send Alfred to\nMr. Hanmer’s? Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave\nyou?”“Say what you like, Mary. I deserve it all.”“I don’t want to say anything,” said Mary, more quietly, “and my anger\nis of no use.” She dried her eyes, threw aside her book, rose and\nfetched her sewing.Fred followed her with his eyes, hoping that they would meet hers, and\nin that way find access for his imploring penitence. But no! Mary could\neasily avoid looking upward.“I do care about your mother’s money going,” he said, when she was\nseated again and sewing quickly. “I wanted to ask you, Mary—don’t you\nthink that Mr. Featherstone—if you were to tell him—tell him, I mean,\nabout apprenticing Alfred—would advance the money?”“My family is not fond of begging, Fred. We would rather work for our\nmoney. Besides, you say that Mr. Featherstone has lately given you a\nhundred pounds. He rarely makes presents; he has never made presents to\nus. I am sure my father will not ask him for anything; and even if I\nchose to beg of him, it would be of no use.”“I am so miserable, Mary—if you knew how miserable I am, you would be\nsorry for me.”“There are other things to be more sorry for than that. But selfish\npeople always think their own discomfort of more importance than\nanything else in the world. I see enough of that every day.”"

If you knew what things other\nyoung men do, you would think me a good way off the worst.”“I know that people who spend a great deal of money on themselves\nwithout knowing how they shall pay, must be selfish. They are always\nthinking of what they can get for themselves, and not of what other\npeople may lose.”“Any man may be unfortunate, Mary, and find himself unable to pay when\nhe meant it. There is not a better man in the world than your father,\nand yet he got into trouble.”“How dare you make any comparison between my father and you, Fred?”\nsaid Mary, in a deep tone of indignation. “He never got into trouble by\nthinking of his own idle pleasures, but because he was always thinking\nof the work he was doing for other people. And he has fared hard, and\nworked hard to make good everybody’s loss.”“And you think that I shall never try to make good anything, Mary. It\nis not generous to believe the worst of a man. When you have got any\npower over him, I think you might try and use it to make him better;\nbut that is what you never do. However, I’m going,” Fred ended,\nlanguidly. “I shall never speak to you about anything again. I’m very\nsorry for all the trouble I’ve caused—that’s all.”Mary had dropped her work out of her hand and looked up. There is often\nsomething maternal even in a girlish love, and Mary’s hard experience\nhad wrought her nature to an impressibility very different from that\nhard slight thing which we call girlishness. At Fred’s last words she\nfelt an instantaneous pang, something like what a mother feels at the\nimagined sobs or cries of her naughty truant child, which may lose\nitself and get harm. And when, looking up, her eyes met his dull\ndespairing glance, her pity for him surmounted her anger and all her\nother anxieties."

He has been wondering that he has not\nseen you for a whole week.” Mary spoke hurriedly, saying the words that\ncame first without knowing very well what they were, but saying them in\na half-soothing half-beseeching tone, and rising as if to go away to\nMr. Featherstone. Of course Fred felt as if the clouds had parted and a\ngleam had come: he moved and stood in her way.“Say one word, Mary, and I will do anything. Say you will not think the\nworst of me—will not give me up altogether.”“As if it were any pleasure to me to think ill of you,” said Mary, in a\nmournful tone. “As if it were not very painful to me to see you an idle\nfrivolous creature. How can you bear to be so contemptible, when others\nare working and striving, and there are so many things to be done—how\ncan you bear to be fit for nothing in the world that is useful? And\nwith so much good in your disposition, Fred,—you might be worth a great\ndeal.”“I will try to be anything you like, Mary, if you will say that you\nlove me.”“I should be ashamed to say that I loved a man who must always be\nhanging on others, and reckoning on what they would do for him. What\nwill you be when you are forty? Like Mr. Bowyer, I suppose—just as\nidle, living in Mrs. Beck’s front parlor—fat and shabby, hoping\nsomebody will invite you to dinner—spending your morning in learning a\ncomic song—oh no! learning a tune on the flute.”Mary’s lips had begun to curl with a smile as soon as she had asked\nthat question about Fred’s future (young souls are mobile), and before\nshe ended, her face had its full illumination of fun. To him it was\nlike the cessation of an ache that Mary could laugh at him, and with a\npassive sort of smile he tried to reach her hand; but she slipped away\nquickly towards the door and said, “I shall tell uncle. You _must_ see\nhim for a moment or two.”"

He never dared in\nMary’s presence to approach the subject of his expectations from Mr.\nFeatherstone, and she always ignored them, as if everything depended on\nhimself. But if ever he actually came into the property, she must\nrecognize the change in his position. All this passed through his mind\nsomewhat languidly, before he went up to see his uncle. He stayed but a\nlittle while, excusing himself on the ground that he had a cold; and\nMary did not reappear before he left the house. But as he rode home, he\nbegan to be more conscious of being ill, than of being melancholy.When Caleb Garth arrived at Stone Court soon after dusk, Mary was not\nsurprised, although he seldom had leisure for paying her a visit, and\nwas not at all fond of having to talk with Mr. Featherstone. The old\nman, on the other hand, felt himself ill at ease with a brother-in-law\nwhom he could not annoy, who did not mind about being considered poor,\nhad nothing to ask of him, and understood all kinds of farming and\nmining business better than he did. But Mary had felt sure that her\nparents would want to see her, and if her father had not come, she\nwould have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day.\nAfter discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone, Caleb rose to\nbid him good-by, and said, “I want to speak to you, Mary.”She took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no fire,\nand setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table, turned\nround to her father, and putting her arms round his neck kissed him\nwith childish kisses which he delighted in,—the expression of his large\nbrows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog softens when\nit is caressed. Mary was his favorite child, and whatever Susan might\nsay, and right as she was on all other subjects, Caleb thought it\nnatural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more lovable than\nother girls.“I’ve got something to tell you, my dear,” said Caleb in his hesitating\nway. “No very good news; but then it might be worse.”“About money, father? I think I know what it is.”“Ay? how can that be? You see, I’ve been a bit of a fool again, and put\nmy name to a bill, and now it comes to paying; and your mother has got\nto part with her savings, that’s the worst of it, and even they won’t\nquite make things even.

Did he come on purpose?”“Yes, I think so. He was a good deal distressed.”“I’m afraid Fred is not to be trusted, Mary,” said the father, with\nhesitating tenderness. “He means better than he acts, perhaps. But I\nshould think it a pity for any body’s happiness to be wrapped up in\nhim, and so would your mother.”“And so should I, father,” said Mary, not looking up, but putting the\nback of her father’s hand against her cheek.“I don’t want to pry, my dear. But I was afraid there might be\nsomething between you and Fred, and I wanted to caution you. You see,\nMary”—here Caleb’s voice became more tender; he had been pushing his\nhat about on the table and looking at it, but finally he turned his\neyes on his daughter—“a woman, let her be as good as she may, has got\nto put up with the life her husband makes for her.

That’s the long and the\nshort of it, Mary. Young folks may get fond of each other before they\nknow what life is, and they may think it all holiday if they can only\nget together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear. However, you\nhave more sense than most, and you haven’t been kept in cotton-wool:\nthere may be no occasion for me to say this, but a father trembles for\nhis daughter, and you are all by yourself here.”“Don’t fear for me, father,” said Mary, gravely meeting her father’s\neyes; “Fred has always been very good to me; he is kind-hearted and\naffectionate, and not false, I think, with all his self-indulgence. But\nI will never engage myself to one who has no manly independence, and\nwho goes on loitering away his time on the chance that others will\nprovide for him.

Then I am easy,” said Mr. Garth, taking up\nhis hat. “But it’s hard to run away with your earnings, eh child.”“Father!” said Mary, in her deepest tone of remonstrance. “Take\npocketfuls of love besides to them all at home,” was her last word\nbefore he closed the outer door on himself.“I suppose your father wanted your earnings,” said old Mr.\nFeatherstone, with his usual power of unpleasant surmise, when Mary\nreturned to him. “He makes but a tight fit, I reckon. You’re of age\nnow; you ought to be saving for yourself.”“I consider my father and mother the best part of myself, sir,” said\nMary, coldly.Mr. Featherstone grunted: he could not deny that an ordinary sort of\ngirl like her might be expected to be useful, so he thought of another\nrejoinder, disagreeable enough to be always apropos. “If Fred Vincy\ncomes to-morrow, now, don’t you keep him chattering: let him come up to\nme.”CHAPTER XXVI.He beats me and I rail at him: O worthy satisfaction! would it were\notherwise—that I could beat him while he railed at me.—_Troilus and\nCressida_."
