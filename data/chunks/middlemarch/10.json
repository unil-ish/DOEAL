  "content": "Towards Fred Vincy she had a motherly feeling, and had always been\ndisposed to excuse his errors, though she would probably not have\nexcused Mary for engaging herself to him, her daughter being included\nin that more rigorous judgment which she applied to her own sex. But\nthis very fact of her exceptional indulgence towards him made it the\nharder to Fred that he must now inevitably sink in her opinion. And the\ncircumstances of his visit turned out to be still more unpleasant than\nhe had expected; for Caleb Garth had gone out early to look at some\nrepairs not far off. Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in the\nkitchen, and this morning she was carrying on several occupations at\nonce there—making her pies at the well-scoured deal table on one side\nof that airy room, observing Sally’s movements at the oven and\ndough-tub through an open door, and giving lessons to her youngest boy\nand girl, who were standing opposite to her at the table with their\nbooks and slates before them. A tub and a clothes-horse at the other\nend of the kitchen indicated an intermittent wash of small things also\ngoing on.Mrs. Garth, with her sleeves turned above her elbows, deftly handling\nher pastry—applying her rolling-pin and giving ornamental pinches,\nwhile she expounded with grammatical fervor what were the right views\nabout the concord of verbs and pronouns with “nouns of multitude or\nsignifying many,” was a sight agreeably amusing. She was of the same\ncurly-haired, square-faced type as Mary, but handsomer, with more\ndelicacy of feature, a pale skin, a solid matronly figure, and a\nremarkable firmness of glance. In her snowy-frilled cap she reminded\none of that delightful Frenchwoman whom we have all seen marketing,\nbasket on arm. Looking at the mother, you might hope that the daughter\nwould become like her, which is a prospective advantage equal to a\ndowry—the mother too often standing behind the daughter like a\nmalignant prophecy—“Such as I am, she will shortly be.”"

  "content": "“Now let us go through that once more,” said Mrs. Garth, pinching an\napple-puff which seemed to distract Ben, an energetic young male with a\nheavy brow, from due attention to the lesson. “‘Not without regard to\nthe import of the word as conveying unity or plurality of idea’—tell me\nagain what that means, Ben.”(Mrs. Garth, like more celebrated educators, had her favorite ancient\npaths, and in a general wreck of society would have tried to hold her\n“Lindley Murray” above the waves.)“Oh—it means—you must think what you mean,” said Ben, rather peevishly.\n“I hate grammar. What’s the use of it?”“To teach you to speak and write correctly, so that you can be\nunderstood,” said Mrs. Garth, with severe precision. “Should you like\nto speak as old Job does?”“Yes,” said Ben, stoutly; “it’s funnier. He says, ‘Yo goo’—that’s just\nas good as ‘You go.’”“But he says, ‘A ship’s in the garden,’ instead of ‘a sheep,’” said\nLetty, with an air of superiority. “You might think he meant a ship off\nthe sea.”“No, you mightn’t, if you weren’t silly,” said Ben. “How could a ship\noff the sea come there?”“These things belong only to pronunciation, which is the least part of\ngrammar,” said Mrs. Garth. “That apple-peel is to be eaten by the pigs,\nBen; if you eat it, I must give them your piece of pasty. Job has only\nto speak about very plain things. How do you think you would write or\nspeak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar\nthan he does? You would use wrong words, and put words in the wrong\nplaces, and instead of making people understand you, they would turn\naway from you as a tiresome person. What would you do then?”“I shouldn’t care, I should leave off,” said Ben, with a sense that\nthis was an agreeable issue where grammar was concerned.“I see you are getting tired and stupid, Ben,” said Mrs. Garth,\naccustomed to these obstructive arguments from her male offspring.\nHaving finished her pies, she moved towards the clothes-horse, and\nsaid, “Come here and tell me the story I told you on Wednesday, about\nCincinnatus.”“I know! he was a farmer,” said Ben.“Now, Ben, he was a Roman—let _me_ tell,” said Letty, using her elbow\ncontentiously.“You silly thing, he was a Roman farmer, and he was ploughing.”“Yes, but before that—that didn’t come first—people wanted him,” said\nLetty."

  "content": "“Well, but you must say what sort of a man he was first,” insisted Ben.\n“He was a wise man, like my father, and that made the people want his\nadvice. And he was a brave man, and could fight. And so could my\nfather—couldn’t he, mother?”“Now, Ben, let me tell the story straight on, as mother told it us,”\nsaid Letty, frowning. “Please, mother, tell Ben not to speak.”“Letty, I am ashamed of you,” said her mother, wringing out the caps\nfrom the tub. “When your brother began, you ought to have waited to see\nif he could not tell the story. How rude you look, pushing and\nfrowning, as if you wanted to conquer with your elbows! Cincinnatus, I\nam sure, would have been sorry to see his daughter behave so.” (Mrs.\nGarth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation,\nand Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem,\nthat of the Romans inclusive, life was already a painful affair.) “Now,\nBen.”“Well—oh—well—why, there was a great deal of fighting, and they were\nall blockheads, and—I can’t tell it just how you told it—but they\nwanted a man to be captain and king and everything—”“Dictator, now,” said Letty, with injured looks, and not without a wish\nto make her mother repent.“Very well, dictator!” said Ben, contemptuously. “But that isn’t a good\nword: he didn’t tell them to write on slates.”“Come, come, Ben, you are not so ignorant as that,” said Mrs. Garth,\ncarefully serious. “Hark, there is a knock at the door! Run, Letty, and\nopen it.”The knock was Fred’s; and when Letty said that her father was not in\nyet, but that her mother was in the kitchen, Fred had no alternative.\nHe could not depart from his usual practice of going to see Mrs. Garth\nin the kitchen if she happened to be at work there. He put his arm\nround Letty’s neck silently, and led her into the kitchen without his\nusual jokes and caresses.Mrs. Garth was surprised to see Fred at this hour, but surprise was not\na feeling that she was given to express, and she only said, quietly\ncontinuing her work—“You, Fred, so early in the day? You look quite pale. Has anything\nhappened?”"

Do you mind staying with me, while I finish my matters here?”“But we needn’t go on about Cincinnatus, need we?” said Ben, who had\ntaken Fred’s whip out of his hand, and was trying its efficiency on the\ncat.“No, go out now. But put that whip down. How very mean of you to whip\npoor old Tortoise! Pray take the whip from him, Fred.”“Come, old boy, give it me,” said Fred, putting out his hand.“Will you let me ride on your horse to-day?” said Ben, rendering up the\nwhip, with an air of not being obliged to do it.“Not to-day—another time. I am not riding my own horse.”“Shall you see Mary to-day?”“Yes, I think so,” said Fred, with an unpleasant twinge.“Tell her to come home soon, and play at forfeits, and make fun.”“Enough, enough, Ben! run away,” said Mrs. Garth, seeing that Fred was\nteased.“Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, Mrs. Garth?” said Fred, when\nthe children were gone and it was needful to say something that would\npass the time. He was not yet sure whether he should wait for Mr.\nGarth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to Mrs.\nGarth herself, give her the money and ride away.“One—only one. Fanny Hackbutt comes at half past eleven. I am not\ngetting a great income now,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling. “I am at a low\nebb with pupils. But I have saved my little purse for Alfred’s premium:\nI have ninety-two pounds. He can go to Mr. Hanmer’s now; he is just at\nthe right age.”"

  "content": "This did not lead well towards the news that Mr. Garth was on the brink\nof losing ninety-two pounds and more. Fred was silent. “Young gentlemen\nwho go to college are rather more costly than that,” Mrs. Garth\ninnocently continued, pulling out the edging on a cap-border. “And\nCaleb thinks that Alfred will turn out a distinguished engineer: he\nwants to give the boy a good chance. There he is! I hear him coming in.\nWe will go to him in the parlor, shall we?”When they entered the parlor Caleb had thrown down his hat and was\nseated at his desk.“What! Fred, my boy!” he said, in a tone of mild surprise, holding his\npen still undipped; “you are here betimes.” But missing the usual\nexpression of cheerful greeting in Fred’s face, he immediately added,\n“Is there anything up at home?—anything the matter?”“Yes, Mr. Garth, I am come to tell something that I am afraid will give\nyou a bad opinion of me. I am come to tell you and Mrs. Garth that I\ncan’t keep my word. I can’t find the money to meet the bill after all.\nI have been unfortunate; I have only got these fifty pounds towards the\nhundred and sixty.”While Fred was speaking, he had taken out the notes and laid them on\nthe desk before Mr. Garth. He had burst forth at once with the plain\nfact, feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal resources. Mrs.\nGarth was mutely astonished, and looked at her husband for an\nexplanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause said—“Oh, I didn’t tell you, Susan: I put my name to a bill for Fred; it was\nfor a hundred and sixty pounds. He made sure he could meet it himself.”There was an evident change in Mrs. Garth’s face, but it was like a\nchange below the surface of water which remains smooth. She fixed her\neyes on Fred, saying—“I suppose you have asked your father for the rest of the money and he\nhas refused you.”“No,” said Fred, biting his lip, and speaking with more difficulty;\n“but I know it will be of no use to ask him; and unless it were of use,\nI should not like to mention Mr. Garth’s name in the matter.”“It has come at an unfortunate time,” said Caleb, in his hesitating\nway, looking down at the notes and nervously fingering the paper,\n“Christmas upon us—I’m rather hard up just now. You see, I have to cut\nout everything like a tailor with short measure. What can we do, Susan?\nI shall want every farthing we have in the bank. It’s a hundred and ten\npounds, the deuce take it!”"

  "content": "“I must give you the ninety-two pounds that I have put by for Alfred’s\npremium,” said Mrs. Garth, gravely and decisively, though a nice ear\nmight have discerned a slight tremor in some of the words. “And I have\nno doubt that Mary has twenty pounds saved from her salary by this\ntime. She will advance it.”Mrs. Garth had not again looked at Fred, and was not in the least\ncalculating what words she should use to cut him the most effectively.\nLike the eccentric woman she was, she was at present absorbed in\nconsidering what was to be done, and did not fancy that the end could\nbe better achieved by bitter remarks or explosions. But she had made\nFred feel for the first time something like the tooth of remorse.\nCuriously enough, his pain in the affair beforehand had consisted\nalmost entirely in the sense that he must seem dishonorable, and sink\nin the opinion of the Garths: he had not occupied himself with the\ninconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion them,\nfor this exercise of the imagination on other people’s needs is not\ncommon with hopeful young gentlemen. Indeed we are most of us brought\nup in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is\nsomething irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong. But at\nthis moment he suddenly saw himself as a pitiful rascal who was robbing\ntwo women of their savings.“I shall certainly pay it all, Mrs. Garth—ultimately,” he stammered\nout.“Yes, ultimately,” said Mrs. Garth, who having a special dislike to\nfine words on ugly occasions, could not now repress an epigram. “But\nboys cannot well be apprenticed ultimately: they should be apprenticed\nat fifteen.” She had never been so little inclined to make excuses for\nFred.“I was the most in the wrong, Susan,” said Caleb. “Fred made sure of\nfinding the money. But I’d no business to be fingering bills. I suppose\nyou have looked all round and tried all honest means?” he added, fixing\nhis merciful gray eyes on Fred. Caleb was too delicate to specify Mr.\nFeatherstone."

My uncle had given me eighty pounds, and I paid\naway thirty with my old horse in order to get another which I was going\nto sell for eighty or more—I meant to go without a horse—but now it has\nturned out vicious and lamed itself. I wish I and the horses too had\nbeen at the devil, before I had brought this on you. There’s no one\nelse I care so much for: you and Mrs. Garth have always been so kind to\nme. However, it’s no use saying that. You will always think me a rascal\nnow.”Fred turned round and hurried out of the room, conscious that he was\ngetting rather womanish, and feeling confusedly that his being sorry\nwas not of much use to the Garths. They could see him mount, and\nquickly pass through the gate.“I am disappointed in Fred Vincy,” said Mrs. Garth. “I would not have\nbelieved beforehand that he would have drawn you into his debts. I knew\nhe was extravagant, but I did not think that he would be so mean as to\nhang his risks on his oldest friend, who could the least afford to\nlose.”“I was a fool, Susan.”“That you were,” said the wife, nodding and smiling. “But I should not\nhave gone to publish it in the market-place. Why should you keep such\nthings from me? It is just so with your buttons: you let them burst off\nwithout telling me, and go out with your wristband hanging. If I had\nonly known I might have been ready with some better plan.”“You are sadly cut up, I know, Susan,” said Caleb, looking feelingly at\nher. “I can’t abide your losing the money you’ve scraped together for\nAlfred.”“It is very well that I _had_ scraped it together; and it is you who\nwill have to suffer, for you must teach the boy yourself. You must give\nup your bad habits. Some men take to drinking, and you have taken to\nworking without pay. You must indulge yourself a little less in that.\nAnd you must ride over to Mary, and ask the child what money she has.”Caleb had pushed his chair back, and was leaning forward, shaking his\nhead slowly, and fitting his finger-tips together with much nicety.“Poor Mary!” he said. “Susan,” he went on in a lowered tone, “I’m\nafraid she may be fond of Fred.”“Oh no! She always laughs at him; and he is not likely to think of her\nin any other than a brotherly way.”Caleb made no rejoinder, but presently lowered his spectacles, drew up\nhis chair to the desk, and said, “Deuce take the bill—I wish it was at\nHanover! These things are a sad interruption to business!”"

  "content": "The first part of this speech comprised his whole store of maledictory\nexpression, and was uttered with a slight snarl easy to imagine. But it\nwould be difficult to convey to those who never heard him utter the\nword “business,” the peculiar tone of fervid veneration, of religious\nregard, in which he wrapped it, as a consecrated symbol is wrapped in\nits gold-fringed linen.Caleb Garth often shook his head in meditation on the value, the\nindispensable might of that myriad-headed, myriad-handed labor by which\nthe social body is fed, clothed, and housed. It had laid hold of his\nimagination in boyhood. The echoes of the great hammer where roof or\nkeel were a-making, the signal-shouts of the workmen, the roar of the\nfurnace, the thunder and plash of the engine, were a sublime music to\nhim; the felling and lading of timber, and the huge trunk vibrating\nstar-like in the distance along the highway, the crane at work on the\nwharf, the piled-up produce in warehouses, the precision and variety of\nmuscular effort wherever exact work had to be turned out,—all these\nsights of his youth had acted on him as poetry without the aid of the\npoets, had made a philosophy for him without the aid of philosophers, a\nreligion without the aid of theology. His early ambition had been to\nhave as effective a share as possible in this sublime labor, which was\npeculiarly dignified by him with the name of “business;” and though he\nhad only been a short time under a surveyor, and had been chiefly his\nown teacher, he knew more of land, building, and mining than most of\nthe special men in the county."

  "content": "His classification of human employments was rather crude, and, like the\ncategories of more celebrated men, would not be acceptable in these\nadvanced times. He divided them into “business, politics, preaching,\nlearning, and amusement.” He had nothing to say against the last four;\nbut he regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than\nhis own. In the same way, he thought very well of all ranks, but he\nwould not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he had not such\nclose contact with “business” as to get often honorably decorated with\nmarks of dust and mortar, the damp of the engine, or the sweet soil of\nthe woods and fields. Though he had never regarded himself as other\nthan an orthodox Christian, and would argue on prevenient grace if the\nsubject were proposed to him, I think his virtual divinities were good\npractical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of\nundertakings: his prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there was\nno spirit of denial in Caleb, and the world seemed so wondrous to him\nthat he was ready to accept any number of systems, like any number of\nfirmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best\nland-drainage, solid building, correct measuring, and judicious boring\n(for coal). In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong practical\nintelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but\nhe had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of\nprofit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined\nto give up all forms of his beloved “business” which required that\ntalent. He gave himself up entirely to the many kinds of work which he\ncould do without handling capital, and was one of those precious men\nwithin his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them,\nbecause he did his work well, charged very little, and often declined\nto charge at all. It is no wonder, then, that the Garths were poor, and\n“lived in a small way.” However, they did not mind it."

BLAKE: _Songs of Experience_.Fred Vincy wanted to arrive at Stone Court when Mary could not expect\nhim, and when his uncle was not downstairs: in that case she might be\nsitting alone in the wainscoted parlor. He left his horse in the yard\nto avoid making a noise on the gravel in front, and entered the parlor\nwithout other notice than the noise of the door-handle. Mary was in her\nusual corner, laughing over Mrs. Piozzi’s recollections of Johnson, and\nlooked up with the fun still in her face. It gradually faded as she saw\nFred approach her without speaking, and stand before her with his elbow\non the mantel-piece, looking ill. She too was silent, only raising her\neyes to him inquiringly.“Mary,” he began, “I am a good-for-nothing blackguard.”“I should think one of those epithets would do at a time,” said Mary,\ntrying to smile, but feeling alarmed.“I know you will never think well of me any more. You will think me a\nliar. You will think me dishonest. You will think I didn’t care for\nyou, or your father and mother. You always do make the worst of me, I\nknow.”“I cannot deny that I shall think all that of you, Fred, if you give me\ngood reasons. But please to tell me at once what you have done.

And I can’t ask my father for the money: he would not\ngive me a farthing. And my uncle gave me a hundred a little while ago.\nSo what can I do? And now your father has no ready money to spare, and\nyour mother will have to pay away her ninety-two pounds that she has\nsaved, and she says your savings must go too. You see what a—”“Oh, poor mother, poor father!” said Mary, her eyes filling with tears,\nand a little sob rising which she tried to repress. She looked straight\nbefore her and took no notice of Fred, all the consequences at home\nbecoming present to her. He too remained silent for some moments,\nfeeling more miserable than ever. “I wouldn’t have hurt you for the\nworld, Mary,” he said at last. “You can never forgive me.”“What does it matter whether I forgive you?” said Mary, passionately.\n“Would that make it any better for my mother to lose the money she has\nbeen earning by lessons for four years, that she might send Alfred to\nMr. Hanmer’s? Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave\nyou?”“Say what you like, Mary. I deserve it all.”“I don’t want to say anything,” said Mary, more quietly, “and my anger\nis of no use.” She dried her eyes, threw aside her book, rose and\nfetched her sewing.Fred followed her with his eyes, hoping that they would meet hers, and\nin that way find access for his imploring penitence. But no! Mary could\neasily avoid looking upward.“I do care about your mother’s money going,” he said, when she was\nseated again and sewing quickly. “I wanted to ask you, Mary—don’t you\nthink that Mr. Featherstone—if you were to tell him—tell him, I mean,\nabout apprenticing Alfred—would advance the money?”“My family is not fond of begging, Fred. We would rather work for our\nmoney. Besides, you say that Mr. Featherstone has lately given you a\nhundred pounds. He rarely makes presents; he has never made presents to\nus. I am sure my father will not ask him for anything; and even if I\nchose to beg of him, it would be of no use.”“I am so miserable, Mary—if you knew how miserable I am, you would be\nsorry for me.”“There are other things to be more sorry for than that.

There is not a better man in the world than your father,\nand yet he got into trouble.”“How dare you make any comparison between my father and you, Fred?”\nsaid Mary, in a deep tone of indignation. “He never got into trouble by\nthinking of his own idle pleasures, but because he was always thinking\nof the work he was doing for other people. And he has fared hard, and\nworked hard to make good everybody’s loss.”“And you think that I shall never try to make good anything, Mary. It\nis not generous to believe the worst of a man.

There is often\nsomething maternal even in a girlish love, and Mary’s hard experience\nhad wrought her nature to an impressibility very different from that\nhard slight thing which we call girlishness. At Fred’s last words she\nfelt an instantaneous pang, something like what a mother feels at the\nimagined sobs or cries of her naughty truant child, which may lose\nitself and get harm.

Of course Fred felt as if the clouds had parted and a\ngleam had come: he moved and stood in her way.“Say one word, Mary, and I will do anything. Say you will not think the\nworst of me—will not give me up altogether.”“As if it were any pleasure to me to think ill of you,” said Mary, in a\nmournful tone. “As if it were not very painful to me to see you an idle\nfrivolous creature. How can you bear to be so contemptible, when others\nare working and striving, and there are so many things to be done—how\ncan you bear to be fit for nothing in the world that is useful? And\nwith so much good in your disposition, Fred,—you might be worth a great\ndeal.”“I will try to be anything you like, Mary, if you will say that you\nlove me.”“I should be ashamed to say that I loved a man who must always be\nhanging on others, and reckoning on what they would do for him.

To him it was\nlike the cessation of an ache that Mary could laugh at him, and with a\npassive sort of smile he tried to reach her hand; but she slipped away\nquickly towards the door and said, “I shall tell uncle.

He never dared in\nMary’s presence to approach the subject of his expectations from Mr.\nFeatherstone, and she always ignored them, as if everything depended on\nhimself. But if ever he actually came into the property, she must\nrecognize the change in his position. All this passed through his mind\nsomewhat languidly, before he went up to see his uncle. He stayed but a\nlittle while, excusing himself on the ground that he had a cold; and\nMary did not reappear before he left the house. But as he rode home, he\nbegan to be more conscious of being ill, than of being melancholy.When Caleb Garth arrived at Stone Court soon after dusk, Mary was not\nsurprised, although he seldom had leisure for paying her a visit, and\nwas not at all fond of having to talk with Mr. Featherstone. The old\nman, on the other hand, felt himself ill at ease with a brother-in-law\nwhom he could not annoy, who did not mind about being considered poor,\nhad nothing to ask of him, and understood all kinds of farming and\nmining business better than he did. But Mary had felt sure that her\nparents would want to see her, and if her father had not come, she\nwould have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day.\nAfter discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone, Caleb rose to\nbid him good-by, and said, “I want to speak to you, Mary.”She took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no fire,\nand setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table, turned\nround to her father, and putting her arms round his neck kissed him\nwith childish kisses which he delighted in,—the expression of his large\nbrows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog softens when\nit is caressed. Mary was his favorite child, and whatever Susan might\nsay, and right as she was on all other subjects, Caleb thought it\nnatural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more lovable than\nother girls.“I’ve got something to tell you, my dear,” said Caleb in his hesitating\nway. “No very good news; but then it might be worse.”“About money, father? I think I know what it is.”“Ay? how can that be? You see, I’ve been a bit of a fool again, and put\nmy name to a bill, and now it comes to paying; and your mother has got\nto part with her savings, that’s the worst of it, and even they won’t\nquite make things even.

See! beautiful white notes and\ngold.”Mary took out the folded money from her reticule and put it into her\nfather’s hand.“Well, but how—we only want eighteen—here, put the rest back,\nchild,—but how did you know about it?” said Caleb, who, in his\nunconquerable indifference to money, was beginning to be chiefly\nconcerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary’s\naffections.“Fred told me this morning.”“Ah! Did he come on purpose?”“Yes, I think so. He was a good deal distressed.”“I’m afraid Fred is not to be trusted, Mary,” said the father, with\nhesitating tenderness. “He means better than he acts, perhaps. But I\nshould think it a pity for any body’s happiness to be wrapped up in\nhim, and so would your mother.”“And so should I, father,” said Mary, not looking up, but putting the\nback of her father’s hand against her cheek.“I don’t want to pry, my dear. But I was afraid there might be\nsomething between you and Fred, and I wanted to caution you. You see,\nMary”—here Caleb’s voice became more tender; he had been pushing his\nhat about on the table and looking at it, but finally he turned his\neyes on his daughter—“a woman, let her be as good as she may, has got\nto put up with the life her husband makes for her. Your mother has had\nto put up with a good deal because of me.”Mary turned the back of her father’s hand to her lips and smiled at\nhim."

That’s the long and the\nshort of it, Mary. Young folks may get fond of each other before they\nknow what life is, and they may think it all holiday if they can only\nget together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear. However, you\nhave more sense than most, and you haven’t been kept in cotton-wool:\nthere may be no occasion for me to say this, but a father trembles for\nhis daughter, and you are all by yourself here.”“Don’t fear for me, father,” said Mary, gravely meeting her father’s\neyes; “Fred has always been very good to me; he is kind-hearted and\naffectionate, and not false, I think, with all his self-indulgence. But\nI will never engage myself to one who has no manly independence, and\nwho goes on loitering away his time on the chance that others will\nprovide for him. You and my mother have taught me too much pride for\nthat.”“That’s right—that’s right. Then I am easy,” said Mr. Garth, taking up\nhis hat. “But it’s hard to run away with your earnings, eh child.”“Father!” said Mary, in her deepest tone of remonstrance. “Take\npocketfuls of love besides to them all at home,” was her last word\nbefore he closed the outer door on himself.“I suppose your father wanted your earnings,” said old Mr.\nFeatherstone, with his usual power of unpleasant surmise, when Mary\nreturned to him. “He makes but a tight fit, I reckon. You’re of age\nnow; you ought to be saving for yourself.”“I consider my father and mother the best part of myself, sir,” said\nMary, coldly.Mr. Featherstone grunted: he could not deny that an ordinary sort of\ngirl like her might be expected to be useful, so he thought of another\nrejoinder, disagreeable enough to be always apropos. “If Fred Vincy\ncomes to-morrow, now, don’t you keep him chattering: let him come up to\nme.”CHAPTER XXVI.He beats me and I rail at him: O worthy satisfaction! would it were\notherwise—that I could beat him while he railed at me.—_Troilus and\nCressida_."

  "content": "But Fred did not go to Stone Court the next day, for reasons that were\nquite peremptory. From those visits to unsanitary Houndsley streets in\nsearch of Diamond, he had brought back not only a bad bargain in\nhorse-flesh, but the further misfortune of some ailment which for a day\nor two had deemed mere depression and headache, but which got so much\nworse when he returned from his visit to Stone Court that, going into\nthe dining-room, he threw himself on the sofa, and in answer to his\nmother’s anxious question, said, “I feel very ill: I think you must\nsend for Wrench.”Wrench came, but did not apprehend anything serious, spoke of a “slight\nderangement,” and did not speak of coming again on the morrow. He had a\ndue value for the Vincys’ house, but the wariest men are apt to be\ndulled by routine, and on worried mornings will sometimes go through\ntheir business with the zest of the daily bell-ringer. Mr. Wrench was a\nsmall, neat, bilious man, with a well-dressed wig: he had a laborious\npractice, an irascible temper, a lymphatic wife and seven children; and\nhe was already rather late before setting out on a four-miles drive to\nmeet Dr. Minchin on the other side of Tipton, the decease of Hicks, a\nrural practitioner, having increased Middlemarch practice in that\ndirection. Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men? Mr.\nWrench did not neglect sending the usual white parcels, which this time\nhad black and drastic contents. Their effect was not alleviating to\npoor Fred, who, however, unwilling as he said to believe that he was\n“in for an illness,” rose at his usual easy hour the next morning and\nwent down-stairs meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but in\nsitting and shivering by the fire. Mr. Wrench was again sent for, but\nwas gone on his rounds, and Mrs. Vincy seeing her darling’s changed\nlooks and general misery, began to cry and said she would send for Dr.\nSprague.“Oh, nonsense, mother! It’s nothing,” said Fred, putting out his hot\ndry hand to her, “I shall soon be all right. I must have taken cold in\nthat nasty damp ride.”“Mamma!” said Rosamond, who was seated near the window (the dining-room\nwindows looked on that highly respectable street called Lowick Gate),\n“there is Mr. Lydgate, stopping to speak to some one. If I were you I\nwould call him in. He has cured Ellen Bulstrode. They say he cures\nevery one.”"

Lydgate was only two yards\noff on the other side of some iron palisading, and turned round at the\nsudden sound of the sash, before she called to him. In two minutes he\nwas in the room, and Rosamond went out, after waiting just long enough\nto show a pretty anxiety conflicting with her sense of what was\nbecoming.Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy’s mind insisted\nwith remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance, especially\non what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again. That\nthere might be an awkward affair with Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but\nthe case was serious enough to make him dismiss that consideration: he\nwas convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever,\nand that he had taken just the wrong medicines. He must go to bed\nimmediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and\nprecautions must be used, about which Lydgate was particular. Poor Mrs.\nVincy’s terror at these indications of danger found vent in such words\nas came most easily. She thought it “very ill usage on the part of Mr.\nWrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference to Mr.\nPeacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr. Wrench should\nneglect her children more than others, she could not for the life of\nher understand. He had not neglected Mrs. Larcher’s when they had the\nmeasles, nor indeed would Mrs. Vincy have wished that he should. And if\nanything should happen—”Here poor Mrs. Vincy’s spirit quite broke down, and her Niobe throat\nand good-humored face were sadly convulsed. This was in the hall out of\nFred’s hearing, but Rosamond had opened the drawing-room door, and now\ncame forward anxiously. Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench, said that\nthe symptoms yesterday might have been disguising, and that this form\nof fever was very equivocal in its beginnings: he would go immediately\nto the druggist’s and have a prescription made up in order to lose no\ntime, but he would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him what had been done.“But you must come again—you must go on attending Fred. I can’t have my\nboy left to anybody who may come or not. I bear nobody ill-will, thank\nGod, and Mr. Wrench saved me in the pleurisy, but he’d better have let\nme die—if—if—”"

  "content": "“I will meet Mr. Wrench here, then, shall I?” said Lydgate, really\nbelieving that Wrench was not well prepared to deal wisely with a case\nof this kind.“Pray make that arrangement, Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, coming to her\nmother’s aid, and supporting her arm to lead her away.When Mr. Vincy came home he was very angry with Wrench, and did not\ncare if he never came into his house again. Lydgate should go on now,\nwhether Wrench liked it or not. It was no joke to have fever in the\nhouse. Everybody must be sent to now, not to come to dinner on\nThursday. And Pritchard needn’t get up any wine: brandy was the best\nthing against infection. “I shall drink brandy,” added Mr. Vincy,\nemphatically—as much as to say, this was not an occasion for firing\nwith blank-cartridges. “He’s an uncommonly unfortunate lad, is Fred.\nHe’d need have some luck by and by to make up for all this—else I don’t\nknow who’d have an eldest son.”“Don’t say so, Vincy,” said the mother, with a quivering lip, “if you\ndon’t want him to be taken from me.”“It will worret you to death, Lucy; _that_ I can see,” said Mr. Vincy,\nmore mildly. “However, Wrench shall know what I think of the matter.”\n(What Mr. Vincy thought confusedly was, that the fever might somehow\nhave been hindered if Wrench had shown the proper solicitude about\nhis—the Mayor’s—family.) “I’m the last man to give in to the cry about\nnew doctors, or new parsons either—whether they’re Bulstrode’s men or\nnot. But Wrench shall know what I think, take it as he will.”Wrench did not take it at all well. Lydgate was as polite as he could\nbe in his offhand way, but politeness in a man who has placed you at a\ndisadvantage is only an additional exasperation, especially if he\nhappens to have been an object of dislike beforehand. Country\npractitioners used to be an irritable species, susceptible on the point\nof honor; and Mr. Wrench was one of the most irritable among them. He\ndid not refuse to meet Lydgate in the evening, but his temper was\nsomewhat tried on the occasion. He had to hear Mrs. Vincy say—"

  "content": "“Oh, Mr. Wrench, what have I ever done that you should use me so?— To\ngo away, and never to come again! And my boy might have been stretched\na corpse!”Mr. Vincy, who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy Infection,\nand was a good deal heated in consequence, started up when he heard\nWrench come in, and went into the hall to let him know what he thought.“I’ll tell you what, Wrench, this is beyond a joke,” said the Mayor,\nwho of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official air, and now\nbroadened himself by putting his thumbs in his armholes. “To let fever\nget unawares into a house like this. There are some things that ought\nto be actionable, and are not so— that’s my opinion.”But irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of being\ninstructed, or rather the sense that a younger man, like Lydgate,\ninwardly considered him in need of instruction, for “in point of fact,”\nMr. Wrench afterwards said, Lydgate paraded flighty, foreign notions,\nwhich would not wear. He swallowed his ire for the moment, but he\nafterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case. The house\nmight be a good one, but Mr. Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody\non a professional matter. He reflected, with much probability on his\nside, that Lydgate would by-and-by be caught tripping too, and that his\nungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by his\nprofessional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on himself. He threw out\nbiting remarks on Lydgate’s tricks, worthy only of a quack, to get\nhimself a factitious reputation with credulous people. That cant about\ncures was never got up by sound practitioners.This was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Wrench could\ndesire. To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating, but\nperilous, and not more enviable than the reputation of the\nweather-prophet. He was impatient of the foolish expectations amidst\nwhich all work must be carried on, and likely enough to damage himself\nas much as Mr. Wrench could wish, by an unprofessional openness."

Some\nsaid, that the Vincys had behaved scandalously, that Mr. Vincy had\nthreatened Wrench, and that Mrs. Vincy had accused him of poisoning her\nson. Others were of opinion that Mr. Lydgate’s passing by was\nprovidential, that he was wonderfully clever in fevers, and that\nBulstrode was in the right to bring him forward. Many people believed\nthat Lydgate’s coming to the town at all was really due to Bulstrode;\nand Mrs. Taft, who was always counting stitches and gathered her\ninformation in misleading fragments caught between the rows of her\nknitting, had got it into her head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son\nof Bulstrode’s, a fact which seemed to justify her suspicions of\nevangelical laymen.She one day communicated this piece of knowledge to Mrs. Farebrother,\nwho did not fail to tell her son of it, observing—“I should not be surprised at anything in Bulstrode, but I should be\nsorry to think it of Mr. Lydgate.”“Why, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother, after an explosive laugh, “you\nknow very well that Lydgate is of a good family in the North. He never\nheard of Bulstrode before he came here.”“That is satisfactory so far as Mr. Lydgate is concerned, Camden,” said\nthe old lady, with an air of precision.—“But as to Bulstrode—the report\nmay be true of some other son.”CHAPTER XXVII.Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian:\nWe are but mortals, and must sing of man."

  "content": "An eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify even your ugly\nfurniture by lifting it into the serene light of science, has shown me\nthis pregnant little fact. Your pier-glass or extensive surface of\npolished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and\nmultitudinously scratched in all directions; but place now against it a\nlighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo! the scratches will\nseem to arrange themselves in a fine series of concentric circles round\nthat little sun. It is demonstrable that the scratches are going\neverywhere impartially and it is only your candle which produces the\nflattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light falling with\nan exclusive optical selection. These things are a parable. The\nscratches are events, and the candle is the egoism of any person now\nabsent—of Miss Vincy, for example. Rosamond had a Providence of her own\nwho had kindly made her more charming than other girls, and who seemed\nto have arranged Fred’s illness and Mr. Wrench’s mistake in order to\nbring her and Lydgate within effective proximity. It would have been to\ncontravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to go away to\nStone Court or elsewhere, as her parents wished her to do, especially\nsince Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless. Therefore, while\nMiss Morgan and the children were sent away to a farmhouse the morning\nafter Fred’s illness had declared itself, Rosamond refused to leave\npapa and mamma.Poor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman;\nand Mr. Vincy, who doted on his wife, was more alarmed on her account\nthan on Fred’s. But for his insistence she would have taken no rest:\nher brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her costume which had\nalways been so fresh and gay, she was like a sick bird with languid eye\nand plumage ruffled, her senses dulled to the sights and sounds that\nused most to interest her. Fred’s delirium, in which he seemed to be\nwandering out of her reach, tore her heart. After her first outburst\nagainst Mr. Wrench she went about very quietly: her one low cry was to\nLydgate. She would follow him out of the room and put her hand on his\narm moaning out, “Save my boy.” Once she pleaded, “He has always been\ngood to me, Mr. Lydgate: he never had a hard word for his mother,”—as\nif poor Fred’s suffering were an accusation against him. All the\ndeepest fibres of the mother’s memory were stirred, and the young man\nwhose voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her, was one with the\nbabe whom she had loved, with a love new to her, before he was born."

  "content": "“I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy,” Lydgate would say. “Come down with me\nand let us talk about the food.” In that way he led her to the parlor\nwhere Rosamond was, and made a change for her, surprising her into\ntaking some tea or broth which had been prepared for her. There was a\nconstant understanding between him and Rosamond on these matters. He\nalmost always saw her before going to the sickroom, and she appealed to\nhim as to what she could do for mamma. Her presence of mind and\nadroitness in carrying out his hints were admirable, and it is not\nwonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with\nhis interest in the case. Especially when the critical stage was\npassed, and he began to feel confident of Fred’s recovery. In the more\ndoubtful time, he had advised calling in Dr. Sprague (who, if he could,\nwould rather have remained neutral on Wrench’s account); but after two\nconsultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and there\nwas every reason to make him assiduous. Morning and evening he was at\nMr. Vincy’s, and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became\nsimply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but\nconscious of it, so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if, after all, the illness\nhad made a festival for her tenderness.Both father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits, when\nold Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that Fred must\nmake haste and get well, as he, Peter Featherstone, could not do\nwithout him, and missed his visits sadly. The old man himself was\ngetting bedridden. Mrs. Vincy told these messages to Fred when he could\nlisten, and he turned towards her his delicate, pinched face, from\nwhich all the thick blond hair had been cut away, and in which the eyes\nseemed to have got larger, yearning for some word about Mary—wondering\nwhat she felt about his illness. No word passed his lips; but “to hear\nwith eyes belongs to love’s rare wit,” and the mother in the fulness of\nher heart not only divined Fred’s longing, but felt ready for any\nsacrifice in order to satisfy him.“If I can only see my boy strong again,” she said, in her loving folly;\n“and who knows?—perhaps master of Stone Court! and he can marry anybody\nhe likes then.”“Not if they won’t have me, mother,” said Fred. The illness had made\nhim childish, and tears came as he spoke.“Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, secretly\nincredulous of any such refusal."
