Mr. Thesiger is turned against him, and wants him\nout o’ the parish. And there’s gentlemen in this town says they’d as\nsoon dine with a fellow from the hulks. ‘And a deal sooner I would,’\nsays Fletcher; ‘for what’s more against one’s stomach than a man coming\nand making himself bad company with his religion, and giving out as the\nTen Commandments are not enough for him, and all the while he’s worse\nthan half the men at the tread-mill?’ Fletcher said so himself.”“It’ll be a bad thing for the town though, if Bulstrode’s money goes\nout of it,” said Mr. Limp, quaveringly.“Ah, there’s better folks spend their money worse,” said a firm-voiced\ndyer, whose crimson hands looked out of keeping with his good-natured\nface.“But he won’t keep his money, by what I can make out,” said the\nglazier. “Don’t they say as there’s somebody can strip it off him? By\nwhat I can understan’, they could take every penny off him, if they\nwent to lawing.”“No such thing!” said the barber, who felt himself a little above his\ncompany at Dollop’s, but liked it none the worse. “Fletcher says it’s\nno such thing. He says they might prove over and over again whose child\nthis young Ladislaw was, and they’d do no more than if they proved I\ncame out of the Fens—he couldn’t touch a penny.”"

Then by that, it’s o’ no use who your father and mother is.\nBut as to listening to what one lawyer says without asking another—I\nwonder at a man o’ your cleverness, Mr. Dill. It’s well known there’s\nalways two sides, if no more; else who’d go to law, I should like to\nknow? It’s a poor tale, with all the law as there is up and down, if\nit’s no use proving whose child you are. Fletcher may say that if he\nlikes, but I say, don’t Fletcher _me_!”Mr. Dill affected to laugh in a complimentary way at Mrs. Dollop, as a\nwoman who was more than a match for the lawyers; being disposed to\nsubmit to much twitting from a landlady who had a long score against\nhim.“If they come to lawing, and it’s all true as folks say, there’s more\nto be looked to nor money,” said the glazier. “There’s this poor\ncreetur as is dead and gone; by what I can make out, he’d seen the day\nwhen he was a deal finer gentleman nor Bulstrode.”“Finer gentleman! I’ll warrant him,” said Mrs. Dollop; “and a far\npersonabler man, by what I can hear. As I said when Mr. Baldwin, the\ntax-gatherer, comes in, a-standing where you sit, and says, ‘Bulstrode\ngot all his money as he brought into this town by thieving and\nswindling,’—I said, ‘You don’t make me no wiser, Mr. Baldwin: it’s set\nmy blood a-creeping to look at him ever sin’ here he came into\nSlaughter Lane a-wanting to buy the house over my head: folks don’t\nlook the color o’ the dough-tub and stare at you as if they wanted to\nsee into your backbone for nothingk.’ That was what I said, and Mr.\nBaldwin can bear me witness.”“And in the rights of it too,” said Mr. Crabbe. “For by what I can make\nout, this Raffles, as they call him, was a lusty, fresh-colored man as\nyou’d wish to see, and the best o’ company—though dead he lies in\nLowick churchyard sure enough; and by what I can understan’, there’s\nthem knows more than they _should_ know about how he got there.”"

There was a chorus of adhesion from the more\ncourageous; but Mr. Limp, after taking a draught, placed his flat hands\ntogether and pressed them hard between his knees, looking down at them\nwith blear-eyed contemplation, as if the scorching power of Mrs.\nDollop’s speech had quite dried up and nullified his wits until they\ncould be brought round again by further moisture.“Why shouldn’t they dig the man up and have the Crowner?” said the\ndyer. “It’s been done many and many’s the time. If there’s been foul\nplay they might find it out.”“Not they, Mr. Jonas!” said Mrs Dollop, emphatically. “I know what\ndoctors are. They’re a deal too cunning to be found out. And this\nDoctor Lydgate that’s been for cutting up everybody before the breath\nwas well out o’ their body—it’s plain enough what use he wanted to make\no’ looking into respectable people’s insides. He knows drugs, you may\nbe sure, as you can neither smell nor see, neither before they’re\nswallowed nor after. Why, I’ve seen drops myself ordered by Doctor\nGambit, as is our club doctor and a good charikter, and has brought\nmore live children into the world nor ever another i’ Middlemarch—I say\nI’ve seen drops myself as made no difference whether they was in the\nglass or out, and yet have griped you the next day. So I’ll leave your\nown sense to judge. Don’t tell me! All I say is, it’s a mercy they\ndidn’t take this Doctor Lydgate on to our club. There’s many a mother’s\nchild might ha’ rued it.”"

  "content": "The heads of this discussion at “Dollop’s” had been the common theme\namong all classes in the town, had been carried to Lowick Parsonage on\none side and to Tipton Grange on the other, had come fully to the ears\nof the Vincy family, and had been discussed with sad reference to “poor\nHarriet” by all Mrs. Bulstrode’s friends, before Lydgate knew\ndistinctly why people were looking strangely at him, and before\nBulstrode himself suspected the betrayal of his secrets. He had not\nbeen accustomed to very cordial relations with his neighbors, and hence\nhe could not miss the signs of cordiality; moreover, he had been taking\njourneys on business of various kinds, having now made up his mind that\nhe need not quit Middlemarch, and feeling able consequently to\ndetermine on matters which he had before left in suspense.“We will make a journey to Cheltenham in the course of a month or two,”\nhe had said to his wife. “There are great spiritual advantages to be\nhad in that town along with the air and the waters, and six weeks there\nwill be eminently refreshing to us.”He really believed in the spiritual advantages, and meant that his life\nhenceforth should be the more devoted because of those later sins which\nhe represented to himself as hypothetic, praying hypothetically for\ntheir pardon:—“if I have herein transgressed.”As to the Hospital, he avoided saying anything further to Lydgate,\nfearing to manifest a too sudden change of plans immediately on the\ndeath of Raffles. In his secret soul he believed that Lydgate suspected\nhis orders to have been intentionally disobeyed, and suspecting this he\nmust also suspect a motive. But nothing had been betrayed to him as to\nthe history of Raffles, and Bulstrode was anxious not to do anything\nwhich would give emphasis to his undefined suspicions. As to any\ncertainty that a particular method of treatment would either save or\nkill, Lydgate himself was constantly arguing against such dogmatism; he\nhad no right to speak, and he had every motive for being silent. Hence\nBulstrode felt himself providentially secured. The only incident he had\nstrongly winced under had been an occasional encounter with Caleb\nGarth, who, however, had raised his hat with mild gravity.Meanwhile, on the part of the principal townsmen a strong determination\nwas growing against him."

  "content": "A meeting was to be held in the Town-Hall on a sanitary question which\nhad risen into pressing importance by the occurrence of a cholera case\nin the town. Since the Act of Parliament, which had been hurriedly\npassed, authorizing assessments for sanitary measures, there had been a\nBoard for the superintendence of such measures appointed in\nMiddlemarch, and much cleansing and preparation had been concurred in\nby Whigs and Tories. The question now was, whether a piece of ground\noutside the town should be secured as a burial-ground by means of\nassessment or by private subscription. The meeting was to be open, and\nalmost everybody of importance in the town was expected to be there.Mr. Bulstrode was a member of the Board, and just before twelve o’clock\nhe started from the Bank with the intention of urging the plan of\nprivate subscription. Under the hesitation of his projects, he had for\nsome time kept himself in the background, and he felt that he should\nthis morning resume his old position as a man of action and influence\nin the public affairs of the town where he expected to end his days.\nAmong the various persons going in the same direction, he saw Lydgate;\nthey joined, talked over the object of the meeting, and entered it\ntogether.It seemed that everybody of mark had been earlier than they. But there\nwere still spaces left near the head of the large central table, and\nthey made their way thither. Mr. Farebrother sat opposite, not far from\nMr. Hawley; all the medical men were there; Mr. Thesiger was in the\nchair, and Mr. Brooke of Tipton was on his right hand.Lydgate noticed a peculiar interchange of glances when he and Bulstrode\ntook their seats.After the business had been fully opened by the chairman, who pointed\nout the advantages of purchasing by subscription a piece of ground\nlarge enough to be ultimately used as a general cemetery, Mr.\nBulstrode, whose rather high-pitched but subdued and fluent voice the\ntown was used to at meetings of this sort, rose and asked leave to\ndeliver his opinion. Lydgate could see again the peculiar interchange\nof glances before Mr. Hawley started up, and said in his firm resonant\nvoice, “Mr. Chairman, I request that before any one delivers his\nopinion on this point I may be permitted to speak on a question of\npublic feeling, which not only by myself, but by many gentlemen\npresent, is regarded as preliminary.”Mr. Hawley’s mode of speech, even when public decorum repressed his\n“awful language,” was formidable in its curtness and self-possession.\nMr. Thesiger sanctioned the request, Mr. Bulstrode sat down, and Mr.\nHawley continued."

  "content": "“In what I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I am not speaking simply on my\nown behalf: I am speaking with the concurrence and at the express\nrequest of no fewer than eight of my fellow-townsmen, who are\nimmediately around us. It is our united sentiment that Mr. Bulstrode\nshould be called upon—and I do now call upon him—to resign public\npositions which he holds not simply as a tax-payer, but as a gentleman\namong gentlemen. There are practices and there are acts which, owing to\ncircumstances, the law cannot visit, though they may be worse than many\nthings which are legally punishable. Honest men and gentlemen, if they\ndon’t want the company of people who perpetrate such acts, have got to\ndefend themselves as they best can, and that is what I and the friends\nwhom I may call my clients in this affair are determined to do. I don’t\nsay that Mr. Bulstrode has been guilty of shameful acts, but I call\nupon him either publicly to deny and confute the scandalous statements\nmade against him by a man now dead, and who died in his house—the\nstatement that he was for many years engaged in nefarious practices,\nand that he won his fortune by dishonest procedures—or else to withdraw\nfrom positions which could only have been allowed him as a gentleman\namong gentlemen.”All eyes in the room were turned on Mr. Bulstrode, who, since the first\nmention of his name, had been going through a crisis of feeling almost\ntoo violent for his delicate frame to support. Lydgate, who himself was\nundergoing a shock as from the terrible practical interpretation of\nsome faint augury, felt, nevertheless, that his own movement of\nresentful hatred was checked by that instinct of the Healer which\nthinks first of bringing rescue or relief to the sufferer, when he\nlooked at the shrunken misery of Bulstrode’s livid face.The quick vision that his life was after all a failure, that he was a\ndishonored man, and must quail before the glance of those towards whom\nhe had habitually assumed the attitude of a reprover—that God had\ndisowned him before men and left him unscreened to the triumphant scorn\nof those who were glad to have their hatred justified—the sense of\nutter futility in that equivocation with his conscience in dealing with\nthe life of his accomplice, an equivocation which now turned venomously\nupon him with the full-grown fang of a discovered lie:—all this rushed\nthrough him like the agony of terror which fails to kill, and leaves\nthe ears still open to the returning wave of execration. The sudden\nsense of exposure after the re-established sense of safety came—not to\nthe coarse organization of a criminal, but to the susceptible nerve of\na man whose intensest being lay in such mastery and predominance as the\nconditions of his life had shaped for him."

  "content": "But in that intense being lay the strength of reaction. Through all his\nbodily infirmity there ran a tenacious nerve of ambitious\nself-preserving will, which had continually leaped out like a flame,\nscattering all doctrinal fears, and which, even while he sat an object\nof compassion for the merciful, was beginning to stir and glow under\nhis ashy paleness. Before the last words were out of Mr. Hawley’s\nmouth, Bulstrode felt that he should answer, and that his answer would\nbe a retort. He dared not get up and say, “I am not guilty, the whole\nstory is false”—even if he had dared this, it would have seemed to him,\nunder his present keen sense of betrayal, as vain as to pull, for\ncovering to his nakedness, a frail rag which would rend at every little\nstrain.For a few moments there was total silence, while every man in the room\nwas looking at Bulstrode. He sat perfectly still, leaning hard against\nthe back of his chair; he could not venture to rise, and when he began\nto speak he pressed his hands upon the seat on each side of him. But\nhis voice was perfectly audible, though hoarser than usual, and his\nwords were distinctly pronounced, though he paused between sentence as\nif short of breath. He said, turning first toward Mr. Thesiger, and\nthen looking at Mr. Hawley—“I protest before you, sir, as a Christian minister, against the\nsanction of proceedings towards me which are dictated by virulent\nhatred. Those who are hostile to me are glad to believe any libel\nuttered by a loose tongue against me. And their consciences become\nstrict against me. Say that the evil-speaking of which I am to be made\nthe victim accuses me of malpractices—” here Bulstrode’s voice rose and\ntook on a more biting accent, till it seemed a low cry—“who shall be my\naccuser? Not men whose own lives are unchristian, nay, scandalous—not\nmen who themselves use low instruments to carry out their ends—whose\nprofession is a tissue of chicanery—who have been spending their income\non their own sensual enjoyments, while I have been devoting mine to\nadvance the best objects with regard to this life and the next.”After the word chicanery there was a growing noise, half of murmurs and\nhalf of hisses, while four persons started up at once—Mr. Hawley, Mr.\nToller, Mr. Chichely, and Mr. Hackbutt; but Mr. Hawley’s outburst was\ninstantaneous, and left the others behind in silence."

  "content": "“If you mean me, sir, I call you and every one else to the inspection\nof my professional life. As to Christian or unchristian, I repudiate\nyour canting palavering Christianity; and as to the way in which I\nspend my income, it is not my principle to maintain thieves and cheat\noffspring of their due inheritance in order to support religion and set\nmyself up as a saintly Killjoy. I affect no niceness of conscience—I\nhave not found any nice standards necessary yet to measure your actions\nby, sir. And I again call upon you to enter into satisfactory\nexplanations concerning the scandals against you, or else to withdraw\nfrom posts in which we at any rate decline you as a colleague. I say,\nsir, we decline to co-operate with a man whose character is not cleared\nfrom infamous lights cast upon it, not only by reports but by recent\nactions.”“Allow me, Mr. Hawley,” said the chairman; and Mr. Hawley, still\nfuming, bowed half impatiently, and sat down with his hands thrust deep\nin his pockets.“Mr. Bulstrode, it is not desirable, I think, to prolong the present\ndiscussion,” said Mr. Thesiger, turning to the pallid trembling man; “I\nmust so far concur with what has fallen from Mr. Hawley in expression\nof a general feeling, as to think it due to your Christian profession\nthat you should clear yourself, if possible, from unhappy aspersions. I\nfor my part should be willing to give you full opportunity and hearing.\nBut I must say that your present attitude is painfully inconsistent\nwith those principles which you have sought to identify yourself with,\nand for the honor of which I am bound to care. I recommend you at\npresent, as your clergyman, and one who hopes for your reinstatement in\nrespect, to quit the room, and avoid further hindrance to business.”Bulstrode, after a moment’s hesitation, took his hat from the floor and\nslowly rose, but he grasped the corner of the chair so totteringly that\nLydgate felt sure there was not strength enough in him to walk away\nwithout support. What could he do? He could not see a man sink close to\nhim for want of help. He rose and gave his arm to Bulstrode, and in\nthat way led him out of the room; yet this act, which might have been\none of gentle duty and pure compassion, was at this moment unspeakably\nbitter to him. It seemed as if he were putting his sign-manual to that\nassociation of himself with Bulstrode, of which he now saw the full\nmeaning as it must have presented itself to other minds. He now felt\nthe conviction that this man who was leaning tremblingly on his arm,\nhad given him the thousand pounds as a bribe, and that somehow the\ntreatment of Raffles had been tampered with from an evil motive. The\ninferences were closely linked enough; the town knew of the loan,\nbelieved it to be a bribe, and believed that he took it as a bribe."

  "content": "Poor Lydgate, his mind struggling under the terrible clutch of this\nrevelation, was all the while morally forced to take Mr. Bulstrode to\nthe Bank, send a man off for his carriage, and wait to accompany him\nhome.Meanwhile the business of the meeting was despatched, and fringed off\ninto eager discussion among various groups concerning this affair of\nBulstrode—and Lydgate.Mr. Brooke, who had before heard only imperfect hints of it, and was\nvery uneasy that he had “gone a little too far” in countenancing\nBulstrode, now got himself fully informed, and felt some benevolent\nsadness in talking to Mr. Farebrother about the ugly light in which\nLydgate had come to be regarded. Mr. Farebrother was going to walk back\nto Lowick.“Step into my carriage,” said Mr. Brooke. “I am going round to see Mrs.\nCasaubon. She was to come back from Yorkshire last night. She will like\nto see me, you know.”So they drove along, Mr. Brooke chatting with good-natured hope that\nthere had not really been anything black in Lydgate’s behavior—a young\nfellow whom he had seen to be quite above the common mark, when he\nbrought a letter from his uncle Sir Godwin. Mr. Farebrother said\nlittle: he was deeply mournful: with a keen perception of human\nweakness, he could not be confident that under the pressure of\nhumiliating needs Lydgate had not fallen below himself.When the carriage drove up to the gate of the Manor, Dorothea was out\non the gravel, and came to greet them.“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have just come from a meeting—a\nsanitary meeting, you know.”“Was Mr. Lydgate there?” said Dorothea, who looked full of health and\nanimation, and stood with her head bare under the gleaming April\nlights. “I want to see him and have a great consultation with him about\nthe Hospital. I have engaged with Mr. Bulstrode to do so.”“Oh, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have been hearing bad news—bad\nnews, you know.”They walked through the garden towards the churchyard gate, Mr.\nFarebrother wanting to go on to the parsonage; and Dorothea heard the\nwhole sad story."

  "content": "She listened with deep interest, and begged to hear twice over the\nfacts and impressions concerning Lydgate. After a short silence,\npausing at the churchyard gate, and addressing Mr. Farebrother, she\nsaid energetically—“You don’t believe that Mr. Lydgate is guilty of anything base? I will\nnot believe it. Let us find out the truth and clear him!”BOOK VIII.\nSUNSET AND SUNRISE.CHAPTER LXXII.Full souls are double mirrors, making still\nAn endless vista of fair things before,\nRepeating things behind.Dorothea’s impetuous generosity, which would have leaped at once to the\nvindication of Lydgate from the suspicion of having accepted money as a\nbribe, underwent a melancholy check when she came to consider all the\ncircumstances of the case by the light of Mr. Farebrother’s experience.“It is a delicate matter to touch,” he said. “How can we begin to\ninquire into it? It must be either publicly by setting the magistrate\nand coroner to work, or privately by questioning Lydgate. As to the\nfirst proceeding there is no solid ground to go upon, else Hawley would\nhave adopted it; and as to opening the subject with Lydgate, I confess\nI should shrink from it. He would probably take it as a deadly insult.\nI have more than once experienced the difficulty of speaking to him on\npersonal matters. And—one should know the truth about his conduct\nbeforehand, to feel very confident of a good result.”“I feel convinced that his conduct has not been guilty: I believe that\npeople are almost always better than their neighbors think they are,”\nsaid Dorothea. Some of her intensest experience in the last two years\nhad set her mind strongly in opposition to any unfavorable construction\nof others; and for the first time she felt rather discontented with Mr.\nFarebrother. She disliked this cautious weighing of consequences,\ninstead of an ardent faith in efforts of justice and mercy, which would\nconquer by their emotional force. Two days afterwards, he was dining at\nthe Manor with her uncle and the Chettams, and when the dessert was\nstanding uneaten, the servants were out of the room, and Mr. Brooke was\nnodding in a nap, she returned to the subject with renewed vivacity."

  "content": "“Mr. Lydgate would understand that if his friends hear a calumny about\nhim their first wish must be to justify him. What do we live for, if it\nis not to make life less difficult to each other? I cannot be\nindifferent to the troubles of a man who advised me in _my_ trouble,\nand attended me in my illness.”Dorothea’s tone and manner were not more energetic than they had been\nwhen she was at the head of her uncle’s table nearly three years\nbefore, and her experience since had given her more right to express a\ndecided opinion. But Sir James Chettam was no longer the diffident and\nacquiescent suitor: he was the anxious brother-in-law, with a devout\nadmiration for his sister, but with a constant alarm lest she should\nfall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon. He\nsmiled much less; when he said “Exactly” it was more often an\nintroduction to a dissentient opinion than in those submissive bachelor\ndays; and Dorothea found to her surprise that she had to resolve not to\nbe afraid of him—all the more because he was really her best friend. He\ndisagreed with her now.“But, Dorothea,” he said, remonstrantly, “you can’t undertake to manage\na man’s life for him in that way. Lydgate must know—at least he will\nsoon come to know how he stands. If he can clear himself, he will. He\nmust act for himself.”“I think his friends must wait till they find an opportunity,” added\nMr. Farebrother. “It is possible—I have often felt so much weakness in\nmyself that I can conceive even a man of honorable disposition, such as\nI have always believed Lydgate to be, succumbing to such a temptation\nas that of accepting money which was offered more or less indirectly as\na bribe to insure his silence about scandalous facts long gone by. I\nsay, I can conceive this, if he were under the pressure of hard\ncircumstances—if he had been harassed as I feel sure Lydgate has been.\nI would not believe anything worse of him except under stringent proof.\nBut there is the terrible Nemesis following on some errors, that it is\nalways possible for those who like it to interpret them into a crime:\nthere is no proof in favor of the man outside his own consciousness and\nassertion.”"

Besides, there is a man’s character\nbeforehand to speak for him.”“But, my dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling gently at\nher ardor, “character is not cut in marble—it is not something solid\nand unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become\ndiseased as our bodies do.”“Then it may be rescued and healed,” said Dorothea “I should not be\nafraid of asking Mr. Lydgate to tell me the truth, that I might help\nhim. Why should I be afraid? Now that I am not to have the land, James,\nI might do as Mr. Bulstrode proposed, and take his place in providing\nfor the Hospital; and I have to consult Mr. Lydgate, to know thoroughly\nwhat are the prospects of doing good by keeping up the present plans.\nThere is the best opportunity in the world for me to ask for his\nconfidence; and he would be able to tell me things which might make all\nthe circumstances clear. Then we would all stand by him and bring him\nout of his trouble. People glorify all sorts of bravery except the\nbravery they might show on behalf of their nearest neighbors.”\nDorothea’s eyes had a moist brightness in them, and the changed tones\nof her voice roused her uncle, who began to listen.“It is true that a woman may venture on some efforts of sympathy which\nwould hardly succeed if we men undertook them,” said Mr. Farebrother,\nalmost converted by Dorothea’s ardor.“Surely, a woman is bound to be cautious and listen to those who know\nthe world better than she does.” said Sir James, with his little frown.\n“Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, you should really keep back at\npresent, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode business.\nWe don’t know yet what may turn up. You must agree with me?” he ended,\nlooking at Mr. Farebrother.“I do think it would be better to wait,” said the latter."

Garth has drawn\nme in uncommonly with repairs, draining, that sort of thing: I’m\nuncommonly out of pocket with one thing or another. I must pull up. As\nfor you, Chettam, you are spending a fortune on those oak fences round\nyour demesne.”Dorothea, submitting uneasily to this discouragement, went with Celia\ninto the library, which was her usual drawing-room.“Now, Dodo, do listen to what James says,” said Celia, “else you will\nbe getting into a scrape. You always did, and you always will, when you\nset about doing as you please. And I think it is a mercy now after all\nthat you have got James to think for you. He lets you have your plans,\nonly he hinders you from being taken in. And that is the good of having\na brother instead of a husband. A husband would not let you have your\nplans.”“As if I wanted a husband!” said Dorothea. “I only want not to have my\nfeelings checked at every turn.” Mrs. Casaubon was still undisciplined\nenough to burst into angry tears.“Now, really, Dodo,” said Celia, with rather a deeper guttural than\nusual, “you _are_ contradictory: first one thing and then another. You\nused to submit to Mr. Casaubon quite shamefully: I think you would have\ngiven up ever coming to see me if he had asked you.”“Of course I submitted to him, because it was my duty; it was my\nfeeling for him,” said Dorothea, looking through the prism of her\ntears.“Then why can’t you think it your duty to submit a little to what James\nwishes?” said Celia, with a sense of stringency in her argument.\n“Because he only wishes what is for your own good. And, of course, men\nknow best about everything, except what women know better.” Dorothea\nlaughed and forgot her tears.“Well, I mean about babies and those things,” explained Celia. “I\nshould not give up to James when I knew he was wrong, as you used to do\nto Mr. Casaubon.”CHAPTER LXXIII.Pity the laden one; this wandering woe\nMay visit you and me."

  "content": "When Lydgate had allayed Mrs. Bulstrode’s anxiety by telling her that\nher husband had been seized with faintness at the meeting, but that he\ntrusted soon to see him better and would call again the next day,\nunless she sent for him earlier, he went directly home, got on his\nhorse, and rode three miles out of the town for the sake of being out\nof reach.He felt himself becoming violent and unreasonable as if raging under\nthe pain of stings: he was ready to curse the day on which he had come\nto Middlemarch. Everything that had happened to him there seemed a mere\npreparation for this hateful fatality, which had come as a blight on\nhis honorable ambition, and must make even people who had only vulgar\nstandards regard his reputation as irrevocably damaged. In such moments\na man can hardly escape being unloving. Lydgate thought of himself as\nthe sufferer, and of others as the agents who had injured his lot. He\nhad meant everything to turn out differently; and others had thrust\nthemselves into his life and thwarted his purposes. His marriage seemed\nan unmitigated calamity; and he was afraid of going to Rosamond before\nhe had vented himself in this solitary rage, lest the mere sight of her\nshould exasperate him and make him behave unwarrantably. There are\nepisodes in most men’s lives in which their highest qualities can only\ncast a deterring shadow over the objects that fill their inward vision:\nLydgate’s tenderheartedness was present just then only as a dread lest\nhe should offend against it, not as an emotion that swayed him to\ntenderness. For he was very miserable. Only those who know the\nsupremacy of the intellectual life—the life which has a seed of\nennobling thought and purpose within it—can understand the grief of one\nwho falls from that serene activity into the absorbing soul-wasting\nstruggle with worldly annoyances.How was he to live on without vindicating himself among people who\nsuspected him of baseness? How could he go silently away from\nMiddlemarch as if he were retreating before a just condemnation? And\nyet how was he to set about vindicating himself?"

  "content": "For that scene at the meeting, which he had just witnessed, although it\nhad told him no particulars, had been enough to make his own situation\nthoroughly clear to him. Bulstrode had been in dread of scandalous\ndisclosures on the part of Raffles. Lydgate could now construct all the\nprobabilities of the case. “He was afraid of some betrayal in my\nhearing: all he wanted was to bind me to him by a strong obligation:\nthat was why he passed on a sudden from hardness to liberality. And he\nmay have tampered with the patient—he may have disobeyed my orders. I\nfear he did. But whether he did or not, the world believes that he\nsomehow or other poisoned the man and that I winked at the crime, if I\ndidn’t help in it. And yet—and yet he may not be guilty of the last\noffence; and it is just possible that the change towards me may have\nbeen a genuine relenting—the effect of second thoughts such as he\nalleged. What we call the ‘just possible’ is sometimes true and the\nthing we find it easier to believe is grossly false. In his last\ndealings with this man Bulstrode may have kept his hands pure, in spite\nof my suspicion to the contrary.”There was a benumbing cruelty in his position. Even if he renounced\nevery other consideration than that of justifying himself—if he met\nshrugs, cold glances, and avoidance as an accusation, and made a public\nstatement of all the facts as he knew them, who would be convinced? It\nwould be playing the part of a fool to offer his own testimony on\nbehalf of himself, and say, “I did not take the money as a bribe.” The\ncircumstances would always be stronger than his assertion. And besides,\nto come forward and tell everything about himself must include\ndeclarations about Bulstrode which would darken the suspicions of\nothers against him. He must tell that he had not known of Raffles’s\nexistence when he first mentioned his pressing need of money to\nBulstrode, and that he took the money innocently as a result of that\ncommunication, not knowing that a new motive for the loan might have\narisen on his being called in to this man. And after all, the suspicion\nof Bulstrode’s motives might be unjust.But then came the question whether he should have acted in precisely\nthe same way if he had not taken the money? Certainly, if Raffles had\ncontinued alive and susceptible of further treatment when he arrived,\nand he had then imagined any disobedience to his orders on the part of\nBulstrode, he would have made a strict inquiry, and if his conjecture\nhad been verified he would have thrown up the case, in spite of his\nrecent heavy obligation. But if he had not received any money—if\nBulstrode had never revoked his cold recommendation of bankruptcy—would\nhe, Lydgate, have abstained from all inquiry even on finding the man\ndead?—would the shrinking from an insult to Bulstrode—would the\ndubiousness of all medical treatment and the argument that his own\ntreatment would pass for the wrong with most members of his\nprofession—have had just the same force or significance with him?"

  "content": "That was the uneasy corner of Lydgate’s consciousness while he was\nreviewing the facts and resisting all reproach. If he had been\nindependent, this matter of a patient’s treatment and the distinct rule\nthat he must do or see done that which he believed best for the life\ncommitted to him, would have been the point on which he would have been\nthe sturdiest. As it was, he had rested in the consideration that\ndisobedience to his orders, however it might have arisen, could not be\nconsidered a crime, that in the dominant opinion obedience to his\norders was just as likely to be fatal, and that the affair was simply\none of etiquette. Whereas, again and again, in his time of freedom, he\nhad denounced the perversion of pathological doubt into moral doubt and\nhad said—“the purest experiment in treatment may still be\nconscientious: my business is to take care of life, and to do the best\nI can think of for it. Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma.\nDogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a\ncontest with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive.” Alas! the\nscientific conscience had got into the debasing company of money\nobligation and selfish respects.“Is there a medical man of them all in Middlemarch who would question\nhimself as I do?” said poor Lydgate, with a renewed outburst of\nrebellion against the oppression of his lot. “And yet they will all\nfeel warranted in making a wide space between me and them, as if I were\na leper! My practice and my reputation are utterly damned—I can see\nthat. Even if I could be cleared by valid evidence, it would make\nlittle difference to the blessed world here. I have been set down as\ntainted and should be cheapened to them all the same.”Already there had been abundant signs which had hitherto puzzled him,\nthat just when he had been paying off his debts and getting cheerfully\non his feet, the townsmen were avoiding him or looking strangely at\nhim, and in two instances it came to his knowledge that patients of his\nhad called in another practitioner. The reasons were too plain now. The\ngeneral black-balling had begun."

  "content": "No wonder that in Lydgate’s energetic nature the sense of a hopeless\nmisconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance. The scowl which\noccasionally showed itself on his square brow was not a meaningless\naccident. Already when he was re-entering the town after that ride\ntaken in the first hours of stinging pain, he was setting his mind on\nremaining in Middlemarch in spite of the worst that could be done\nagainst him. He would not retreat before calumny, as if he submitted to\nit. He would face it to the utmost, and no act of his should show that\nhe was afraid. It belonged to the generosity as well as defiant force\nof his nature that he resolved not to shrink from showing to the full\nhis sense of obligation to Bulstrode. It was true that the association\nwith this man had been fatal to him—true that if he had had the\nthousand pounds still in his hands with all his debts unpaid he would\nhave returned the money to Bulstrode, and taken beggary rather than the\nrescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a bribe (for,\nremember, he was one of the proudest among the sons of\nmen)—nevertheless, he would not turn away from this crushed\nfellow-mortal whose aid he had used, and make a pitiful effort to get\nacquittal for himself by howling against another. “I shall do as I\nthink right, and explain to nobody. They will try to starve me out,\nbut—” he was going on with an obstinate resolve, but he was getting\nnear home, and the thought of Rosamond urged itself again into that\nchief place from which it had been thrust by the agonized struggles of\nwounded honor and pride.How would Rosamond take it all? Here was another weight of chain to\ndrag, and poor Lydgate was in a bad mood for bearing her dumb mastery.\nHe had no impulse to tell her the trouble which must soon be common to\nthem both. He preferred waiting for the incidental disclosure which\nevents must soon bring about.CHAPTER LXXIV.“Mercifully grant that we may grow aged together.”\n—BOOK OF TOBIT: _Marriage Prayer_."

  "content": "In Middlemarch a wife could not long remain ignorant that the town held\na bad opinion of her husband. No feminine intimate might carry her\nfriendship so far as to make a plain statement to the wife of the\nunpleasant fact known or believed about her husband; but when a woman\nwith her thoughts much at leisure got them suddenly employed on\nsomething grievously disadvantageous to her neighbors, various moral\nimpulses were called into play which tended to stimulate utterance.\nCandor was one. To be candid, in Middlemarch phraseology, meant, to use\nan early opportunity of letting your friends know that you did not take\na cheerful view of their capacity, their conduct, or their position;\nand a robust candor never waited to be asked for its opinion. Then,\nagain, there was the love of truth—a wide phrase, but meaning in this\nrelation, a lively objection to seeing a wife look happier than her\nhusband’s character warranted, or manifest too much satisfaction in her\nlot—the poor thing should have some hint given her that if she knew the\ntruth she would have less complacency in her bonnet, and in light\ndishes for a supper-party. Stronger than all, there was the regard for\na friend’s moral improvement, sometimes called her soul, which was\nlikely to be benefited by remarks tending to gloom, uttered with the\naccompaniment of pensive staring at the furniture and a manner implying\nthat the speaker would not tell what was on her mind, from regard to\nthe feelings of her hearer. On the whole, one might say that an ardent\ncharity was at work setting the virtuous mind to make a neighbor\nunhappy for her good.There were hardly any wives in Middlemarch whose matrimonial\nmisfortunes would in different ways be likely to call forth more of\nthis moral activity than Rosamond and her aunt Bulstrode. Mrs.\nBulstrode was not an object of dislike, and had never consciously\ninjured any human being. Men had always thought her a handsome\ncomfortable woman, and had reckoned it among the signs of Bulstrode’s\nhypocrisy that he had chosen a red-blooded Vincy, instead of a ghastly\nand melancholy person suited to his low esteem for earthly pleasure.\nWhen the scandal about her husband was disclosed they remarked of\nher—“Ah, poor woman! She’s as honest as the day—_she_ never suspected\nanything wrong in him, you may depend on it.” Women, who were intimate\nwith her, talked together much of “poor Harriet,” imagined what her\nfeelings must be when she came to know everything, and conjectured how\nmuch she had already come to know. There was no spiteful disposition\ntowards her; rather, there was a busy benevolence anxious to ascertain\nwhat it would be well for her to feel and do under the circumstances,\nwhich of course kept the imagination occupied with her character and\nhistory from the times when she was Harriet Vincy till now. With the\nreview of Mrs. Bulstrode and her position it was inevitable to\nassociate Rosamond, whose prospects were under the same blight with her\naunt’s. Rosamond was more severely criticised and less pitied, though\nshe too, as one of the good old Vincy family who had always been known\nin Middlemarch, was regarded as a victim to marriage with an\ninterloper. The Vincys had their weaknesses, but then they lay on the\nsurface: there was never anything bad to be “found out” concerning\nthem. Mrs. Bulstrode was vindicated from any resemblance to her\nhusband. Harriet’s faults were her own."

He keeps to\nthe truth in what is evangelical. It is only clergymen like Mr. Tyke,\nwho want to use Dissenting hymn-books and that low kind of religion,\nwho ever found Bulstrode to their taste.”“I understand, Mr. Tyke is in great distress about him,” said Mrs.\nHackbutt. “And well he may be: they say the Bulstrodes have half kept\nthe Tyke family.”“And of course it is a discredit to his doctrines,” said Mrs. Sprague,\nwho was elderly, and old-fashioned in her opinions.“People will not make a boast of being methodistical in Middlemarch for\na good while to come.”“I think we must not set down people’s bad actions to their religion,”\nsaid falcon-faced Mrs. Plymdale, who had been listening hitherto.“Oh, my dear, we are forgetting,” said Mrs. Sprague. “We ought not to\nbe talking of this before you.”“I am sure I have no reason to be partial,” said Mrs. Plymdale,\ncoloring. “It’s true Mr. Plymdale has always been on good terms with\nMr. Bulstrode, and Harriet Vincy was my friend long before she married\nhim. But I have always kept my own opinions and told her where she was\nwrong, poor thing. Still, in point of religion, I must say, Mr.\nBulstrode might have done what he has, and worse, and yet have been a\nman of no religion. I don’t say that there has not been a little too\nmuch of that—I like moderation myself. But truth is truth. The men\ntried at the assizes are not all over-religious, I suppose.”“Well,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, wheeling adroitly, “all I can say is, that\nI think she ought to separate from him.”"

I should\nexpect to be poisoned.”“Yes, I think myself it is an encouragement to crime if such men are to\nbe taken care of and waited on by good wives,” said Mrs. Tom Toller.“And a good wife poor Harriet has been,” said Mrs. Plymdale. “She\nthinks her husband the first of men. It’s true he has never denied her\nanything.”“Well, we shall see what she will do,” said Mrs. Hackbutt. “I suppose\nshe knows nothing yet, poor creature. I do hope and trust I shall not\nsee her, for I should be frightened to death lest I should say anything\nabout her husband. Do you think any hint has reached her?”“I should hardly think so,” said Mrs. Tom Toller. “We hear that _he_ is\nill, and has never stirred out of the house since the meeting on\nThursday; but she was with her girls at church yesterday, and they had\nnew Tuscan bonnets. Her own had a feather in it. I have never seen that\nher religion made any difference in her dress.”“She wears very neat patterns always,” said Mrs. Plymdale, a little\nstung. “And that feather I know she got dyed a pale lavender on purpose\nto be consistent. I must say it of Harriet that she wishes to do\nright.”“As to her knowing what has happened, it can’t be kept from her long,”\nsaid Mrs. Hackbutt. “The Vincys know, for Mr. Vincy was at the meeting.\nIt will be a great blow to him. There is his daughter as well as his\nsister.”“Yes, indeed,” said Mrs. Sprague. “Nobody supposes that Mr. Lydgate can\ngo on holding up his head in Middlemarch, things look so black about\nthe thousand pounds he took just at that man’s death. It really makes\none shudder.”“Pride must have a fall,” said Mrs. Hackbutt.“I am not so sorry for Rosamond Vincy that was as I am for her aunt,”\nsaid Mrs. Plymdale. “She needed a lesson.”"
