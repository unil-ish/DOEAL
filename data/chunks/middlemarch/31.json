  "content": "“I have not been anywhere except to church for nearly a week,” said\nMrs. Bulstrode, after a few introductory remarks. “But Mr. Bulstrode\nwas taken so ill at the meeting on Thursday that I have not liked to\nleave the house.”Mrs. Hackbutt rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the other\nheld against her chest, and let her eyes ramble over the pattern on the\nrug.“Was Mr. Hackbutt at the meeting?” persevered Mrs. Bulstrode.“Yes, he was,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with the same attitude. “The land is\nto be bought by subscription, I believe.”“Let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be buried\nin it,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “It is an awful visitation. But I always\nthink Middlemarch a very healthy spot. I suppose it is being used to it\nfrom a child; but I never saw the town I should like to live at better,\nand especially our end.”“I am sure I should be glad that you always should live at Middlemarch,\nMrs. Bulstrode,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with a slight sigh. “Still, we\nmust learn to resign ourselves, wherever our lot may be cast. Though I\nam sure there will always be people in this town who will wish you\nwell.”Mrs. Hackbutt longed to say, “if you take my advice you will part from\nyour husband,” but it seemed clear to her that the poor woman knew\nnothing of the thunder ready to bolt on her head, and she herself could\ndo no more than prepare her a little. Mrs. Bulstrode felt suddenly\nrather chill and trembling: there was evidently something unusual\nbehind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt’s; but though she had set out with\nthe desire to be fully informed, she found herself unable now to pursue\nher brave purpose, and turning the conversation by an inquiry about the\nyoung Hackbutts, she soon took her leave saying that she was going to\nsee Mrs. Plymdale. On her way thither she tried to imagine that there\nmight have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr.\nBulstrode and some of his frequent opponents—perhaps Mr. Hackbutt might\nhave been one of them. That would account for everything."

  "content": "But when she was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that comforting\nexplanation seemed no longer tenable. “Selina” received her with a\npathetic affectionateness and a disposition to give edifying answers on\nthe commonest topics, which could hardly have reference to an ordinary\nquarrel of which the most important consequence was a perturbation of\nMr. Bulstrode’s health. Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she\nwould sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but she found to\nher surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is\neasiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered\ncommunication under other circumstances—there was the dislike of being\npitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow her the\nsuperiority. For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that Mrs.\nPlymdale let fall about her resolution never to turn her back on her\nfriends, convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be some\nkind of misfortune, and instead of being able to say with her native\ndirectness, “What is it that you have in your mind?” she found herself\nanxious to get away before she had heard anything more explicit. She\nbegan to have an agitating certainty that the misfortune was something\nmore than the mere loss of money, being keenly sensitive to the fact\nthat Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before, avoided\nnoticing what she said about her husband, as they would have avoided\nnoticing a personal blemish.She said good-by with nervous haste, and told the coachman to drive to\nMr. Vincy’s warehouse. In that short drive her dread gathered so much\nforce from the sense of darkness, that when she entered the private\ncounting-house where her brother sat at his desk, her knees trembled\nand her usually florid face was deathly pale. Something of the same\neffect was produced in him by the sight of her: he rose from his seat\nto meet her, took her by the hand, and said, with his impulsive\nrashness—“God help you, Harriet! you know all.”That moment was perhaps worse than any which came after. It contained\nthat concentrated experience which in great crises of emotion reveals\nthe bias of a nature, and is prophetic of the ultimate act which will\nend an intermediate struggle. Without that memory of Raffles she might\nstill have thought only of monetary ruin, but now along with her\nbrother’s look and words there darted into her mind the idea of some\nguilt in her husband—then, under the working of terror came the image\nof her husband exposed to disgrace—and then, after an instant of\nscorching shame in which she felt only the eyes of the world, with one\nleap of her heart she was at his side in mournful but unreproaching\nfellowship with shame and isolation. All this went on within her in a\nmere flash of time—while she sank into the chair, and raised her eyes\nto her brother, who stood over her. “I know nothing, Walter. What is\nit?” she said, faintly.He told her everything, very inartificially, in slow fragments, making\nher aware that the scandal went much beyond proof, especially as to the\nend of Raffles."

It’s a breakdown blow, and it\ndamages Lydgate as much as Bulstrode. I don’t pretend to say what is\nthe truth. I only wish we had never heard the name of either Bulstrode\nor Lydgate. You’d better have been a Vincy all your life, and so had\nRosamond.” Mrs. Bulstrode made no reply.“But you must bear up as well as you can, Harriet. People don’t blame\n_you_. And I’ll stand by you whatever you make up your mind to do,”\nsaid the brother, with rough but well-meaning affectionateness.“Give me your arm to the carriage, Walter,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “I\nfeel very weak.”And when she got home she was obliged to say to her daughter, “I am not\nwell, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa. Leave me in\nquiet. I shall take no dinner.”She locked herself in her room. She needed time to get used to her\nmaimed consciousness, her poor lopped life, before she could walk\nsteadily to the place allotted her. A new searching light had fallen on\nher husband’s character, and she could not judge him leniently: the\ntwenty years in which she had believed in him and venerated him by\nvirtue of his concealments came back with particulars that made them\nseem an odious deceit. He had married her with that bad past life\nhidden behind him, and she had no faith left to protest his innocence\nof the worst that was imputed to him. Her honest ostentatious nature\nmade the sharing of a merited dishonor as bitter as it could be to any\nmortal."

  "content": "But this imperfectly taught woman, whose phrases and habits were an odd\npatchwork, had a loyal spirit within her. The man whose prosperity she\nhad shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly\ncherished her—now that punishment had befallen him it was not possible\nto her in any sense to forsake him. There is a forsaking which still\nsits at the same board and lies on the same couch with the forsaken\nsoul, withering it the more by unloving proximity. She knew, when she\nlocked her door, that she should unlock it ready to go down to her\nunhappy husband and espouse his sorrow, and say of his guilt, I will\nmourn and not reproach. But she needed time to gather up her strength;\nshe needed to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and pride of her\nlife. When she had resolved to go down, she prepared herself by some\nlittle acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; they were\nher way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she\nhad begun a new life in which she embraced humiliation. She took off\nall her ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of wearing\nher much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she brushed her hair down\nand put on a plain bonnet-cap, which made her look suddenly like an\nearly Methodist.Bulstrode, who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying\nthat she was not well, had spent the time in an agitation equal to\nhers. He had looked forward to her learning the truth from others, and\nhad acquiesced in that probability, as something easier to him than any\nconfession. But now that he imagined the moment of her knowledge come,\nhe awaited the result in anguish. His daughters had been obliged to\nconsent to leave him, and though he had allowed some food to be brought\nto him, he had not touched it. He felt himself perishing slowly in\nunpitied misery. Perhaps he should never see his wife’s face with\naffection in it again. And if he turned to God there seemed to be no\nanswer but the pressure of retribution.It was eight o’clock in the evening before the door opened and his wife\nentered. He dared not look up at her. He sat with his eyes bent down,\nand as she went towards him she thought he looked smaller—he seemed so\nwithered and shrunken. A movement of new compassion and old tenderness\nwent through her like a great wave, and putting one hand on his which\nrested on the arm of the chair, and the other on his shoulder, she\nsaid, solemnly but kindly—“Look up, Nicholas.”He raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half amazed\nfor a moment: her pale face, her changed, mourning dress, the trembling\nabout her mouth, all said, “I know;” and her hands and eyes rested\ngently on him. He burst out crying and they cried together, she sitting\nat his side. They could not yet speak to each other of the shame which\nshe was bearing with him, or of the acts which had brought it down on\nthem. His confession was silent, and her promise of faithfulness was\nsilent. Open-minded as she was, she nevertheless shrank from the words\nwhich would have expressed their mutual consciousness, as she would\nhave shrunk from flakes of fire. She could not say, “How much is only\nslander and false suspicion?” and he did not say, “I am innocent.”CHAPTER LXXV."

  "content": "Rosamond had a gleam of returning cheerfulness when the house was freed\nfrom the threatening figure, and when all the disagreeable creditors\nwere paid. But she was not joyous: her married life had fulfilled none\nof her hopes, and had been quite spoiled for her imagination. In this\nbrief interval of calm, Lydgate, remembering that he had often been\nstormy in his hours of perturbation, and mindful of the pain Rosamond\nhad had to bear, was carefully gentle towards her; but he, too, had\nlost some of his old spirit, and he still felt it necessary to refer to\nan economical change in their way of living as a matter of course,\ntrying to reconcile her to it gradually, and repressing his anger when\nshe answered by wishing that he would go to live in London. When she\ndid not make this answer, she listened languidly, and wondered what she\nhad that was worth living for. The hard and contemptuous words which\nhad fallen from her husband in his anger had deeply offended that\nvanity which he had at first called into active enjoyment; and what she\nregarded as his perverse way of looking at things, kept up a secret\nrepulsion, which made her receive all his tenderness as a poor\nsubstitute for the happiness he had failed to give her. They were at a\ndisadvantage with their neighbors, and there was no longer any outlook\ntowards Quallingham—there was no outlook anywhere except in an\noccasional letter from Will Ladislaw. She had felt stung and\ndisappointed by Will’s resolution to quit Middlemarch, for in spite of\nwhat she knew and guessed about his admiration for Dorothea, she\nsecretly cherished the belief that he had, or would necessarily come to\nhave, much more admiration for herself; Rosamond being one of those\nwomen who live much in the idea that each man they meet would have\npreferred them if the preference had not been hopeless. Mrs. Casaubon\nwas all very well; but Will’s interest in her dated before he knew Mrs.\nLydgate. Rosamond took his way of talking to herself, which was a\nmixture of playful fault-finding and hyperbolical gallantry, as the\ndisguise of a deeper feeling; and in his presence she felt that\nagreeable titillation of vanity and sense of romantic drama which\nLydgate’s presence had no longer the magic to create. She even\nfancied—what will not men and women fancy in these matters?—that Will\nexaggerated his admiration for Mrs. Casaubon in order to pique herself.\nIn this way poor Rosamond’s brain had been busy before Will’s\ndeparture. He would have made, she thought, a much more suitable\nhusband for her than she had found in Lydgate. No notion could have\nbeen falser than this, for Rosamond’s discontent in her marriage was\ndue to the conditions of marriage itself, to its demand for\nself-suppression and tolerance, and not to the nature of her husband;\nbut the easy conception of an unreal Better had a sentimental charm\nwhich diverted her ennui. She constructed a little romance which was to\nvary the flatness of her life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a\nbachelor and live near her, always to be at her command, and have an\nunderstood though never fully expressed passion for her, which would be\nsending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes.\nHis departure had been a proportionate disappointment, and had sadly\nincreased her weariness of Middlemarch; but at first she had the\nalternative dream of pleasures in store from her intercourse with the\nfamily at Quallingham. Since then the troubles of her married life had\ndeepened, and the absence of other relief encouraged her regretful\nrumination over that thin romance which she had once fed on. Men and\nwomen make sad mistakes about their own symptoms, taking their vague\nuneasy longings, sometimes for genius, sometimes for religion, and\noftener still for a mighty love. Will Ladislaw had written chatty\nletters, half to her and half to Lydgate, and she had replied: their\nseparation, she felt, was not likely to be final, and the change she\nnow most longed for was that Lydgate should go to live in London;\neverything would be agreeable in London; and she had set to work with\nquiet determination to win this result, when there came a sudden,\ndelightful promise which inspirited her."

  "content": "It came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town-hall, and was\nnothing less than a letter from Will Ladislaw to Lydgate, which turned\nindeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization, but\nmentioned incidentally, that he might find it necessary to pay a visit\nto Middlemarch within the next few weeks—a very pleasant necessity, he\nsaid, almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy. He hoped there was his\nold place on the rug, and a great deal of music in store for him. But\nhe was quite uncertain as to the time. While Lydgate was reading the\nletter to Rosamond, her face looked like a reviving flower—it grew\nprettier and more blooming. There was nothing unendurable now: the\ndebts were paid, Mr. Ladislaw was coming, and Lydgate would be\npersuaded to leave Middlemarch and settle in London, which was “so\ndifferent from a provincial town.”"

  "content": "That was a bright bit of morning. But soon the sky became black over\npoor Rosamond. The presence of a new gloom in her husband, about which\nhe was entirely reserved towards her—for he dreaded to expose his\nlacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception—soon received a\npainfully strange explanation, alien to all her previous notions of\nwhat could affect her happiness. In the new gayety of her spirits,\nthinking that Lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual,\ncausing him to leave her remarks unanswered, and evidently to keep out\nof her way as much as possible, she chose, a few days after the\nmeeting, and without speaking to him on the subject, to send out notes\nof invitation for a small evening party, feeling convinced that this\nwas a judicious step, since people seemed to have been keeping aloof\nfrom them, and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse. When\nthe invitations had been accepted, she would tell Lydgate, and give him\na wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his\nneighbors; for Rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about\nother people’s duties. But all the invitations were declined, and the\nlast answer came into Lydgate’s hands.“This is Chichely’s scratch. What is he writing to you about?” said\nLydgate, wonderingly, as he handed the note to her. She was obliged to\nlet him see it, and, looking at her severely, he said—“Why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me,\nRosamond? I beg, I insist that you will not invite any one to this\nhouse. I suppose you have been inviting others, and they have refused\ntoo.” She said nothing.“Do you hear me?” thundered Lydgate.“Yes, certainly I hear you,” said Rosamond, turning her head aside with\nthe movement of a graceful long-necked bird.Lydgate tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room,\nfeeling himself dangerous. Rosamond’s thought was, that he was getting\nmore and more unbearable—not that there was any new special reason for\nthis peremptoriness. His indisposition to tell her anything in which he\nwas sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into\nan unreflecting habit, and she was in ignorance of everything connected\nwith the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle\nBulstrode. Lydgate’s odious humors and their neighbors’ apparent\navoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief\nfrom money difficulties. If the invitations had been accepted she would\nhave gone to invite her mamma and the rest, whom she had seen nothing\nof for several days; and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire\nwhat had become of them all, suddenly feeling as if there were a\nconspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend\neverybody. It was after the dinner hour, and she found her father and\nmother seated together alone in the drawing-room. They greeted her with\nsad looks, saying “Well, my dear!” and no more. She had never seen her\nfather look so downcast; and seating herself near him she said—“Is there anything the matter, papa?”He did not answer, but Mrs. Vincy said, “Oh, my dear, have you heard\nnothing? It won’t be long before it reaches you.”"

To think of your marrying into this trouble. Debt\nwas bad enough, but this will be worse.”“Stay, stay, Lucy,” said Mr. Vincy. “Have you heard nothing about your\nuncle Bulstrode, Rosamond?”“No, papa,” said the poor thing, feeling as if trouble were not\nanything she had before experienced, but some invisible power with an\niron grasp that made her soul faint within her.Her father told her everything, saying at the end, “It’s better for you\nto know, my dear. I think Lydgate must leave the town. Things have gone\nagainst him. I dare say he couldn’t help it. I don’t accuse him of any\nharm,” said Mr. Vincy. He had always before been disposed to find the\nutmost fault with Lydgate.The shock to Rosamond was terrible. It seemed to her that no lot could\nbe so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the\ncentre of infamous suspicions. In many cases it is inevitable that the\nshame is felt to be the worst part of crime; and it would have required\na great deal of disentangling reflection, such as had never entered\ninto Rosamond’s life, for her in these moments to feel that her trouble\nwas less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done\nsomething criminal. All the shame seemed to be there. And she had\ninnocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were\na glory to her! She showed her usual reticence to her parents, and only\nsaid, that if Lydgate had done as she wished he would have left\nMiddlemarch long ago.“She bears it beyond anything,” said her mother when she was gone.“Ah, thank God!” said Mr. Vincy, who was much broken down."

  "content": "But Rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her\nhusband. What had he really done—how had he really acted? She did not\nknow. Why had he not told her everything? He did not speak to her on\nthe subject, and of course she could not speak to him. It came into her\nmind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again; but\ndwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her: a\nmarried woman gone back to live with her parents—life seemed to have no\nmeaning for her in such a position: she could not contemplate herself\nin it.The next two days Lydgate observed a change in her, and believed that\nshe had heard the bad news. Would she speak to him about it, or would\nshe go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she\nbelieved him guilty? We must remember that he was in a morbid state of\nmind, in which almost all contact was pain. Certainly Rosamond in this\ncase had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on\nhis part; but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself;—was he\nnot justified in shrinking from the task of telling her, since now she\nknew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him? But a deeper-lying\nconsciousness that he was in fault made him restless, and the silence\nbetween them became intolerable to him; it was as if they were both\nadrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other.He thought, “I am a fool. Haven’t I given up expecting anything? I have\nmarried care, not help.” And that evening he said—“Rosamond, have you heard anything that distresses you?”“Yes,” she answered, laying down her work, which she had been carrying\non with a languid semi-consciousness, most unlike her usual self.“What have you heard?”“Everything, I suppose. Papa told me.”“That people think me disgraced?”“Yes,” said Rosamond, faintly, beginning to sew again automatically.There was silence. Lydgate thought, “If she has any trust in me—any\nnotion of what I am, she ought to speak now and say that she does not\nbelieve I have deserved disgrace.”But Rosamond on her side went on moving her fingers languidly. Whatever\nwas to be said on the subject she expected to come from Tertius. What\ndid she know? And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do\nsomething to clear himself?"

  "content": "This silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in\nwhich Lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in\nhim—even Farebrother had not come forward. He had begun to question her\nwith the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog\nwhich had gathered between them, but he felt his resolution checked by\ndespairing resentment. Even this trouble, like the rest, she seemed to\nregard as if it were hers alone. He was always to her a being apart,\ndoing what she objected to. He started from his chair with an angry\nimpulse, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, walked up and down the\nroom. There was an underlying consciousness all the while that he\nshould have to master this anger, and tell her everything, and convince\nher of the facts. For he had almost learned the lesson that he must\nbend himself to her nature, and that because she came short in her\nsympathy, he must give the more. Soon he recurred to his intention of\nopening himself: the occasion must not be lost. If he could bring her\nto feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met\nand not run away from, and that the whole trouble had come out of his\ndesperate want of money, it would be a moment for urging powerfully on\nher that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money\nas possible, so that they might weather the bad time and keep\nthemselves independent. He would mention the definite measures which he\ndesired to take, and win her to a willing spirit. He was bound to try\nthis—and what else was there for him to do?He did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and\nforwards, but Rosamond felt that it was long, and wished that he would\nsit down. She too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on\nTertius what he ought to do. Whatever might be the truth about all this\nmisery, there was one dread which asserted itself.Lydgate at last seated himself, not in his usual chair, but in one\nnearer to Rosamond, leaning aside in it towards her, and looking at her\ngravely before he reopened the sad subject. He had conquered himself so\nfar, and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity, as on an\noccasion which was not to be repeated. He had even opened his lips,\nwhen Rosamond, letting her hands fall, looked at him and said—“Surely, Tertius—”“Well?”“Surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in\nMiddlemarch. I cannot go on living here. Let us go to London. Papa, and\nevery one else, says you had better go. Whatever misery I have to put\nup with, it will be easier away from here.”Lydgate felt miserably jarred. Instead of that critical outpouring for\nwhich he had prepared himself with effort, here was the old round to be\ngone through again. He could not bear it. With a quick change of\ncountenance he rose and went out of the room.Perhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to\nbe the more because she was less, that evening might have had a better\nissue. If his energy could have borne down that check, he might still\nhave wrought on Rosamond’s vision and will. We cannot be sure that any\nnatures, however inflexible or peculiar, will resist this effect from a\nmore massive being than their own. They may be taken by storm and for\nthe moment converted, becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in\nthe ardor of its movement. But poor Lydgate had a throbbing pain within\nhim, and his energy had fallen short of its task."

The summons had not been unexpected, since it\nhad followed a letter from Mr. Bulstrode, in which he stated that he\nhad resumed his arrangements for quitting Middlemarch, and must remind\nLydgate of his previous communications about the Hospital, to the\npurport of which he still adhered. It had been his duty, before taking\nfurther steps, to reopen the subject with Mrs. Casaubon, who now\nwished, as before, to discuss the question with Lydgate. “Your views\nmay possibly have undergone some change,” wrote Mr. Bulstrode; “but, in\nthat case also, it is desirable that you should lay them before her.”"

Though, in deference\nto her masculine advisers, she had refrained from what Sir James had\ncalled “interfering in this Bulstrode business,” the hardship of\nLydgate’s position was continually in her mind, and when Bulstrode\napplied to her again about the hospital, she felt that the opportunity\nwas come to her which she had been hindered from hastening. In her\nluxurious home, wandering under the boughs of her own great trees, her\nthought was going out over the lot of others, and her emotions were\nimprisoned. The idea of some active good within her reach, “haunted her\nlike a passion,” and another’s need having once come to her as a\ndistinct image, preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give\nrelief, and made her own ease tasteless. She was full of confident hope\nabout this interview with Lydgate, never heeding what was said of his\npersonal reserve; never heeding that she was a very young woman.\nNothing could have seemed more irrelevant to Dorothea than insistence\non her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship.As she sat waiting in the library, she could do nothing but live\nthrough again all the past scenes which had brought Lydgate into her\nmemories. They all owed their significance to her marriage and its\ntroubles—but no; there were two occasions in which the image of Lydgate\nhad come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else. The\npain had been allayed for Dorothea, but it had left in her an awakened\nconjecture as to what Lydgate’s marriage might be to him, a\nsusceptibility to the slightest hint about Mrs. Lydgate. These thoughts\nwere like a drama to her, and made her eyes bright, and gave an\nattitude of suspense to her whole frame, though she was only looking\nout from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds\nwhich stood in relief against the dark evergreens.When Lydgate came in, she was almost shocked at the change in his face,\nwhich was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two\nmonths. It was not the change of emaciation, but that effect which even\nyoung faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of\nresentment and despondency. Her cordial look, when she put out her hand\nto him, softened his expression, but only with melancholy.“I have wished very much to see you for a long while, Mr. Lydgate,”\nsaid Dorothea when they were seated opposite each other; “but I put off\nasking you to come until Mr. Bulstrode applied to me again about the\nHospital. I know that the advantage of keeping the management of it\nseparate from that of the Infirmary depends on you, or, at least, on\nthe good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your\ncontrol. And I am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you\nthink.”“You want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the\nHospital,” said Lydgate. “I cannot conscientiously advise you to do it\nin dependence on any activity of mine. I may be obliged to leave the\ntown.”"

I knew them from the first moment to be mistakes.\nYou have never done anything vile. You would not do anything\ndishonorable.”It was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on\nLydgate’s ears. He drew a deep breath, and said, “Thank you.” He could\nsay no more: it was something very new and strange in his life that\nthese few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him.“I beseech you to tell me how everything was,” said Dorothea,\nfearlessly. “I am sure that the truth would clear you.”Lydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window,\nforgetting where he was. He had so often gone over in his mind the\npossibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances\nthat would tell, perhaps unfairly, against Bulstrode, and had so often\ndecided against it—he had so often said to himself that his assertions\nwould not change people’s impressions—that Dorothea’s words sounded\nlike a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had\npronounced to be unreasonable.“Tell me, pray,” said Dorothea, with simple earnestness; “then we can\nconsult together. It is wicked to let people think evil of any one\nfalsely, when it can be hindered.”Lydgate turned, remembering where he was, and saw Dorothea’s face\nlooking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity. The presence of a\nnoble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes\nthe lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger,\nquieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in\nthe wholeness of our character. That influence was beginning to act on\nLydgate, who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is\ndragged and struggling amid the throng. He sat down again, and felt\nthat he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was\nwith one who believed in it."

He is hunted down and miserable, and has only a poor thread of\nlife in him. But I should like to tell you everything. It will be a\ncomfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand, and where I\nshall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty. You will\nfeel what is fair to another, as you feel what is fair to me.”“Do trust me,” said Dorothea; “I will not repeat anything without your\nleave. But at the very least, I could say that you have made all the\ncircumstances clear to me, and that I know you are not in any way\nguilty. Mr. Farebrother would believe me, and my uncle, and Sir James\nChettam. Nay, there are persons in Middlemarch to whom I could go;\nalthough they don’t know much of me, they would believe me. They would\nknow that I could have no other motive than truth and justice. I would\ntake any pains to clear you. I have very little to do. There is nothing\nbetter that I can do in the world.”Dorothea’s voice, as she made this childlike picture of what she would\ndo, might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it\neffectively. The searching tenderness of her woman’s tones seemed made\nfor a defence against ready accusers. Lydgate did not stay to think\nthat she was Quixotic: he gave himself up, for the first time in his\nlife, to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous\nsympathy, without any check of proud reserve. And he told her\neverything, from the time when, under the pressure of his difficulties,\nhe unwillingly made his first application to Bulstrode; gradually, in\nthe relief of speaking, getting into a more thorough utterance of what\nhad gone on in his mind—entering fully into the fact that his treatment\nof the patient was opposed to the dominant practice, into his doubts at\nthe last, his ideal of medical duty, and his uneasy consciousness that\nthe acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private\ninclination and professional behavior, though not in his fulfilment of\nany publicly recognized obligation."

But that would not have been opposed to ordinary\nprescriptions, even of first-rate men. The suspicions against me had no\nhold there: they are grounded on the knowledge that I took money, that\nBulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die, and that he\ngave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other\nagainst the patient—that in any case I accepted a bribe to hold my\ntongue. They are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately,\nbecause they lie in people’s inclination and can never be disproved.\nHow my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which I don’t know\nthe answer. It is still possible that Bulstrode was innocent of any\ncriminal intention—even possible that he had nothing to do with the\ndisobedience, and merely abstained from mentioning it. But all that has\nnothing to do with the public belief. It is one of those cases on which\na man is condemned on the ground of his character—it is believed that\nhe has committed a crime in some undefined way, because he had the\nmotive for doing it; and Bulstrode’s character has enveloped me,\nbecause I took his money. I am simply blighted—like a damaged ear of\ncorn—the business is done and can’t be undone.”“Oh, it is hard!” said Dorothea. “I understand the difficulty there is\nin your vindicating yourself. And that all this should have come to you\nwho had meant to lead a higher life than the common, and to find out\nbetter ways—I cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable. I know you\nmeant that. I remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me\nabout the hospital. There is no sorrow I have thought more about than\nthat—to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail.”“Yes,” said Lydgate, feeling that here he had found room for the full\nmeaning of his grief. “I had some ambition. I meant everything to be\ndifferent with me. I thought I had more strength and mastery. But the\nmost terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself.”“Suppose,” said Dorothea, meditatively,—“suppose we kept on the\nHospital according to the present plan, and you stayed here though only\nwith the friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling towards you\nwould gradually die out; there would come opportunities in which people\nwould be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you,\nbecause they would see that your purposes were pure. You may still win\na great fame like the Louis and Laennec I have heard you speak of, and\nwe shall all be proud of you,” she ended, with a smile.“That might do if I had my old trust in myself,” said Lydgate,\nmournfully. “Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and\nrunning away before this slander, leaving it unchecked behind me.\nStill, I can’t ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan\nwhich depends on me.”"

  "content": "“It would be quite worth my while,” said Dorothea, simply. “Only think.\nI am very uncomfortable with my money, because they tell me I have too\nlittle for any great scheme of the sort I like best, and yet I have too\nmuch. I don’t know what to do. I have seven hundred a-year of my own\nfortune, and nineteen hundred a-year that Mr. Casaubon left me, and\nbetween three and four thousand of ready money in the bank. I wished to\nraise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which I don’t\nwant, to buy land with and found a village which should be a school of\nindustry; but Sir James and my uncle have convinced me that the risk\nwould be too great. So you see that what I should most rejoice at would\nbe to have something good to do with my money: I should like it to make\nother people’s lives better to them. It makes me very uneasy—coming all\nto me who don’t want it.”A smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate’s face. The childlike\ngrave-eyed earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was\nirresistible—blent into an adorable whole with her ready understanding\nof high experience. (Of lower experience such as plays a great part in\nthe world, poor Mrs. Casaubon had a very blurred shortsighted\nknowledge, little helped by her imagination.) But she took the smile as\nencouragement of her plan.“I think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously,” she said, in a\ntone of persuasion. “The hospital would be one good; and making your\nlife quite whole and well again would be another.”Lydgate’s smile had died away. “You have the goodness as well as the\nmoney to do all that; if it could be done,” he said. “But—”He hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window; and\nshe sat in silent expectation. At last he turned towards her and said\nimpetuously—“Why should I not tell you?—you know what sort of bond marriage is. You\nwill understand everything.”Dorothea felt her heart beginning to beat faster. Had he that sorrow\ntoo? But she feared to say any word, and he went on immediately.“It is impossible for me now to do anything—to take any step without\nconsidering my wife’s happiness. The thing that I might like to do if I\nwere alone, is become impossible to me. I can’t see her miserable. She\nmarried me without knowing what she was going into, and it might have\nbeen better for her if she had not married me.”“I know, I know—you could not give her pain, if you were not obliged to\ndo it,” said Dorothea, with keen memory of her own life.“And she has set her mind against staying. She wishes to go. The\ntroubles she has had here have wearied her,” said Lydgate, breaking off\nagain, lest he should say too much.“But when she saw the good that might come of staying—” said Dorothea,\nremonstrantly, looking at Lydgate as if he had forgotten the reasons\nwhich had just been considered. He did not speak immediately."

  "content": "“She would not see it,” he said at last, curtly, feeling at first that\nthis statement must do without explanation. “And, indeed, I have lost\nall spirit about carrying on my life here.” He paused a moment and\nthen, following the impulse to let Dorothea see deeper into the\ndifficulty of his life, he said, “The fact is, this trouble has come\nupon her confusedly. We have not been able to speak to each other about\nit. I am not sure what is in her mind about it: she may fear that I\nhave really done something base. It is my fault; I ought to be more\nopen. But I have been suffering cruelly.”“May I go and see her?” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Would she accept my\nsympathy? I would tell her that you have not been blamable before any\none’s judgment but your own. I would tell her that you shall be cleared\nin every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may\ngo to see her? I did see her once.”“I am sure you may,” said Lydgate, seizing the proposition with some\nhope. “She would feel honored—cheered, I think, by the proof that you\nat least have some respect for me. I will not speak to her about your\ncoming—that she may not connect it with my wishes at all. I know very\nwell that I ought not to have left anything to be told her by others,\nbut—”He broke off, and there was a moment’s silence. Dorothea refrained from\nsaying what was in her mind—how well she knew that there might be\ninvisible barriers to speech between husband and wife. This was a point\non which even sympathy might make a wound. She returned to the more\noutward aspect of Lydgate’s position, saying cheerfully—“And if Mrs. Lydgate knew that there were friends who would believe in\nyou and support you, she might then be glad that you should stay in\nyour place and recover your hopes—and do what you meant to do. Perhaps\nthen you would see that it was right to agree with what I proposed\nabout your continuing at the Hospital. Surely you would, if you still\nhave faith in it as a means of making your knowledge useful?”Lydgate did not answer, and she saw that he was debating with himself.“You need not decide immediately,” she said, gently. “A few days hence\nit will be early enough for me to send my answer to Mr. Bulstrode.”Lydgate still waited, but at last turned to speak in his most decisive\ntones."

I am\nno longer sure enough of myself—I mean of what it would be possible for\nme to do under the changed circumstances of my life. It would be\ndishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in\ndependence on me. I might be obliged to go away after all; I see little\nchance of anything else. The whole thing is too problematic; I cannot\nconsent to be the cause of your goodness being wasted. No—let the new\nHospital be joined with the old Infirmary, and everything go on as it\nmight have done if I had never come. I have kept a valuable register\nsince I have been there; I shall send it to a man who will make use of\nit,” he ended bitterly. “I can think of nothing for a long while but\ngetting an income.”“It hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly,” said Dorothea.\n“It would be a happiness to your friends, who believe in your future,\nin your power to do great things, if you would let them save you from\nthat. Think how much money I have; it would be like taking a burthen\nfrom me if you took some of it every year till you got free from this\nfettering want of income. Why should not people do these things? It is\nso difficult to make shares at all even. This is one way.”“God bless you, Mrs. Casaubon!” said Lydgate, rising as if with the\nsame impulse that made his words energetic, and resting his arm on the\nback of the great leather chair he had been sitting in. “It is good\nthat you should have such feelings. But I am not the man who ought to\nallow himself to benefit by them. I have not given guarantees enough. I\nmust not at least sink into the degradation of being pensioned for work\nthat I never achieved. It is very clear to me that I must not count on\nanything else than getting away from Middlemarch as soon as I can\nmanage it. I should not be able for a long while, at the very best, to\nget an income here, and—and it is easier to make necessary changes in a\nnew place. I must do as other men do, and think what will please the\nworld and bring in money; look for a little opening in the London\ncrowd, and push myself; set up in a watering-place, or go to some\nsouthern town where there are plenty of idle English, and get myself\npuffed,—that is the sort of shell I must creep into and try to keep my\nsoul alive in.”“Now that is not brave,” said Dorothea,—“to give up the fight.”"

Everything seems more\nbearable since I have talked to you; and if you can clear me in a few\nother minds, especially in Farebrother’s, I shall be deeply grateful.\nThe point I wish you not to mention is the fact of disobedience to my\norders. That would soon get distorted. After all, there is no evidence\nfor me but people’s opinion of me beforehand. You can only repeat my\nown report of myself.”“Mr. Farebrother will believe—others will believe,” said Dorothea. “I\ncan say of you what will make it stupidity to suppose that you would be\nbribed to do a wickedness.”“I don’t know,” said Lydgate, with something like a groan in his voice.\n“I have not taken a bribe yet. But there is a pale shade of bribery\nwhich is sometimes called prosperity. You will do me another great\nkindness, then, and come to see my wife?”“Yes, I will. I remember how pretty she is,” said Dorothea, into whose\nmind every impression about Rosamond had cut deep. “I hope she will\nlike me.”As Lydgate rode away, he thought, “This young creature has a heart\nlarge enough for the Virgin Mary. She evidently thinks nothing of her\nown future, and would pledge away half her income at once, as if she\nwanted nothing for herself but a chair to sit in from which she can\nlook down with those clear eyes at the poor mortals who pray to her.\nShe seems to have what I never saw in any woman before—a fountain of\nfriendship towards men—a man can make a friend of her. Casaubon must\nhave raised some heroic hallucination in her. I wonder if she could\nhave any other sort of passion for a man? Ladislaw?—there was certainly\nan unusual feeling between them. And Casaubon must have had a notion of\nit. Well—her love might help a man more than her money.”"
