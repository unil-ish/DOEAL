  "content": "She sat to-night revolving, as she was wont, the scenes of the day, her\nlips often curling with amusement at the oddities to which her fancy\nadded fresh drollery: people were so ridiculous with their illusions,\ncarrying their fool’s caps unawares, thinking their own lies opaque\nwhile everybody else’s were transparent, making themselves exceptions\nto everything, as if when all the world looked yellow under a lamp they\nalone were rosy. Yet there were some illusions under Mary’s eyes which\nwere not quite comic to her. She was secretly convinced, though she had\nno other grounds than her close observation of old Featherstone’s\nnature, that in spite of his fondness for having the Vincys about him,\nthey were as likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom he\nkept at a distance. She had a good deal of disdain for Mrs. Vincy’s\nevident alarm lest she and Fred should be alone together, but it did\nnot hinder her from thinking anxiously of the way in which Fred would\nbe affected, if it should turn out that his uncle had left him as poor\nas ever. She could make a butt of Fred when he was present, but she did\nnot enjoy his follies when he was absent.Yet she liked her thoughts: a vigorous young mind not overbalanced by\npassion, finds a good in making acquaintance with life, and watches its\nown powers with interest. Mary had plenty of merriment within.Her thought was not veined by any solemnity or pathos about the old man\non the bed: such sentiments are easier to affect than to feel about an\naged creature whose life is not visibly anything but a remnant of\nvices. She had always seen the most disagreeable side of Mr.\nFeatherstone: he was not proud of her, and she was only useful to him.\nTo be anxious about a soul that is always snapping at you must be left\nto the saints of the earth; and Mary was not one of them. She had never\nreturned him a harsh word, and had waited on him faithfully: that was\nher utmost. Old Featherstone himself was not in the least anxious about\nhis soul, and had declined to see Mr. Tucker on the subject.To-night he had not snapped, and for the first hour or two he lay\nremarkably still, until at last Mary heard him rattling his bunch of\nkeys against the tin box which he always kept in the bed beside him.\nAbout three o’clock he said, with remarkable distinctness, “Missy, come\nhere!”Mary obeyed, and found that he had already drawn the tin box from under\nthe clothes, though he usually asked to have this done for him; and he\nhad selected the key. He now unlocked the box, and, drawing from it\nanother key, looked straight at her with eyes that seemed to have\nrecovered all their sharpness and said, “How many of ’em are in the\nhouse?”“You mean of your own relations, sir,” said Mary, well used to the old\nman’s way of speech. He nodded slightly and she went on.“Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch are sleeping here.”“Oh ay, they stick, do they? and the rest—they come every day, I’ll\nwarrant—Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns? They come peeping, and\ncounting and casting up?”“Not all of them every day. Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule are here every\nday, and the others come often.”"

It’s three\no’clock in the morning, and I’ve got all my faculties as well as ever I\nhad in my life. I know all my property, and where the money’s put out,\nand everything. And I’ve made everything ready to change my mind, and\ndo as I like at the last. Do you hear, missy? I’ve got my faculties.”“Well, sir?” said Mary, quietly.He now lowered his tone with an air of deeper cunning. “I’ve made two\nwills, and I’m going to burn one. Now you do as I tell you. This is the\nkey of my iron chest, in the closet there. You push well at the side of\nthe brass plate at the top, till it goes like a bolt: then you can put\nthe key in the front lock and turn it. See and do that; and take out\nthe topmost paper—Last Will and Testament—big printed.”“No, sir,” said Mary, in a firm voice, “I cannot do that.”“Not do it? I tell you, you must,” said the old man, his voice\nbeginning to shake under the shock of this resistance.“I cannot touch your iron chest or your will. I must refuse to do\nanything that might lay me open to suspicion.”“I tell you, I’m in my right mind. Shan’t I do as I like at the last? I\nmade two wills on purpose. Take the key, I say.”“No, sir, I will not,” said Mary, more resolutely still. Her repulsion\nwas getting stronger.“I tell you, there’s no time to lose.”“I cannot help that, sir. I will not let the close of your life soil\nthe beginning of mine. I will not touch your iron chest or your will.”\nShe moved to a little distance from the bedside.The old man paused with a blank stare for a little while, holding the\none key erect on the ring; then with an agitated jerk he began to work\nwith his bony left hand at emptying the tin box before him.“Missy,” he began to say, hurriedly, “look here! take the money—the\nnotes and gold—look here—take it—you shall have it all—do as I tell\nyou.”He made an effort to stretch out the key towards her as far as\npossible, and Mary again retreated.“I will not touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don’t ask me to do\nit again. If you do, I must go and call your brother.”"

She said, in as gentle a\ntone as she could command, “Pray put up your money, sir;” and then went\naway to her seat by the fire, hoping this would help to convince him\nthat it was useless to say more. Presently he rallied and said eagerly—“Look here, then. Call the young chap. Call Fred Vincy.”Mary’s heart began to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed through\nher mind as to what the burning of a second will might imply. She had\nto make a difficult decision in a hurry.“I will call him, if you will let me call Mr. Jonah and others with\nhim.”“Nobody else, I say. The young chap. I shall do as I like.”“Wait till broad daylight, sir, when every one is stirring. Or let me\ncall Simmons now, to go and fetch the lawyer? He can be here in less\nthan two hours.”“Lawyer? What do I want with the lawyer? Nobody shall know—I say,\nnobody shall know. I shall do as I like.”“Let me call some one else, sir,” said Mary, persuasively. She did not\nlike her position—alone with the old man, who seemed to show a strange\nflaring of nervous energy which enabled him to speak again and again\nwithout falling into his usual cough; yet she desired not to push\nunnecessarily the contradiction which agitated him. “Let me, pray, call\nsome one else.”“You let me alone, I say. Look here, missy. Take the money. You’ll\nnever have the chance again. It’s pretty nigh two hundred—there’s more\nin the box, and nobody knows how much there was. Take it and do as I\ntell you.”Mary, standing by the fire, saw its red light falling on the old man,\npropped up on his pillows and bed-rest, with his bony hand holding out\nthe key, and the money lying on the quilt before him. She never forgot\nthat vision of a man wanting to do as he liked at the last. But the way\nin which he had put the offer of the money urged her to speak with\nharder resolution than ever.“It is of no use, sir. I will not do it. Put up your money. I will not\ntouch your money. I will do anything else I can to comfort you; but I\nwill not touch your keys or your money.”“Anything else—anything else!” said old Featherstone, with hoarse rage,\nwhich, as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet was only just\naudible. “I want nothing else. You come here—you come here.”"

  "content": "Mary approached him cautiously, knowing him too well. She saw him\ndropping his keys and trying to grasp his stick, while he looked at her\nlike an aged hyena, the muscles of his face getting distorted with the\neffort of his hand. She paused at a safe distance.“Let me give you some cordial,” she said, quietly, “and try to compose\nyourself. You will perhaps go to sleep. And to-morrow by daylight you\ncan do as you like.”He lifted the stick, in spite of her being beyond his reach, and threw\nit with a hard effort which was but impotence. It fell, slipping over\nthe foot of the bed. Mary let it lie, and retreated to her chair by the\nfire. By-and-by she would go to him with the cordial. Fatigue would\nmake him passive. It was getting towards the chillest moment of the\nmorning, the fire had got low, and she could see through the chink\nbetween the moreen window-curtains the light whitened by the blind.\nHaving put some wood on the fire and thrown a shawl over her, she sat\ndown, hoping that Mr. Featherstone might now fall asleep. If she went\nnear him the irritation might be kept up. He had said nothing after\nthrowing the stick, but she had seen him taking his keys again and\nlaying his right hand on the money. He did not put it up, however, and\nshe thought that he was dropping off to sleep.But Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what\nshe had gone through, than she had been by the reality—questioning\nthose acts of hers which had come imperatively and excluded all\nquestion in the critical moment.Presently the dry wood sent out a flame which illuminated every\ncrevice, and Mary saw that the old man was lying quietly with his head\nturned a little on one side. She went towards him with inaudible steps,\nand thought that his face looked strangely motionless; but the next\nmoment the movement of the flame communicating itself to all objects\nmade her uncertain. The violent beating of her heart rendered her\nperceptions so doubtful that even when she touched him and listened for\nhis breathing, she could not trust her conclusions. She went to the\nwindow and gently propped aside the curtain and blind, so that the\nstill light of the sky fell on the bed."

In a\nvery little while there was no longer any doubt that Peter Featherstone\nwas dead, with his right hand clasping the keys, and his left hand\nlying on the heap of notes and gold.BOOK IV.\nTHREE LOVE PROBLEMS.CHAPTER XXXIV.“1_st Gent_.

  "content": "It was on a morning of May that Peter Featherstone was buried. In the\nprosaic neighborhood of Middlemarch, May was not always warm and sunny,\nand on this particular morning a chill wind was blowing the blossoms\nfrom the surrounding gardens on to the green mounds of Lowick\nchurchyard. Swiftly moving clouds only now and then allowed a gleam to\nlight up any object, whether ugly or beautiful, that happened to stand\nwithin its golden shower. In the churchyard the objects were remarkably\nvarious, for there was a little country crowd waiting to see the\nfuneral. The news had spread that it was to be a “big burying;” the old\ngentleman had left written directions about everything and meant to\nhave a funeral “beyond his betters.” This was true; for old\nFeatherstone had not been a Harpagon whose passions had all been\ndevoured by the ever-lean and ever-hungry passion of saving, and who\nwould drive a bargain with his undertaker beforehand. He loved money,\nbut he also loved to spend it in gratifying his peculiar tastes, and\nperhaps he loved it best of all as a means of making others feel his\npower more or less uncomfortably. If any one will here contend that\nthere must have been traits of goodness in old Featherstone, I will not\npresume to deny this; but I must observe that goodness is of a modest\nnature, easily discouraged, and when much privacy, elbowed in early\nlife by unabashed vices, is apt to retire into extreme privacy, so that\nit is more easily believed in by those who construct a selfish old\ngentleman theoretically, than by those who form the narrower judgments\nbased on his personal acquaintance. In any case, he had been bent on\nhaving a handsome funeral, and on having persons “bid” to it who would\nrather have stayed at home. He had even desired that female relatives\nshould follow him to the grave, and poor sister Martha had taken a\ndifficult journey for this purpose from the Chalky Flats. She and Jane\nwould have been altogether cheered (in a tearful manner) by this sign\nthat a brother who disliked seeing them while he was living had been\nprospectively fond of their presence when he should have become a\ntestator, if the sign had not been made equivocal by being extended to\nMrs. Vincy, whose expense in handsome crape seemed to imply the most\npresumptuous hopes, aggravated by a bloom of complexion which told\npretty plainly that she was not a blood-relation, but of that generally\nobjectionable class called wife’s kin."

  "content": "We are all of us imaginative in some form or other, for images are the\nbrood of desire; and poor old Featherstone, who laughed much at the way\nin which others cajoled themselves, did not escape the fellowship of\nillusion. In writing the programme for his burial he certainly did not\nmake clear to himself that his pleasure in the little drama of which it\nformed a part was confined to anticipation. In chuckling over the\nvexations he could inflict by the rigid clutch of his dead hand, he\ninevitably mingled his consciousness with that livid stagnant presence,\nand so far as he was preoccupied with a future life, it was with one of\ngratification inside his coffin. Thus old Featherstone was imaginative,\nafter his fashion."

  "content": "However, the three mourning-coaches were filled according to the\nwritten orders of the deceased. There were pall-bearers on horseback,\nwith the richest scarfs and hatbands, and even the under-bearers had\ntrappings of woe which were of a good well-priced quality. The black\nprocession, when dismounted, looked the larger for the smallness of the\nchurchyard; the heavy human faces and the black draperies shivering in\nthe wind seemed to tell of a world strangely incongruous with the\nlightly dropping blossoms and the gleams of sunshine on the daisies.\nThe clergyman who met the procession was Mr. Cadwallader—also according\nto the request of Peter Featherstone, prompted as usual by peculiar\nreasons. Having a contempt for curates, whom he always called\nunderstrappers, he was resolved to be buried by a beneficed clergyman.\nMr. Casaubon was out of the question, not merely because he declined\nduty of this sort, but because Featherstone had an especial dislike to\nhim as the rector of his own parish, who had a lien on the land in the\nshape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the old\nman, being in his pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit\nthrough with an inward snarl. He had an objection to a parson stuck up\nabove his head preaching to him. But his relations with Mr. Cadwallader\nhad been of a different kind: the trout-stream which ran through Mr.\nCasaubon’s land took its course through Featherstone’s also, so that\nMr. Cadwallader was a parson who had had to ask a favor instead of\npreaching. Moreover, he was one of the high gentry living four miles\naway from Lowick, and was thus exalted to an equal sky with the sheriff\nof the county and other dignities vaguely regarded as necessary to the\nsystem of things. There would be a satisfaction in being buried by Mr.\nCadwallader, whose very name offered a fine opportunity for pronouncing\nwrongly if you liked.This distinction conferred on the Rector of Tipton and Freshitt was the\nreason why Mrs. Cadwallader made one of the group that watched old\nFeatherstone’s funeral from an upper window of the manor. She was not\nfond of visiting that house, but she liked, as she said, to see\ncollections of strange animals such as there would be at this funeral;\nand she had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the\nRector and herself to Lowick in order that the visit might be\naltogether pleasant.“I will go anywhere with you, Mrs. Cadwallader,” Celia had said; “but I\ndon’t like funerals.”“Oh, my dear, when you have a clergyman in your family you must\naccommodate your tastes: I did that very early. When I married Humphrey\nI made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by liking the end very\nmuch. That soon spread to the middle and the beginning, because I\ncouldn’t have the end without them.”“No, to be sure not,” said the Dowager Lady Chettam, with stately\nemphasis.The upper window from which the funeral could be well seen was in the\nroom occupied by Mr. Casaubon when he had been forbidden to work; but\nhe had resumed nearly his habitual style of life now in spite of\nwarnings and prescriptions, and after politely welcoming Mrs.\nCadwallader had slipped again into the library to chew a cud of erudite\nmistake about Cush and Mizraim."

  "content": "But for her visitors Dorothea too might have been shut up in the\nlibrary, and would not have witnessed this scene of old Featherstone’s\nfuneral, which, aloof as it seemed to be from the tenor of her life,\nalways afterwards came back to her at the touch of certain sensitive\npoints in memory, just as the vision of St. Peter’s at Rome was inwoven\nwith moods of despondency. Scenes which make vital changes in our\nneighbors’ lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a\nparticular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for\nus with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity\nwhich lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.The dream-like association of something alien and ill-understood with\nthe deepest secrets of her experience seemed to mirror that sense of\nloneliness which was due to the very ardor of Dorothea’s nature. The\ncountry gentry of old time lived in a rarefied social air: dotted apart\non their stations up the mountain they looked down with imperfect\ndiscrimination on the belts of thicker life below. And Dorothea was not\nat ease in the perspective and chilliness of that height.“I shall not look any more,” said Celia, after the train had entered\nthe church, placing herself a little behind her husband’s elbow so that\nshe could slyly touch his coat with her cheek. “I dare say Dodo likes\nit: she is fond of melancholy things and ugly people.”“I am fond of knowing something about the people I live among,” said\nDorothea, who had been watching everything with the interest of a monk\non his holiday tour. “It seems to me we know nothing of our neighbors,\nunless they are cottagers. One is constantly wondering what sort of\nlives other people lead, and how they take things. I am quite obliged\nto Mrs. Cadwallader for coming and calling me out of the library.”“Quite right to feel obliged to me,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Your rich\nLowick farmers are as curious as any buffaloes or bisons, and I dare\nsay you don’t half see them at church. They are quite different from\nyour uncle’s tenants or Sir James’s—monsters—farmers without\nlandlords—one can’t tell how to class them.”“Most of these followers are not Lowick people,” said Sir James; “I\nsuppose they are legatees from a distance, or from Middlemarch.\nLovegood tells me the old fellow has left a good deal of money as well\nas land.”“Think of that now! when so many younger sons can’t dine at their own\nexpense,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Ah,” turning round at the sound of\nthe opening door, “here is Mr. Brooke. I felt that we were incomplete\nbefore, and here is the explanation. You are come to see this odd\nfuneral, of course?”"

  "content": "“No, I came to look after Casaubon—to see how he goes on, you know. And\nto bring a little news—a little news, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke,\nnodding at Dorothea as she came towards him. “I looked into the\nlibrary, and I saw Casaubon over his books. I told him it wouldn’t do:\nI said, ‘This will never do, you know: think of your wife, Casaubon.’\nAnd he promised me to come up. I didn’t tell him my news: I said, he\nmust come up.”“Ah, now they are coming out of church,” Mrs. Cadwallader exclaimed.\n“Dear me, what a wonderfully mixed set! Mr. Lydgate as doctor, I\nsuppose. But that is really a good looking woman, and the fair young\nman must be her son. Who are they, Sir James, do you know?”“I see Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch; they are probably his wife and\nson,” said Sir James, looking interrogatively at Mr. Brooke, who nodded\nand said—“Yes, a very decent family—a very good fellow is Vincy; a credit to the\nmanufacturing interest. You have seen him at my house, you know.”“Ah, yes: one of your secret committee,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,\nprovokingly.“A coursing fellow, though,” said Sir James, with a fox-hunter’s\ndisgust.“And one of those who suck the life out of the wretched handloom\nweavers in Tipton and Freshitt. That is how his family look so fair and\nsleek,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Those dark, purple-faced people are an\nexcellent foil. Dear me, they are like a set of jugs! Do look at\nHumphrey: one might fancy him an ugly archangel towering above them in\nhis white surplice.”“It’s a solemn thing, though, a funeral,” said Mr. Brooke, “if you take\nit in that light, you know.”“But I am not taking it in that light. I can’t wear my solemnity too\noften, else it will go to rags. It was time the old man died, and none\nof these people are sorry.”“How piteous!” said Dorothea. “This funeral seems to me the most dismal\nthing I ever saw. It is a blot on the morning. I cannot bear to think\nthat any one should die and leave no love behind.”She was going to say more, but she saw her husband enter and seat\nhimself a little in the background. The difference his presence made to\nher was not always a happy one: she felt that he often inwardly\nobjected to her speech.“Positively,” exclaimed Mrs. Cadwallader, “there is a new face come out\nfrom behind that broad man queerer than any of them: a little round\nhead with bulging eyes—a sort of frog-face—do look. He must be of\nanother blood, I think.”"

  "content": "“Let me see!” said Celia, with awakened curiosity, standing behind Mrs.\nCadwallader and leaning forward over her head. “Oh, what an odd face!”\nThen with a quick change to another sort of surprised expression, she\nadded, “Why, Dodo, you never told me that Mr. Ladislaw was come again!”Dorothea felt a shock of alarm: every one noticed her sudden paleness\nas she looked up immediately at her uncle, while Mr. Casaubon looked at\nher.“He came with me, you know; he is my guest—puts up with me at the\nGrange,” said Mr. Brooke, in his easiest tone, nodding at Dorothea, as\nif the announcement were just what she might have expected. “And we\nhave brought the picture at the top of the carriage. I knew you would\nbe pleased with the surprise, Casaubon. There you are to the very\nlife—as Aquinas, you know. Quite the right sort of thing. And you will\nhear young Ladislaw talk about it. He talks uncommonly well—points out\nthis, that, and the other—knows art and everything of that\nkind—companionable, you know—is up with you in any track—what I’ve been\nwanting a long while.”Mr. Casaubon bowed with cold politeness, mastering his irritation, but\nonly so far as to be silent. He remembered Will’s letter quite as well\nas Dorothea did; he had noticed that it was not among the letters which\nhad been reserved for him on his recovery, and secretly concluding that\nDorothea had sent word to Will not to come to Lowick, he had shrunk\nwith proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject. He now\ninferred that she had asked her uncle to invite Will to the Grange; and\nshe felt it impossible at that moment to enter into any explanation.Mrs. Cadwallader’s eyes, diverted from the churchyard, saw a good deal\nof dumb show which was not so intelligible to her as she could have\ndesired, and could not repress the question, “Who is Mr. Ladislaw?”“A young relative of Mr. Casaubon’s,” said Sir James, promptly. His\ngood-nature often made him quick and clear-seeing in personal matters,\nand he had divined from Dorothea’s glance at her husband that there was\nsome alarm in her mind."

I have plenty of\nideas and facts, you know, and I can see he is just the man to put them\ninto shape—remembers what the right quotations are, _omne tulit\npunctum_, and that sort of thing—gives subjects a kind of turn. I\ninvited him some time ago when you were ill, Casaubon; Dorothea said\nyou couldn’t have anybody in the house, you know, and she asked me to\nwrite.”Poor Dorothea felt that every word of her uncle’s was about as pleasant\nas a grain of sand in the eye to Mr. Casaubon. It would be altogether\nunfitting now to explain that she had not wished her uncle to invite\nWill Ladislaw. She could not in the least make clear to herself the\nreasons for her husband’s dislike to his presence—a dislike painfully\nimpressed on her by the scene in the library; but she felt the\nunbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion of it to\nothers. Mr. Casaubon, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those\nmixed reasons to himself; irritated feeling with him, as with all of\nus, seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge. But he\nwished to repress outward signs, and only Dorothea could discern the\nchanges in her husband’s face before he observed with more of dignified\nbending and sing-song than usual—“You are exceedingly hospitable, my dear sir; and I owe you\nacknowledgments for exercising your hospitality towards a relative of\nmine.”The funeral was ended now, and the churchyard was being cleared.“Now you can see him, Mrs. Cadwallader,” said Celia. “He is just like a\nminiature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt that hangs in Dorothea’s boudoir—quite\nnice-looking.”“A very pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, dryly. “What is your\nnephew to be, Mr. Casaubon?”“Pardon me, he is not my nephew. He is my cousin.”“Well, you know,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “he is trying his wings. He is\njust the sort of young fellow to rise. I should be glad to give him an\nopportunity. He would make a good secretary, now, like Hobbes, Milton,\nSwift—that sort of man.”“I understand,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “One who can write speeches.”"

  "content": "The same sort of temptation befell the Christian Carnivora who formed\nPeter Featherstone’s funeral procession; most of them having their\nminds bent on a limited store which each would have liked to get the\nmost of. The long-recognized blood-relations and connections by\nmarriage made already a goodly number, which, multiplied by\npossibilities, presented a fine range for jealous conjecture and\npathetic hopefulness. Jealousy of the Vincys had created a fellowship\nin hostility among all persons of the Featherstone blood, so that in\nthe absence of any decided indication that one of themselves was to\nhave more than the rest, the dread lest that long-legged Fred Vincy\nshould have the land was necessarily dominant, though it left abundant\nfeeling and leisure for vaguer jealousies, such as were entertained\ntowards Mary Garth. Solomon found time to reflect that Jonah was\nundeserving, and Jonah to abuse Solomon as greedy; Jane, the elder\nsister, held that Martha’s children ought not to expect so much as the\nyoung Waules; and Martha, more lax on the subject of primogeniture, was\nsorry to think that Jane was so “having.” These nearest of kin were\nnaturally impressed with the unreasonableness of expectations in\ncousins and second cousins, and used their arithmetic in reckoning the\nlarge sums that small legacies might mount to, if there were too many\nof them. Two cousins were present to hear the will, and a second cousin\nbesides Mr. Trumbull. This second cousin was a Middlemarch mercer of\npolite manners and superfluous aspirates. The two cousins were elderly\nmen from Brassing, one of them conscious of claims on the score of\ninconvenient expense sustained by him in presents of oysters and other\neatables to his rich cousin Peter; the other entirely saturnine,\nleaning his hands and chin on a stick, and conscious of claims based on\nno narrow performance but on merit generally: both blameless citizens\nof Brassing, who wished that Jonah Featherstone did not live there. The\nwit of a family is usually best received among strangers."

  "content": "But in the morning all the ordinary currents of conjecture were\ndisturbed by the presence of a strange mourner who had plashed among\nthem as if from the moon. This was the stranger described by Mrs.\nCadwallader as frog-faced: a man perhaps about two or three and thirty,\nwhose prominent eyes, thin-lipped, downward-curved mouth, and hair\nsleekly brushed away from a forehead that sank suddenly above the ridge\nof the eyebrows, certainly gave his face a batrachian unchangeableness\nof expression. Here, clearly, was a new legatee; else why was he bidden\nas a mourner? Here were new possibilities, raising a new uncertainty,\nwhich almost checked remark in the mourning-coaches. We are all\nhumiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed very\ncomfortably and perhaps been staring at us in private while we have\nbeen making up our world entirely without it. No one had seen this\nquestionable stranger before except Mary Garth, and she knew nothing\nmore of him than that he had twice been to Stone Court when Mr.\nFeatherstone was down-stairs, and had sat alone with him for several\nhours. She had found an opportunity of mentioning this to her father,\nand perhaps Caleb’s were the only eyes, except the lawyer’s, which\nexamined the stranger with more of inquiry than of disgust or\nsuspicion. Caleb Garth, having little expectation and less cupidity,\nwas interested in the verification of his own guesses, and the calmness\nwith which he half smilingly rubbed his chin and shot intelligent\nglances much as if he were valuing a tree, made a fine contrast with\nthe alarm or scorn visible in other faces when the unknown mourner,\nwhose name was understood to be Rigg, entered the wainscoted parlor and\ntook his seat near the door to make part of the audience when the will\nshould be read. Just then Mr. Solomon and Mr. Jonah were gone up-stairs\nwith the lawyer to search for the will; and Mrs. Waule, seeing two\nvacant seats between herself and Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had the spirit\nto move next to that great authority, who was handling his watch-seals\nand trimming his outlines with a determination not to show anything so\ncompromising to a man of ability as wonder or surprise."

  "content": "“I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother’s done, Mr.\nTrumbull,” said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of her woolly tones, while\nshe turned her crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr. Trumbull’s ear.“My good lady, whatever was told me was told in confidence,” said the\nauctioneer, putting his hand up to screen that secret.“Them who’ve made sure of their good-luck may be disappointed yet,”\nMrs. Waule continued, finding some relief in this communication.“Hopes are often delusive,” said Mr. Trumbull, still in confidence.“Ah!” said Mrs. Waule, looking across at the Vincys, and then moving\nback to the side of her sister Martha.“It’s wonderful how close poor Peter was,” she said, in the same\nundertones. “We none of us know what he might have had on his mind. I\nonly hope and trust he wasn’t a worse liver than we think of, Martha.”Poor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had the\nadditional motive for making her remarks unexceptionable and giving\nthem a general bearing, that even her whispers were loud and liable to\nsudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ.“I never _was_ covetous, Jane,” she replied; “but I have six children\nand have buried three, and I didn’t marry into money. The eldest, that\nsits there, is but nineteen—so I leave you to guess. And stock always\nshort, and land most awkward. But if ever I’ve begged and prayed; it’s\nbeen to God above; though where there’s one brother a bachelor and the\nother childless after twice marrying—anybody might think!”"

I should be all the better\npleased if he’d left lots of small legacies. They may be uncommonly\nuseful to fellows in a small way.”“Everything is as handsome as could be, crape and silk and everything,”\nsaid Mrs. Vincy, contentedly.But I am sorry to say that Fred was under some difficulty in repressing\na laugh, which would have been more unsuitable than his father’s\nsnuff-box. Fred had overheard Mr. Jonah suggesting something about a\n“love-child,” and with this thought in his mind, the stranger’s face,\nwhich happened to be opposite him, affected him too ludicrously. Mary\nGarth, discerning his distress in the twitchings of his mouth, and his\nrecourse to a cough, came cleverly to his rescue by asking him to\nchange seats with her, so that he got into a shadowy corner. Fred was\nfeeling as good-naturedly as possible towards everybody, including\nRigg; and having some relenting towards all these people who were less\nlucky than he was aware of being himself, he would not for the world\nhave behaved amiss; still, it was particularly easy to laugh.But the entrance of the lawyer and the two brothers drew every one’s\nattention. The lawyer was Mr. Standish, and he had come to Stone Court\nthis morning believing that he knew thoroughly well who would be\npleased and who disappointed before the day was over. The will he\nexpected to read was the last of three which he had drawn up for Mr.\nFeatherstone. Mr. Standish was not a man who varied his manners: he\nbehaved with the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to everybody, as\nif he saw no difference in them, and talked chiefly of the hay-crop,\nwhich would be “very fine, by God!” of the last bulletins concerning\nthe King, and of the Duke of Clarence, who was a sailor every inch of\nhim, and just the man to rule over an island like Britain."

  "content": "Old Featherstone had often reflected as he sat looking at the fire that\nStandish would be surprised some day: it is true that if he had done as\nhe liked at the last, and burnt the will drawn up by another lawyer, he\nwould not have secured that minor end; still he had had his pleasure in\nruminating on it. And certainly Mr. Standish was surprised, but not at\nall sorry; on the contrary, he rather enjoyed the zest of a little\ncuriosity in his own mind, which the discovery of a second will added\nto the prospective amazement on the part of the Featherstone family.As to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, they were held in utter\nsuspense: it seemed to them that the old will would have a certain\nvalidity, and that there might be such an interlacement of poor Peter’s\nformer and latter intentions as to create endless “lawing” before\nanybody came by their own—an inconvenience which would have at least\nthe advantage of going all round. Hence the brothers showed a\nthoroughly neutral gravity as they re-entered with Mr. Standish; but\nSolomon took out his white handkerchief again with a sense that in any\ncase there would be affecting passages, and crying at funerals, however\ndry, was customarily served up in lawn.Perhaps the person who felt the most throbbing excitement at this\nmoment was Mary Garth, in the consciousness that it was she who had\nvirtually determined the production of this second will, which might\nhave momentous effects on the lot of some persons present. No soul\nexcept herself knew what had passed on that final night.“The will I hold in my hand,” said Mr. Standish, who, seated at the\ntable in the middle of the room, took his time about everything,\nincluding the coughs with which he showed a disposition to clear his\nvoice, “was drawn up by myself and executed by our deceased friend on\nthe 9th of August, 1825. But I find that there is a subsequent\ninstrument hitherto unknown to me, bearing date the 20th of July, 1826,\nhardly a year later than the previous one. And there is farther, I\nsee”—Mr. Standish was cautiously travelling over the document with his\nspectacles—“a codicil to this latter will, bearing date March 1, 1828.”“Dear, dear!” said sister Martha, not meaning to be audible, but driven\nto some articulation under this pressure of dates.“I shall begin by reading the earlier will,” continued Mr. Standish,\n“since such, as appears by his not having destroyed the document, was\nthe intention of deceased.”"

And at the sound of the first “give and\nbequeath” she could see all complexions changing subtly, as if some\nfaint vibration were passing through them, save that of Mr. Rigg. He\nsat in unaltered calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more\nimportant problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests\nwhich might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him. Fred\nblushed, and Mr. Vincy found it impossible to do without his snuff-box\nin his hand, though he kept it closed."

One likes to be done well\nby in every tense, past, present, and future. And here was Peter\ncapable five years ago of leaving only two hundred apiece to his own\nbrothers and sisters, and only a hundred apiece to his own nephews and\nnieces: the Garths were not mentioned, but Mrs. Vincy and Rosamond were\neach to have a hundred. Mr. Trumbull was to have the gold-headed cane\nand fifty pounds; the other second cousins and the cousins present were\neach to have the like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin\nobserved, was a sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was\nmuch more of such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not\npresent—problematical, and, it was to be feared, low connections.\nAltogether, reckoning hastily, here were about three thousand disposed\nof. Where then had Peter meant the rest of the money to go—and where\nthe land? and what was revoked and what not revoked—and was the\nrevocation for better or for worse? All emotion must be conditional,\nand might turn out to be the wrong thing. The men were strong enough to\nbear up and keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting their\nlower lip fall, others pursing it up, according to the habit of their\nmuscles. But Jane and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and\nbegan to cry; poor Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of\ngetting any hundreds at all without working for them, and half aware\nthat her share was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule’s mind was entirely\nflooded with the sense of being an own sister and getting little, while\nsomebody else was to have much. The general expectation now was that\nthe “much” would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves were\nsurprised when ten thousand pounds in specified investments were\ndeclared to be bequeathed to him:—was the land coming too? Fred bit his\nlips: it was difficult to help smiling, and Mrs. Vincy felt herself the\nhappiest of women—possible revocation shrinking out of sight in this\ndazzling vision."

O endless\nvocatives that would still leave expression slipping helpless from the\nmeasurement of mortal folly!—that residuary legatee was Joshua Rigg,\nwho was also sole executor, and who was to take thenceforth the name of\nFeatherstone.There was a rustling which seemed like a shudder running round the\nroom. Every one stared afresh at Mr. Rigg, who apparently experienced\nno surprise.“A most singular testamentary disposition!” exclaimed Mr. Trumbull,\npreferring for once that he should be considered ignorant in the past.\n“But there is a second will—there is a further document. We have not\nyet heard the final wishes of the deceased.”Mary Garth was feeling that what they had yet to hear were not the\nfinal wishes. The second will revoked everything except the legacies to\nthe low persons before mentioned (some alterations in these being the\noccasion of the codicil), and the bequest of all the land lying in\nLowick parish with all the stock and household furniture, to Joshua\nRigg. The residue of the property was to be devoted to the erection and\nendowment of almshouses for old men, to be called Featherstone’s\nAlms-Houses, and to be built on a piece of land near Middlemarch\nalready bought for the purpose by the testator, he wishing—so the\ndocument declared—to please God Almighty. Nobody present had a\nfarthing; but Mr. Trumbull had the gold-headed cane. It took some time\nfor the company to recover the power of expression. Mary dared not look\nat Fred."

I should say he was not in his right\nmind when he made it. I should say this last will was void,” added Mr.\nVincy, feeling that this expression put the thing in the true light.\n“Eh Standish?”“Our deceased friend always knew what he was about, I think,” said Mr.\nStandish. “Everything is quite regular. Here is a letter from Clemmens\nof Brassing tied with the will. He drew it up. A very respectable\nsolicitor.”“I never noticed any alienation of mind—any aberration of intellect in\nthe late Mr. Featherstone,” said Borthrop Trumbull, “but I call this\nwill eccentric. I was always willingly of service to the old soul; and\nhe intimated pretty plainly a sense of obligation which would show\nitself in his will. The gold-headed cane is farcical considered as an\nacknowledgment to me; but happily I am above mercenary considerations.”“There’s nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see,” said\nCaleb Garth. “Anybody might have had more reason for wondering if the\nwill had been what you might expect from an open-minded straightforward\nman. For my part, I wish there was no such thing as a will.”“That’s a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man, by God!” said\nthe lawyer. “I should like to know how you will back that up, Garth!”“Oh,” said Caleb, leaning forward, adjusting his finger-tips with\nnicety and looking meditatively on the ground. It always seemed to him\nthat words were the hardest part of “business.”But here Mr. Jonah Featherstone made himself heard. “Well, he always\nwas a fine hypocrite, was my brother Peter. But this will cuts out\neverything. If I’d known, a wagon and six horses shouldn’t have drawn\nme from Brassing. I’ll put a white hat and drab coat on to-morrow.”“Dear, dear,” wept Mrs. Cranch, “and we’ve been at the expense of\ntravelling, and that poor lad sitting idle here so long! It’s the first\ntime I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to please God\nAlmighty; but if I was to be struck helpless I must say it’s hard—I can\nthink no other.”"

And me—the trouble I’ve\nbeen at, times and times, to come here and be sisterly—and him with\nthings on his mind all the while that might make anybody’s flesh creep.\nBut if the Almighty’s allowed it, he means to punish him for it.\nBrother Solomon, I shall be going, if you’ll drive me.”“I’ve no desire to put my foot on the premises again,” said Solomon.\n“I’ve got land of my own and property of my own to will away.”“It’s a poor tale how luck goes in the world,” said Jonah. “It never\nanswers to have a bit of spirit in you. You’d better be a dog in the\nmanger. But those above ground might learn a lesson. One fool’s will is\nenough in a family.”“There’s more ways than one of being a fool,” said Solomon. “I shan’t\nleave my money to be poured down the sink, and I shan’t leave it to\nfoundlings from Africay. I like Featherstones that were brewed such,\nand not turned Featherstones with sticking the name on ’em.”Solomon addressed these remarks in a loud aside to Mrs. Waule as he\nrose to accompany her. Brother Jonah felt himself capable of much more\nstinging wit than this, but he reflected that there was no use in\noffending the new proprietor of Stone Court, until you were certain\nthat he was quite without intentions of hospitality towards witty men\nwhose name he was about to bear."

He had\na high chirping voice and a vile accent. Fred, whom he no longer moved\nto laughter, thought him the lowest monster he had ever seen. But Fred\nwas feeling rather sick. The Middlemarch mercer waited for an\nopportunity of engaging Mr. Rigg in conversation: there was no knowing\nhow many pairs of legs the new proprietor might require hose for, and\nprofits were more to be relied on than legacies. Also, the mercer, as a\nsecond cousin, was dispassionate enough to feel curiosity.Mr. Vincy, after his one outburst, had remained proudly silent, though\ntoo much preoccupied with unpleasant feelings to think of moving, till\nhe observed that his wife had gone to Fred’s side and was crying\nsilently while she held her darling’s hand. He rose immediately, and\nturning his back on the company while he said to her in an\nundertone,—“Don’t give way, Lucy; don’t make a fool of yourself, my\ndear, before these people,” he added in his usual loud voice—“Go and\norder the phaeton, Fred; I have no time to waste.”Mary Garth had before this been getting ready to go home with her\nfather. She met Fred in the hall, and now for the first time had the\ncourage to look at him. He had that withered sort of paleness which\nwill sometimes come on young faces, and his hand was very cold when she\nshook it.

I do\nbelieve you are better without the money. What was the good of it to\nMr. Featherstone?”“That’s all very fine,” said Fred, pettishly. “What is a fellow to do?\nI must go into the Church now.” (He knew that this would vex Mary: very\nwell; then she must tell him what else he could do.) “And I thought I\nshould be able to pay your father at once and make everything right.\nAnd you have not even a hundred pounds left you. What shall you do now,\nMary?”“Take another situation, of course, as soon as I can get one. My father\nhas enough to do to keep the rest, without me. Good-by.”"
