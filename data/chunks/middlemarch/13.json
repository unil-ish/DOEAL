  "content": "“Why, Tom, _you_ don’t wear such gentlemanly trousers—you haven’t got\nhalf such fine long legs,” said Jonah to his nephew, winking at the\nsame time, to imply that there was something more in these statements\nthan their undeniableness. Tom looked at his legs, but left it\nuncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious\nlength of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser.In the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes\non the watch, and own relatives eager to be “sitters-up.” Many came,\nlunched, and departed, but Brother Solomon and the lady who had been\nJane Featherstone for twenty-five years before she was Mrs. Waule found\nit good to be there every day for hours, without other calculable\noccupation than that of observing the cunning Mary Garth (who was so\ndeep that she could be found out in nothing) and giving occasional dry\nwrinkly indications of crying—as if capable of torrents in a wetter\nseason—at the thought that they were not allowed to go into Mr.\nFeatherstone’s room. For the old man’s dislike of his own family seemed\nto get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting\nthings to them. Too languid to sting, he had the more venom refluent in\nhis blood.Not fully believing the message sent through Mary Garth, they had\npresented themselves together within the door of the bedroom, both in\nblack—Mrs. Waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her\nhand—and both with faces in a sort of half-mourning purple; while Mrs.\nVincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually\nadministering a cordial to their own brother, and the\nlight-complexioned Fred, his short hair curling as might be expected in\na gambler’s, was lolling at his ease in a large chair.Old Featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures\nappearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more\nsuccessfully than the cordial. He was propped up on a bed-rest, and\nalways had his gold-headed stick lying by him. He seized it now and\nswept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could,\napparently to ban these ugly spectres, crying in a hoarse sort of\nscreech—“Back, back, Mrs. Waule! Back, Solomon!”"

  "content": "“Oh, Brother. Peter,” Mrs. Waule began—but Solomon put his hand before\nher repressingly. He was a large-cheeked man, nearly seventy, with\nsmall furtive eyes, and was not only of much blander temper but thought\nhimself much deeper than his brother Peter; indeed not likely to be\ndeceived in any of his fellow-men, inasmuch as they could not well be\nmore greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being. Even the\ninvisible powers, he thought, were likely to be soothed by a bland\nparenthesis here and there—coming from a man of property, who might\nhave been as impious as others.“Brother Peter,” he said, in a wheedling yet gravely official tone,\n“It’s nothing but right I should speak to you about the Three Crofts\nand the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I’ve got on my mind—”“Then he knows more than I want to know,” said Peter, laying down his\nstick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too, for he\nreversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of\ncloser fighting, and looked hard at Solomon’s bald head.“There’s things you might repent of, Brother, for want of speaking to\nme,” said Solomon, not advancing, however. “I could sit up with you\nto-night, and Jane with me, willingly, and you might take your own time\nto speak, or let me speak.”“Yes, I shall take my own time—you needn’t offer me yours,” said Peter.“But you can’t take your own time to die in, Brother,” began Mrs.\nWaule, with her usual woolly tone. “And when you lie speechless you may\nbe tired of having strangers about you, and you may think of me and my\nchildren”—but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she\nwas attributing to her speechless brother; the mention of ourselves\nbeing naturally affecting.“No, I shan’t,” said old Featherstone, contradictiously. “I shan’t\nthink of any of you. I’ve made my will, I tell you, I’ve made my will.”\nHere he turned his head towards Mrs. Vincy, and swallowed some more of\nhis cordial.“Some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to\nothers,” said Mrs. Waule, turning her narrow eyes in the same\ndirection.“Oh, sister,” said Solomon, with ironical softness, “you and me are not\nfine, and handsome, and clever enough: we must be humble and let smart\npeople push themselves before us.”Fred’s spirit could not bear this: rising and looking at Mr.\nFeatherstone, he said, “Shall my mother and I leave the room, sir, that\nyou may be alone with your friends?”"

  "content": "“Sit down, I tell you,” said old Featherstone, snappishly. “Stop where\nyou are. Good-by, Solomon,” he added, trying to wield his stick again,\nbut failing now that he had reversed the handle. “Good-by, Mrs. Waule.\nDon’t you come again.”“I shall be down-stairs, Brother, whether or no,” said Solomon. “I\nshall do my duty, and it remains to be seen what the Almighty will\nallow.”“Yes, in property going out of families,” said Mrs. Waule, in\ncontinuation,—“and where there’s steady young men to carry on. But I\npity them who are not such, and I pity their mothers. Good-by, Brother\nPeter.”“Remember, I’m the eldest after you, Brother, and prospered from the\nfirst, just as you did, and have got land already by the name of\nFeatherstone,” said Solomon, relying much on that reflection, as one\nwhich might be suggested in the watches of the night. “But I bid you\ngood-by for the present.”Their exit was hastened by their seeing old Mr. Featherstone pull his\nwig on each side and shut his eyes with his mouth-widening grimace, as\nif he were determined to be deaf and blind.None the less they came to Stone Court daily and sat below at the post\nof duty, sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an undertone in which\nthe observation and response were so far apart, that any one hearing\nthem might have imagined himself listening to speaking automata, in\nsome doubt whether the ingenious mechanism would really work, or wind\nitself up for a long time in order to stick and be silent. Solomon and\nJane would have been sorry to be quick: what that led to might be seen\non the other side of the wall in the person of Brother Jonah."

  "content": "But their watch in the wainscoted parlor was sometimes varied by the\npresence of other guests from far or near. Now that Peter Featherstone\nwas up-stairs, his property could be discussed with all that local\nenlightenment to be found on the spot: some rural and Middlemarch\nneighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with\ntheir interest against the Vincys, and feminine visitors were even\nmoved to tears, in conversation with Mrs. Waule, when they recalled the\nfact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by\ncodicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly\ngentlemen, who, it might have been supposed, had been spared for\nsomething better. Such conversation paused suddenly, like an organ when\nthe bellows are let drop, if Mary Garth came into the room; and all\neyes were turned on her as a possible legatee, or one who might get\naccess to iron chests.But the younger men who were relatives or connections of the family,\nwere disposed to admire her in this problematic light, as a girl who\nshowed much conduct, and who among all the chances that were flying\nmight turn out to be at least a moderate prize. Hence she had her share\nof compliments and polite attentions."

  "content": "Especially from Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, a distinguished bachelor and\nauctioneer of those parts, much concerned in the sale of land and\ncattle: a public character, indeed, whose name was seen on widely\ndistributed placards, and who might reasonably be sorry for those who\ndid not know of him. He was second cousin to Peter Featherstone, and\nhad been treated by him with more amenity than any other relative,\nbeing useful in matters of business; and in that programme of his\nfuneral which the old man had himself dictated, he had been named as a\nBearer. There was no odious cupidity in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull—nothing\nmore than a sincere sense of his own merit, which, he was aware, in\ncase of rivalry might tell against competitors; so that if Peter\nFeatherstone, who so far as he, Trumbull, was concerned, had behaved\nlike as good a soul as ever breathed, should have done anything\nhandsome by him, all he could say was, that he had never fished and\nfawned, but had advised him to the best of his experience, which now\nextended over twenty years from the time of his apprenticeship at\nfifteen, and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind.\nHis admiration was far from being confined to himself, but was\naccustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating\nthings at a high rate. He was an amateur of superior phrases, and never\nused poor language without immediately correcting himself—which was\nfortunate, as he was rather loud, and given to predominate, standing or\nwalking about frequently, pulling down his waistcoat with the air of a\nman who is very much of his own opinion, trimming himself rapidly with\nhis fore-finger, and marking each new series in these movements by a\nbusy play with his large seals. There was occasionally a little\nfierceness in his demeanor, but it was directed chiefly against false\nopinion, of which there is so much to correct in the world that a man\nof some reading and experience necessarily has his patience tried. He\nfelt that the Featherstone family generally was of limited\nunderstanding, but being a man of the world and a public character,\ntook everything as a matter of course, and even went to converse with\nMr. Jonah and young Cranch in the kitchen, not doubting that he had\nimpressed the latter greatly by his leading questions concerning the\nChalky Flats. If anybody had observed that Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, being\nan auctioneer, was bound to know the nature of everything, he would\nhave smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came\npretty near that. On the whole, in an auctioneering way, he was an\nhonorable man, not ashamed of his business, and feeling that “the\ncelebrated Peel, now Sir Robert,” if introduced to him, would not fail\nto recognize his importance."

  "content": "“I don’t mind if I have a slice of that ham, and a glass of that ale,\nMiss Garth, if you will allow me,” he said, coming into the parlor at\nhalf-past eleven, after having had the exceptional privilege of seeing\nold Featherstone, and standing with his back to the fire between Mrs.\nWaule and Solomon.“It’s not necessary for you to go out;—let me ring the bell.”“Thank you,” said Mary, “I have an errand.”“Well, Mr. Trumbull, you’re highly favored,” said Mrs. Waule.“What! seeing the old man?” said the auctioneer, playing with his seals\ndispassionately. “Ah, you see he has relied on me considerably.” Here\nhe pressed his lips together, and frowned meditatively.“Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?” said Solomon,\nin a soft tone of humility, in which he had a sense of luxurious\ncunning, he being a rich man and not in need of it.“Oh yes, anybody may ask,” said Mr. Trumbull, with loud and\ngood-humored though cutting sarcasm. “Anybody may interrogate. Any one\nmay give their remarks an interrogative turn,” he continued, his\nsonorousness rising with his style. “This is constantly done by good\nspeakers, even when they anticipate no answer. It is what we call a\nfigure of speech—speech at a high figure, as one may say.” The eloquent\nauctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity.“I shouldn’t be sorry to hear he’d remembered you, Mr. Trumbull,” said\nSolomon. “I never was against the deserving. It’s the undeserving I’m\nagainst.”“Ah, there it is, you see, there it is,” said Mr. Trumbull,\nsignificantly. “It can’t be denied that undeserving people have been\nlegatees, and even residuary legatees. It is so, with testamentary\ndispositions.” Again he pursed up his lips and frowned a little.“Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother has left\nhis land away from our family?” said Mrs. Waule, on whom, as an\nunhopeful woman, those long words had a depressing effect."

  "content": "“A man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as leave\nit to some people,” observed Solomon, his sister’s question having\ndrawn no answer.“What, Blue-Coat land?” said Mrs. Waule, again. “Oh, Mr. Trumbull, you\nnever can mean to say that. It would be flying in the face of the\nAlmighty that’s prospered him.”While Mrs. Waule was speaking, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull walked away from\nthe fireplace towards the window, patrolling with his fore-finger round\nthe inside of his stock, then along his whiskers and the curves of his\nhair. He now walked to Miss Garth’s work-table, opened a book which lay\nthere and read the title aloud with pompous emphasis as if he were\noffering it for sale:“‘Anne of Geierstein’ (pronounced Jeersteen) or the ‘Maiden of the\nMist, by the author of Waverley.’” Then turning the page, he began\nsonorously—“The course of four centuries has well-nigh elapsed since\nthe series of events which are related in the following chapters took\nplace on the Continent.” He pronounced the last truly admirable word\nwith the accent on the last syllable, not as unaware of vulgar usage,\nbut feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the sonorous beauty which\nhis reading had given to the whole.And now the servant came in with the tray, so that the moments for\nanswering Mrs. Waule’s question had gone by safely, while she and\nSolomon, watching Mr. Trumbull’s movements, were thinking that high\nlearning interfered sadly with serious affairs. Mr. Borthrop Trumbull\nreally knew nothing about old Featherstone’s will; but he could hardly\nhave been brought to declare any ignorance unless he had been arrested\nfor misprision of treason.“I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale,” he said,\nreassuringly. “As a man with public business, I take a snack when I\ncan. I will back this ham,” he added, after swallowing some morsels\nwith alarming haste, “against any ham in the three kingdoms. In my\nopinion it is better than the hams at Freshitt Hall—and I think I am a\ntolerable judge.”“Some don’t like so much sugar in their hams,” said Mrs. Waule. “But my\npoor brother would always have sugar.”"

  "content": "“If any person demands better, he is at liberty to do so; but, God\nbless me, what an aroma! I should be glad to buy in that quality, I\nknow. There is some gratification to a gentleman”—here Mr. Trumbull’s\nvoice conveyed an emotional remonstrance—“in having this kind of ham\nset on his table.”He pushed aside his plate, poured out his glass of ale and drew his\nchair a little forward, profiting by the occasion to look at the inner\nside of his legs, which he stroked approvingly—Mr. Trumbull having all\nthose less frivolous airs and gestures which distinguish the\npredominant races of the north.“You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,” he observed,\nwhen Mary re-entered. “It is by the author of ‘Waverley’: that is Sir\nWalter Scott. I have bought one of his works myself—a very nice thing,\na very superior publication, entitled ‘Ivanhoe.’ You will not get any\nwriter to beat him in a hurry, I think—he will not, in my opinion, be\nspeedily surpassed. I have just been reading a portion at the\ncommencement of ‘Anne of Jeersteen.’ It commences well.” (Things never\nbegan with Mr. Borthrop Trumbull: they always commenced, both in\nprivate life and on his handbills.) “You are a reader, I see. Do you\nsubscribe to our Middlemarch library?”“No,” said Mary. “Mr. Fred Vincy brought this book.”“I am a great bookman myself,” returned Mr. Trumbull. “I have no less\nthan two hundred volumes in calf, and I flatter myself they are well\nselected. Also pictures by Murillo, Rubens, Teniers, Titian, Vandyck,\nand others. I shall be happy to lend you any work you like to mention,\nMiss Garth.”“I am much obliged,” said Mary, hastening away again, “but I have\nlittle time for reading.”“I should say my brother has done something for _her_ in his will,”\nsaid Mr. Solomon, in a very low undertone, when she had shut the door\nbehind her, pointing with his head towards the absent Mary.“His first wife was a poor match for him, though,” said Mrs. Waule.\n“She brought him nothing: and this young woman is only her niece,—and\nvery proud. And my brother has always paid her wage.”"

  "content": "“A sensible girl though, in my opinion,” said Mr. Trumbull, finishing\nhis ale and starting up with an emphatic adjustment of his waistcoat.\n“I have observed her when she has been mixing medicine in drops. She\nminds what she is doing, sir. That is a great point in a woman, and a\ngreat point for our friend up-stairs, poor dear old soul. A man whose\nlife is of any value should think of his wife as a nurse: that is what\nI should do, if I married; and I believe I have lived single long\nenough not to make a mistake in that line. Some men must marry to\nelevate themselves a little, but when I am in need of that, I hope some\none will tell me so—I hope some individual will apprise me of the fact.\nI wish you good morning, Mrs. Waule. Good morning, Mr. Solomon. I trust\nwe shall meet under less melancholy auspices.”When Mr. Trumbull had departed with a fine bow, Solomon, leaning\nforward, observed to his sister, “You may depend, Jane, my brother has\nleft that girl a lumping sum.”“Anybody would think so, from the way Mr. Trumbull talks,” said Jane.\nThen, after a pause, “He talks as if my daughters wasn’t to be trusted\nto give drops.”“Auctioneers talk wild,” said Solomon. “Not but what Trumbull has made\nmoney.”CHAPTER XXXIII.“Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;\nAnd let us all to meditation.”\n—2 _Henry VI_.That night after twelve o’clock Mary Garth relieved the watch in Mr.\nFeatherstone’s room, and sat there alone through the small hours. She\noften chose this task, in which she found some pleasure,\nnotwithstanding the old man’s testiness whenever he demanded her\nattentions. There were intervals in which she could sit perfectly\nstill, enjoying the outer stillness and the subdued light. The red fire\nwith its gently audible movement seemed like a solemn existence calmly\nindependent of the petty passions, the imbecile desires, the straining\nafter worthless uncertainties, which were daily moving her contempt.\nMary was fond of her own thoughts, and could amuse herself well sitting\nin twilight with her hands in her lap; for, having early had strong\nreason to believe that things were not likely to be arranged for her\npeculiar satisfaction, she wasted no time in astonishment and annoyance\nat that fact. And she had already come to take life very much as a\ncomedy in which she had a proud, nay, a generous resolution not to act\nthe mean or treacherous part. Mary might have become cynical if she had\nnot had parents whom she honored, and a well of affectionate gratitude\nwithin her, which was all the fuller because she had learned to make no\nunreasonable claims."

  "content": "She sat to-night revolving, as she was wont, the scenes of the day, her\nlips often curling with amusement at the oddities to which her fancy\nadded fresh drollery: people were so ridiculous with their illusions,\ncarrying their fool’s caps unawares, thinking their own lies opaque\nwhile everybody else’s were transparent, making themselves exceptions\nto everything, as if when all the world looked yellow under a lamp they\nalone were rosy. Yet there were some illusions under Mary’s eyes which\nwere not quite comic to her. She was secretly convinced, though she had\nno other grounds than her close observation of old Featherstone’s\nnature, that in spite of his fondness for having the Vincys about him,\nthey were as likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom he\nkept at a distance. She had a good deal of disdain for Mrs. Vincy’s\nevident alarm lest she and Fred should be alone together, but it did\nnot hinder her from thinking anxiously of the way in which Fred would\nbe affected, if it should turn out that his uncle had left him as poor\nas ever. She could make a butt of Fred when he was present, but she did\nnot enjoy his follies when he was absent.Yet she liked her thoughts: a vigorous young mind not overbalanced by\npassion, finds a good in making acquaintance with life, and watches its\nown powers with interest. Mary had plenty of merriment within.Her thought was not veined by any solemnity or pathos about the old man\non the bed: such sentiments are easier to affect than to feel about an\naged creature whose life is not visibly anything but a remnant of\nvices. She had always seen the most disagreeable side of Mr.\nFeatherstone: he was not proud of her, and she was only useful to him.\nTo be anxious about a soul that is always snapping at you must be left\nto the saints of the earth; and Mary was not one of them. She had never\nreturned him a harsh word, and had waited on him faithfully: that was\nher utmost. Old Featherstone himself was not in the least anxious about\nhis soul, and had declined to see Mr. Tucker on the subject.To-night he had not snapped, and for the first hour or two he lay\nremarkably still, until at last Mary heard him rattling his bunch of\nkeys against the tin box which he always kept in the bed beside him.\nAbout three o’clock he said, with remarkable distinctness, “Missy, come\nhere!”Mary obeyed, and found that he had already drawn the tin box from under\nthe clothes, though he usually asked to have this done for him; and he\nhad selected the key. He now unlocked the box, and, drawing from it\nanother key, looked straight at her with eyes that seemed to have\nrecovered all their sharpness and said, “How many of ’em are in the\nhouse?”“You mean of your own relations, sir,” said Mary, well used to the old\nman’s way of speech. He nodded slightly and she went on.“Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch are sleeping here.”“Oh ay, they stick, do they? and the rest—they come every day, I’ll\nwarrant—Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns? They come peeping, and\ncounting and casting up?”“Not all of them every day. Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule are here every\nday, and the others come often.”"

And I’ve made everything ready to change my mind, and\ndo as I like at the last. Do you hear, missy? I’ve got my faculties.”“Well, sir?” said Mary, quietly.He now lowered his tone with an air of deeper cunning. “I’ve made two\nwills, and I’m going to burn one. Now you do as I tell you. This is the\nkey of my iron chest, in the closet there. You push well at the side of\nthe brass plate at the top, till it goes like a bolt: then you can put\nthe key in the front lock and turn it. See and do that; and take out\nthe topmost paper—Last Will and Testament—big printed.”“No, sir,” said Mary, in a firm voice, “I cannot do that.”“Not do it? I tell you, you must,” said the old man, his voice\nbeginning to shake under the shock of this resistance.“I cannot touch your iron chest or your will. I must refuse to do\nanything that might lay me open to suspicion.”“I tell you, I’m in my right mind. Shan’t I do as I like at the last? I\nmade two wills on purpose. Take the key, I say.”“No, sir, I will not,” said Mary, more resolutely still. Her repulsion\nwas getting stronger.“I tell you, there’s no time to lose.”“I cannot help that, sir. I will not let the close of your life soil\nthe beginning of mine. I will not touch your iron chest or your will.”\nShe moved to a little distance from the bedside.The old man paused with a blank stare for a little while, holding the\none key erect on the ring; then with an agitated jerk he began to work\nwith his bony left hand at emptying the tin box before him.“Missy,” he began to say, hurriedly, “look here! take the money—the\nnotes and gold—look here—take it—you shall have it all—do as I tell\nyou.”He made an effort to stretch out the key towards her as far as\npossible, and Mary again retreated.“I will not touch your key or your money, sir.

Presently he rallied and said eagerly—“Look here, then. Call the young chap. Call Fred Vincy.”Mary’s heart began to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed through\nher mind as to what the burning of a second will might imply. She had\nto make a difficult decision in a hurry.“I will call him, if you will let me call Mr. Jonah and others with\nhim.”“Nobody else, I say. The young chap.

She never forgot\nthat vision of a man wanting to do as he liked at the last.

If she went\nnear him the irritation might be kept up. He had said nothing after\nthrowing the stick, but she had seen him taking his keys again and\nlaying his right hand on the money. He did not put it up, however, and\nshe thought that he was dropping off to sleep.But Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what\nshe had gone through, than she had been by the reality—questioning\nthose acts of hers which had come imperatively and excluded all\nquestion in the critical moment.Presently the dry wood sent out a flame which illuminated every\ncrevice, and Mary saw that the old man was lying quietly with his head\nturned a little on one side. She went towards him with inaudible steps,\nand thought that his face looked strangely motionless; but the next\nmoment the movement of the flame communicating itself to all objects\nmade her uncertain. The violent beating of her heart rendered her\nperceptions so doubtful that even when she touched him and listened for\nhis breathing, she could not trust her conclusions. She went to the\nwindow and gently propped aside the curtain and blind, so that the\nstill light of the sky fell on the bed."

  "content": "It was on a morning of May that Peter Featherstone was buried. In the\nprosaic neighborhood of Middlemarch, May was not always warm and sunny,\nand on this particular morning a chill wind was blowing the blossoms\nfrom the surrounding gardens on to the green mounds of Lowick\nchurchyard. Swiftly moving clouds only now and then allowed a gleam to\nlight up any object, whether ugly or beautiful, that happened to stand\nwithin its golden shower. In the churchyard the objects were remarkably\nvarious, for there was a little country crowd waiting to see the\nfuneral. The news had spread that it was to be a “big burying;” the old\ngentleman had left written directions about everything and meant to\nhave a funeral “beyond his betters.” This was true; for old\nFeatherstone had not been a Harpagon whose passions had all been\ndevoured by the ever-lean and ever-hungry passion of saving, and who\nwould drive a bargain with his undertaker beforehand. He loved money,\nbut he also loved to spend it in gratifying his peculiar tastes, and\nperhaps he loved it best of all as a means of making others feel his\npower more or less uncomfortably. If any one will here contend that\nthere must have been traits of goodness in old Featherstone, I will not\npresume to deny this; but I must observe that goodness is of a modest\nnature, easily discouraged, and when much privacy, elbowed in early\nlife by unabashed vices, is apt to retire into extreme privacy, so that\nit is more easily believed in by those who construct a selfish old\ngentleman theoretically, than by those who form the narrower judgments\nbased on his personal acquaintance. In any case, he had been bent on\nhaving a handsome funeral, and on having persons “bid” to it who would\nrather have stayed at home. He had even desired that female relatives\nshould follow him to the grave, and poor sister Martha had taken a\ndifficult journey for this purpose from the Chalky Flats. She and Jane\nwould have been altogether cheered (in a tearful manner) by this sign\nthat a brother who disliked seeing them while he was living had been\nprospectively fond of their presence when he should have become a\ntestator, if the sign had not been made equivocal by being extended to\nMrs. Vincy, whose expense in handsome crape seemed to imply the most\npresumptuous hopes, aggravated by a bloom of complexion which told\npretty plainly that she was not a blood-relation, but of that generally\nobjectionable class called wife’s kin."

  "content": "We are all of us imaginative in some form or other, for images are the\nbrood of desire; and poor old Featherstone, who laughed much at the way\nin which others cajoled themselves, did not escape the fellowship of\nillusion. In writing the programme for his burial he certainly did not\nmake clear to himself that his pleasure in the little drama of which it\nformed a part was confined to anticipation. In chuckling over the\nvexations he could inflict by the rigid clutch of his dead hand, he\ninevitably mingled his consciousness with that livid stagnant presence,\nand so far as he was preoccupied with a future life, it was with one of\ngratification inside his coffin. Thus old Featherstone was imaginative,\nafter his fashion."

  "content": "However, the three mourning-coaches were filled according to the\nwritten orders of the deceased. There were pall-bearers on horseback,\nwith the richest scarfs and hatbands, and even the under-bearers had\ntrappings of woe which were of a good well-priced quality. The black\nprocession, when dismounted, looked the larger for the smallness of the\nchurchyard; the heavy human faces and the black draperies shivering in\nthe wind seemed to tell of a world strangely incongruous with the\nlightly dropping blossoms and the gleams of sunshine on the daisies.\nThe clergyman who met the procession was Mr. Cadwallader—also according\nto the request of Peter Featherstone, prompted as usual by peculiar\nreasons. Having a contempt for curates, whom he always called\nunderstrappers, he was resolved to be buried by a beneficed clergyman.\nMr. Casaubon was out of the question, not merely because he declined\nduty of this sort, but because Featherstone had an especial dislike to\nhim as the rector of his own parish, who had a lien on the land in the\nshape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the old\nman, being in his pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit\nthrough with an inward snarl. He had an objection to a parson stuck up\nabove his head preaching to him. But his relations with Mr. Cadwallader\nhad been of a different kind: the trout-stream which ran through Mr.\nCasaubon’s land took its course through Featherstone’s also, so that\nMr. Cadwallader was a parson who had had to ask a favor instead of\npreaching. Moreover, he was one of the high gentry living four miles\naway from Lowick, and was thus exalted to an equal sky with the sheriff\nof the county and other dignities vaguely regarded as necessary to the\nsystem of things. There would be a satisfaction in being buried by Mr.\nCadwallader, whose very name offered a fine opportunity for pronouncing\nwrongly if you liked.This distinction conferred on the Rector of Tipton and Freshitt was the\nreason why Mrs. Cadwallader made one of the group that watched old\nFeatherstone’s funeral from an upper window of the manor. She was not\nfond of visiting that house, but she liked, as she said, to see\ncollections of strange animals such as there would be at this funeral;\nand she had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the\nRector and herself to Lowick in order that the visit might be\naltogether pleasant.“I will go anywhere with you, Mrs. Cadwallader,” Celia had said; “but I\ndon’t like funerals.”“Oh, my dear, when you have a clergyman in your family you must\naccommodate your tastes: I did that very early. When I married Humphrey\nI made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by liking the end very\nmuch. That soon spread to the middle and the beginning, because I\ncouldn’t have the end without them.”“No, to be sure not,” said the Dowager Lady Chettam, with stately\nemphasis.The upper window from which the funeral could be well seen was in the\nroom occupied by Mr. Casaubon when he had been forbidden to work; but\nhe had resumed nearly his habitual style of life now in spite of\nwarnings and prescriptions, and after politely welcoming Mrs.\nCadwallader had slipped again into the library to chew a cud of erudite\nmistake about Cush and Mizraim."

  "content": "But for her visitors Dorothea too might have been shut up in the\nlibrary, and would not have witnessed this scene of old Featherstone’s\nfuneral, which, aloof as it seemed to be from the tenor of her life,\nalways afterwards came back to her at the touch of certain sensitive\npoints in memory, just as the vision of St. Peter’s at Rome was inwoven\nwith moods of despondency. Scenes which make vital changes in our\nneighbors’ lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a\nparticular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for\nus with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity\nwhich lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.The dream-like association of something alien and ill-understood with\nthe deepest secrets of her experience seemed to mirror that sense of\nloneliness which was due to the very ardor of Dorothea’s nature. The\ncountry gentry of old time lived in a rarefied social air: dotted apart\non their stations up the mountain they looked down with imperfect\ndiscrimination on the belts of thicker life below. And Dorothea was not\nat ease in the perspective and chilliness of that height.“I shall not look any more,” said Celia, after the train had entered\nthe church, placing herself a little behind her husband’s elbow so that\nshe could slyly touch his coat with her cheek. “I dare say Dodo likes\nit: she is fond of melancholy things and ugly people.”“I am fond of knowing something about the people I live among,” said\nDorothea, who had been watching everything with the interest of a monk\non his holiday tour. “It seems to me we know nothing of our neighbors,\nunless they are cottagers. One is constantly wondering what sort of\nlives other people lead, and how they take things. I am quite obliged\nto Mrs. Cadwallader for coming and calling me out of the library.”“Quite right to feel obliged to me,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Your rich\nLowick farmers are as curious as any buffaloes or bisons, and I dare\nsay you don’t half see them at church. They are quite different from\nyour uncle’s tenants or Sir James’s—monsters—farmers without\nlandlords—one can’t tell how to class them.”“Most of these followers are not Lowick people,” said Sir James; “I\nsuppose they are legatees from a distance, or from Middlemarch.\nLovegood tells me the old fellow has left a good deal of money as well\nas land.”“Think of that now! when so many younger sons can’t dine at their own\nexpense,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Ah,” turning round at the sound of\nthe opening door, “here is Mr. Brooke. I felt that we were incomplete\nbefore, and here is the explanation. You are come to see this odd\nfuneral, of course?”"

  "content": "“No, I came to look after Casaubon—to see how he goes on, you know. And\nto bring a little news—a little news, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke,\nnodding at Dorothea as she came towards him. “I looked into the\nlibrary, and I saw Casaubon over his books. I told him it wouldn’t do:\nI said, ‘This will never do, you know: think of your wife, Casaubon.’\nAnd he promised me to come up. I didn’t tell him my news: I said, he\nmust come up.”“Ah, now they are coming out of church,” Mrs. Cadwallader exclaimed.\n“Dear me, what a wonderfully mixed set! Mr. Lydgate as doctor, I\nsuppose. But that is really a good looking woman, and the fair young\nman must be her son. Who are they, Sir James, do you know?”“I see Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch; they are probably his wife and\nson,” said Sir James, looking interrogatively at Mr. Brooke, who nodded\nand said—“Yes, a very decent family—a very good fellow is Vincy; a credit to the\nmanufacturing interest. You have seen him at my house, you know.”“Ah, yes: one of your secret committee,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,\nprovokingly.“A coursing fellow, though,” said Sir James, with a fox-hunter’s\ndisgust.“And one of those who suck the life out of the wretched handloom\nweavers in Tipton and Freshitt. That is how his family look so fair and\nsleek,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Those dark, purple-faced people are an\nexcellent foil. Dear me, they are like a set of jugs! Do look at\nHumphrey: one might fancy him an ugly archangel towering above them in\nhis white surplice.”“It’s a solemn thing, though, a funeral,” said Mr. Brooke, “if you take\nit in that light, you know.”“But I am not taking it in that light. I can’t wear my solemnity too\noften, else it will go to rags. It was time the old man died, and none\nof these people are sorry.”“How piteous!” said Dorothea. “This funeral seems to me the most dismal\nthing I ever saw. It is a blot on the morning. I cannot bear to think\nthat any one should die and leave no love behind.”She was going to say more, but she saw her husband enter and seat\nhimself a little in the background. The difference his presence made to\nher was not always a happy one: she felt that he often inwardly\nobjected to her speech.“Positively,” exclaimed Mrs. Cadwallader, “there is a new face come out\nfrom behind that broad man queerer than any of them: a little round\nhead with bulging eyes—a sort of frog-face—do look. He must be of\nanother blood, I think.”"

  "content": "“Let me see!” said Celia, with awakened curiosity, standing behind Mrs.\nCadwallader and leaning forward over her head. “Oh, what an odd face!”\nThen with a quick change to another sort of surprised expression, she\nadded, “Why, Dodo, you never told me that Mr. Ladislaw was come again!”Dorothea felt a shock of alarm: every one noticed her sudden paleness\nas she looked up immediately at her uncle, while Mr. Casaubon looked at\nher.“He came with me, you know; he is my guest—puts up with me at the\nGrange,” said Mr. Brooke, in his easiest tone, nodding at Dorothea, as\nif the announcement were just what she might have expected. “And we\nhave brought the picture at the top of the carriage. I knew you would\nbe pleased with the surprise, Casaubon. There you are to the very\nlife—as Aquinas, you know. Quite the right sort of thing. And you will\nhear young Ladislaw talk about it. He talks uncommonly well—points out\nthis, that, and the other—knows art and everything of that\nkind—companionable, you know—is up with you in any track—what I’ve been\nwanting a long while.”Mr. Casaubon bowed with cold politeness, mastering his irritation, but\nonly so far as to be silent. He remembered Will’s letter quite as well\nas Dorothea did; he had noticed that it was not among the letters which\nhad been reserved for him on his recovery, and secretly concluding that\nDorothea had sent word to Will not to come to Lowick, he had shrunk\nwith proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject. He now\ninferred that she had asked her uncle to invite Will to the Grange; and\nshe felt it impossible at that moment to enter into any explanation.Mrs. Cadwallader’s eyes, diverted from the churchyard, saw a good deal\nof dumb show which was not so intelligible to her as she could have\ndesired, and could not repress the question, “Who is Mr. Ladislaw?”“A young relative of Mr. Casaubon’s,” said Sir James, promptly. His\ngood-nature often made him quick and clear-seeing in personal matters,\nand he had divined from Dorothea’s glance at her husband that there was\nsome alarm in her mind."

I have plenty of\nideas and facts, you know, and I can see he is just the man to put them\ninto shape—remembers what the right quotations are, _omne tulit\npunctum_, and that sort of thing—gives subjects a kind of turn. I\ninvited him some time ago when you were ill, Casaubon; Dorothea said\nyou couldn’t have anybody in the house, you know, and she asked me to\nwrite.”Poor Dorothea felt that every word of her uncle’s was about as pleasant\nas a grain of sand in the eye to Mr. Casaubon. It would be altogether\nunfitting now to explain that she had not wished her uncle to invite\nWill Ladislaw. She could not in the least make clear to herself the\nreasons for her husband’s dislike to his presence—a dislike painfully\nimpressed on her by the scene in the library; but she felt the\nunbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion of it to\nothers. Mr. Casaubon, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those\nmixed reasons to himself; irritated feeling with him, as with all of\nus, seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge. But he\nwished to repress outward signs, and only Dorothea could discern the\nchanges in her husband’s face before he observed with more of dignified\nbending and sing-song than usual—“You are exceedingly hospitable, my dear sir; and I owe you\nacknowledgments for exercising your hospitality towards a relative of\nmine.”The funeral was ended now, and the churchyard was being cleared.“Now you can see him, Mrs. Cadwallader,” said Celia. “He is just like a\nminiature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt that hangs in Dorothea’s boudoir—quite\nnice-looking.”“A very pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, dryly. “What is your\nnephew to be, Mr. Casaubon?”“Pardon me, he is not my nephew. He is my cousin.”“Well, you know,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “he is trying his wings. He is\njust the sort of young fellow to rise. I should be glad to give him an\nopportunity. He would make a good secretary, now, like Hobbes, Milton,\nSwift—that sort of man.”“I understand,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “One who can write speeches.”"

There you are to the life: a deep subtle sort of\nthinker with his fore-finger on the page, while Saint Bonaventure or\nsomebody else, rather fat and florid, is looking up at the Trinity.\nEverything is symbolical, you know—the higher style of art: I like that\nup to a certain point, but not too far—it’s rather straining to keep up\nwith, you know. But you are at home in that, Casaubon. And your\npainter’s flesh is good—solidity, transparency, everything of that\nsort. I went into that a great deal at one time. However, I’ll go and\nfetch Ladislaw.”CHAPTER XXXV.“Non, je ne comprends pas de plus charmant plaisir\nQue de voir d’héritiers une troupe affligée\nLe maintien interdit, et la mine allongée,\nLire un long testament où pales, étonnés\nOn leur laisse un bonsoir avec un pied de nez.\nPour voir au naturel leur tristesse profonde\nJe reviendrais, je crois, exprès de l’autre monde.”\n—REGNARD: _Le Légataire Universel_.When the animals entered the Ark in pairs, one may imagine that allied\nspecies made much private remark on each other, and were tempted to\nthink that so many forms feeding on the same store of fodder were\neminently superfluous, as tending to diminish the rations. (I fear the\npart played by the vultures on that occasion would be too painful for\nart to represent, those birds being disadvantageously naked about the\ngullet, and apparently without rites and ceremonies.)"
