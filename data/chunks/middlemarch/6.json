  "content": "He was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be seven-and-twenty,\nwithout any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his action\nshould be beneficent, and with ideas in his brain that made life\ninteresting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic\nrites of costly observance, which the eight hundred pounds left him\nafter buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying\nfor. He was at a starting-point which makes many a man’s career a fine\nsubject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that\namusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an\narduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of\ncircumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims\nand makes his point or else is carried headlong. The risk would remain\neven with close knowledge of Lydgate’s character; for character too is\na process and an unfolding. The man was still in the making, as much as\nthe Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer, and there were both\nvirtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding. The faults will\nnot, I hope, be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him.\nAmong our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little\ntoo self-confident and disdainful; whose distinguished mind is a little\nspotted with commonness; who is a little pinched here and protuberant\nthere with native prejudices; or whose better energies are liable to\nlapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient\nsolicitations? All these things might be alleged against Lydgate, but\nthen, they are the periphrases of a polite preacher, who talks of Adam,\nand would not like to mention anything painful to the pew-renters. The\nparticular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled\nhave distinguishable physiognomies, diction, accent, and grimaces;\nfilling up parts in very various dramas. Our vanities differ as our\nnoses do: all conceit is not the same conceit, but varies in\ncorrespondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us\ndiffers from another. Lydgate’s conceit was of the arrogant sort, never\nsimpering, never impertinent, but massive in its claims and\nbenevolently contemptuous. He would do a great deal for noodles, being\nsorry for them, and feeling quite sure that they could have no power\nover him: he had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he was in\nParis, in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines. All\nhis faults were marked by kindred traits, and were those of a man who\nhad a fine baritone, whose clothes hung well upon him, and who even in\nhis ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction. Where then lay\nthe spots of commonness? says a young lady enamoured of that careless\ngrace. How could there be any commonness in a man so well-bred, so\nambitious of social distinction, so generous and unusual in his views\nof social duty? As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius\nif you take him unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has\nthe best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in\nimagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach’s music,\nor the brilliant punning in the last burlesque. Lydgate’s spots of\ncommonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of\nnoble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in\nordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged to\nhis intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his feeling and judgment\nabout furniture, or women, or the desirability of its being known\n(without his telling) that he was better born than other country\nsurgeons. He did not mean to think of furniture at present; but\nwhenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes\nof reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there\nwould be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best."

  "content": "As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous\nfolly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant\nperiod would of course not be impetuous. For those who want to be\nacquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of\nimpetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving\nof passion to which he was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness\nwhich helped to make him morally lovable. The story can be told without\nmany words. It happened when he was studying in Paris, and just at the\ntime when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some\ngalvanic experiments. One evening, tired with his experimenting, and\nnot being able to elicit the facts he needed, he left his frogs and\nrabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation\nof unexplained shocks, and went to finish his evening at the theatre of\nthe Porte Saint Martin, where there was a melodrama which he had\nalready seen several times; attracted, not by the ingenious work of the\ncollaborating authors, but by an actress whose part it was to stab her\nlover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the piece. Lydgate\nwas in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he\nnever expects to speak to. She was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a\nGreek profile, and rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty\nwhich carries a sweet matronliness even in youth, and her voice was a\nsoft cooing. She had but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous\nreputation, her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover. It\nwas her acting which was “no better than it should be,” but the public\nwas satisfied. Lydgate’s only relaxation now was to go and look at this\nwoman, just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the\nsweet south on a bank of violets for a while, without prejudice to his\ngalvanism, to which he would presently return. But this evening the old\ndrama had a new catastrophe. At the moment when the heroine was to act\nthe stabbing of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife\nveritably stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed. A wild shriek\npierced the house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a\nswoon were demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this\ntime. Lydgate leaped and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the stage,\nand was active in help, making the acquaintance of his heroine by\nfinding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms.\nParis rang with the story of this death:—was it a murder? Some of the\nactress’s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt, and\nliked her the better for it (such was the taste of those times); but\nLydgate was not one of these. He vehemently contended for her\ninnocence, and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he\nhad felt before, had passed now into personal devotion, and tender\nthought of her lot. The notion of murder was absurd: no motive was\ndiscoverable, the young couple being understood to dote on each other;\nand it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should\nhave brought these grave consequences. The legal investigation ended in\nMadame Laure’s release. Lydgate by this time had had many interviews\nwith her, and found her more and more adorable. She talked little; but\nthat was an additional charm. She was melancholy, and seemed grateful;\nher presence was enough, like that of the evening light. Lydgate was\nmadly anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than\nhimself should win it and ask her to marry him. But instead of\nreopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would\nhave been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris\nwithout warning, forsaking her little court of admirers. Perhaps no one\ncarried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had come\nto a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by\never-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful\ncomforter. Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as\nsome other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered\nindications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons. He found her at\nlast acting with great success at Avignon under the same name, looking\nmore majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her\narms. He spoke to her after the play, was received with the usual\nquietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water, and\nobtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent on telling\nher that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him. He knew that\nthis was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his\nhabitual foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he was resolved\nto do. He had two selves within him apparently, and they must learn to\naccommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments. Strange, that\nsome of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our infatuations,\nand even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide plain where our\npersistent self pauses and awaits us."

  "content": "To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially\ntender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling\ntowards her.“You have come all the way from Paris to find me?” she said to him the\nnext day, sitting before him with folded arms, and looking at him with\neyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders.\n“Are all Englishmen like that?”“I came because I could not live without trying to see you. You are\nlonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait,\nbut I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one else.”Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under\nher grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt\nclose to her knees.“I will tell you something,” she said, in her cooing way, keeping her\narms folded. “My foot really slipped.”“I know, I know,” said Lydgate, deprecatingly. “It was a fatal\naccident—a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more.”Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, “_I meant to do\nit._”Lydgate, strong man as he was, turned pale and trembled: moments seemed\nto pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.“There was a secret, then,” he said at last, even vehemently. “He was\nbrutal to you: you hated him.”“No! he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and not in\nmy country; that was not agreeable to me.”“Great God!” said Lydgate, in a groan of horror. “And you planned to\nmurder him?”“I did not plan: it came to me in the play—_I meant to do it._”Lydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he\nlooked at her. He saw this woman—the first to whom he had given his\nyoung adoration—amid the throng of stupid criminals.“You are a good young man,” she said. “But I do not like husbands. I\nwill never have another.”"

  "content": "Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his Paris\nchambers, believing that illusions were at an end for him. He was saved\nfrom hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his\nbelief that human life might be made better. But he had more reason\nthan ever for trusting his judgment, now that it was so experienced;\nand henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman,\nentertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand.No one in Middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of Lydgate’s\npast as has here been faintly shadowed, and indeed the respectable\ntownsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager\nattempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did\nnot come under their own senses. Not only young virgins of that town,\nbut gray-bearded men also, were often in haste to conjecture how a new\nacquaintance might be wrought into their purposes, contented with very\nvague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for\nthat instrumentality. Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing\nLydgate and assimilating him very comfortably.CHAPTER XVI.“All that in woman is adored\n    In thy fair self I find—\nFor the whole sex can but afford\n    The handsome and the kind.”\n—SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain\nto the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and\nLydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power\nexercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode. The banker was evidently a\nruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among his supporters\nthere were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a\ncompromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general\nscheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you\nto hold a candle to the devil."

  "content": "Mr. Bulstrode’s power was not due simply to his being a country banker,\nwho knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could\ntouch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a beneficence\nthat was at once ready and severe—ready to confer obligations, and\nsevere in watching the result. He had gathered, as an industrious man\nalways at his post, a chief share in administering the town charities,\nand his private charities were both minute and abundant. He would take\na great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker’s son, and\nhe would watch over Tegg’s church-going; he would defend Mrs. Strype\nthe washerwoman against Stubbs’s unjust exaction on the score of her\ndrying-ground, and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs.\nStrype. His private minor loans were numerous, but he would inquire\nstrictly into the circumstances both before and after. In this way a\nman gathers a domain in his neighbors’ hope and fear as well as\ngratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region,\npropagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external\nmeans. It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as\npossible, that he might use it for the glory of God. He went through a\ngreat deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust\nhis motives, and make clear to himself what God’s glory required. But,\nas we have seen, his motives were not always rightly appreciated. There\nwere many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales could only\nweigh things in the lump; and they had a strong suspicion that since\nMr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion, eating and\ndrinking so little as he did, and worreting himself about everything,\nhe must have a sort of vampire’s feast in the sense of mastery.The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy’s table when Lydgate\nwas dining there, and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not,\nhe observed, prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the\nhost himself, though his reasons against the proposed arrangement\nturned entirely on his objection to Mr. Tyke’s sermons, which were all\ndoctrine, and his preference for Mr. Farebrother, whose sermons were\nfree from that taint. Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the\nchaplain’s having a salary, supposing it were given to Farebrother, who\nwas as good a little fellow as ever breathed, and the best preacher\nanywhere, and companionable too.“What line shall you take, then?” said Mr. Chichely, the coroner, a\ngreat coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy’s.“Oh, I’m precious glad I’m not one of the Directors now. I shall vote\nfor referring the matter to the Directors and the Medical Board\ntogether. I shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders,\nDoctor,” said Mr. Vincy, glancing first at Dr. Sprague, the senior\nphysician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat opposite. “You\nmedical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will\nprescribe, eh, Mr. Lydgate?”“I know little of either,” said Lydgate; “but in general, appointments\nare apt to be made too much a question of personal liking. The fittest\nman for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most\nagreeable. Sometimes, if you wanted to get a reform, your only way\nwould be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of, and\nput them out of the question.”"

  "content": "Dr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most “weight,” though\nDr. Minchin was usually said to have more “penetration,” divested his\nlarge heavy face of all expression, and looked at his wine-glass while\nLydgate was speaking. Whatever was not problematical and suspected\nabout this young man—for example, a certain showiness as to foreign\nideas, and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and\nforgotten by his elders—was positively unwelcome to a physician whose\nstanding had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on\nMeningitis, of which at least one copy marked “own” was bound in calf.\nFor my part I have some fellow-feeling with Dr. Sprague: one’s\nself-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very\nunpleasant to find deprecated.Lydgate’s remark, however, did not meet the sense of the company. Mr.\nVincy said, that if he could have _his_ way, he would not put\ndisagreeable fellows anywhere.“Hang your reforms!” said Mr. Chichely. “There’s no greater humbug in\nthe world. You never hear of a reform, but it means some trick to put\nin new men. I hope you are not one of the ‘Lancet’s’ men, Mr.\nLydgate—wanting to take the coronership out of the hands of the legal\nprofession: your words appear to point that way.”“I disapprove of Wakley,” interposed Dr. Sprague, “no man more: he is\nan ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the respectability of\nthe profession, which everybody knows depends on the London Colleges,\nfor the sake of getting some notoriety for himself. There are men who\ndon’t mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about.\nBut Wakley is right sometimes,” the Doctor added, judicially. “I could\nmention one or two points in which Wakley is in the right.”“Oh, well,” said Mr. Chichely, “I blame no man for standing up in favor\nof his own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like to know how a\ncoroner is to judge of evidence if he has not had a legal training?”“In my opinion,” said Lydgate, “legal training only makes a man more\nincompetent in questions that require knowledge of another kind. People\ntalk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales by a\nblind Justice. No man can judge what is good evidence on any particular\nsubject, unless he knows that subject well. A lawyer is no better than\nan old woman at a post-mortem examination. How is he to know the action\nof a poison? You might as well say that scanning verse will teach you\nto scan the potato crops.”“You are aware, I suppose, that it is not the coroner’s business to\nconduct the _post-mortem_, but only to take the evidence of the medical\nwitness?” said Mr. Chichely, with some scorn."

  "content": "“Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself,” said Lydgate.\n“Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance\nof decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the coroner ought not to\nbe a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the\nstomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell him so.”Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his\nMajesty’s coroner, and ended innocently with the question, “Don’t you\nagree with me, Dr. Sprague?”“To a certain extent—with regard to populous districts, and in the\nmetropolis,” said the Doctor. “But I hope it will be long before this\npart of the country loses the services of my friend Chichely, even\nthough it might get the best man in our profession to succeed him. I am\nsure Vincy will agree with me.”“Yes, yes, give me a coroner who is a good coursing man,” said Mr.\nVincy, jovially. “And in my opinion, you’re safest with a lawyer.\nNobody can know everything. Most things are ‘visitation of God.’ And as\nto poisoning, why, what you want to know is the law. Come, shall we\njoin the ladies?”Lydgate’s private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the very\ncoroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach, but he had not\nmeant to be personal. This was one of the difficulties of moving in\ngood Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a\nqualification for any salaried office. Fred Vincy had called Lydgate a\nprig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call him prick-eared;\nespecially when, in the drawing-room, he seemed to be making himself\neminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom he had easily monopolized in a\n_tête-à-tête_, since Mrs. Vincy herself sat at the tea-table. She\nresigned no domestic function to her daughter; and the matron’s\nblooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating\nfrom her fine throat, and her cheery manners to husband and children,\nwas certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy\nhouse—attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the\ndaughter. The tinge of unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in Mrs.\nVincy gave more effect to Rosamond’s refinement, which was beyond what\nLydgate had expected."

He regretted that he had\nnot heard her sing the other day at Stone Court. The only pleasure he\nallowed himself during the latter part of his stay in Paris was to go\nand hear music.“You have studied music, probably?” said Rosamond.“No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by ear;\nbut the music that I don’t know at all, and have no notion about,\ndelights me—affects me. How stupid the world is that it does not make\nmore use of such a pleasure within its reach!”“Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless. There are hardly any\ngood musicians. I only know two gentlemen who sing at all well.”“I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way,\nleaving you to fancy the tune—very much as if it were tapped on a\ndrum?”“Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer,” said Rosamond, with one of her rare\nsmiles. “But we are speaking very ill of our neighbors.”Lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation,\nin thinking how lovely this creature was, her garment seeming to be\nmade out of the faintest blue sky, herself so immaculately blond, as if\nthe petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her;\nand yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready,\nself-possessed grace. Since he had had the memory of Laure, Lydgate had\nlost all taste for large-eyed silence: the divine cow no longer\nattracted him, and Rosamond was her very opposite. But he recalled\nhimself.“You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.”“I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,” said Rosamond. “Papa is\nsure to insist on my singing. But I shall tremble before you, who have\nheard the best singers in Paris. I have heard very little: I have only\nonce been to London. But our organist at St. Peter’s is a good\nmusician, and I go on studying with him.”“Tell me what you saw in London.”"

But she remained simply serious, turned her long neck a\nlittle, and put up her hand to touch her wondrous hair-plaits—an\nhabitual gesture with her as pretty as any movements of a kitten’s paw.\nNot that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten: she was a sylph\ncaught young and educated at Mrs. Lemon’s.“I assure you my mind is raw,” she said immediately; “I pass at\nMiddlemarch. I am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors. But I am\nreally afraid of you.”“An accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men, though her\nknowledge is of a different sort. I am sure you could teach me a\nthousand things—as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were\nany common language between them. Happily, there is a common language\nbetween women and men, and so the bears can get taught.”“Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum! I must go and hinder him from\njarring all your nerves,” said Rosamond, moving to the other side of\nthe room, where Fred having opened the piano, at his father’s desire,\nthat Rosamond might give them some music, was parenthetically\nperforming “Cherry Ripe!” with one hand. Able men who have passed their\nexaminations will do these things sometimes, not less than the plucked\nFred.“Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make Mr.\nLydgate ill,” said Rosamond. “He has an ear.”Fred laughed, and went on with his tune to the end.Rosamond turned to Lydgate, smiling gently, and said, “You perceive,\nthe bears will not always be taught.”“Now then, Rosy!” said Fred, springing from the stool and twisting it\nupward for her, with a hearty expectation of enjoyment. “Some good\nrousing tunes first.”"

  "content": "Rosamond played admirably. Her master at Mrs. Lemon’s school (close to\na county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church\nand castle) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be\nfound in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted\nKapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of\nmusical celebrity. Rosamond, with the executant’s instinct, had seized\nhis manner of playing, and gave forth his large rendering of noble\nmusic with the precision of an echo. It was almost startling, heard for\nthe first time. A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from\nRosamond’s fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in\nperpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an\noriginating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter. Lydgate was\ntaken possession of, and began to believe in her as something\nexceptional. After all, he thought, one need not be surprised to find\nthe rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently\nunfavorable: come where they may, they always depend on conditions that\nare not obvious. He sat looking at her, and did not rise to pay her any\ncompliments, leaving that to others, now that his admiration was\ndeepened.Her singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and sweet to\nhear as a chime perfectly in tune. It is true she sang “Meet me by\nmoonlight,” and “I’ve been roaming”; for mortals must share the\nfashions of their time, and none but the ancients can be always\nclassical. But Rosamond could also sing “Black-eyed Susan” with effect,\nor Haydn’s canzonets, or “Voi, che sapete,” or “Batti, batti”—she only\nwanted to know what her audience liked."

  "content": "Her father looked round at the company, delighting in their admiration.\nHer mother sat, like a Niobe before her troubles, with her youngest\nlittle girl on her lap, softly beating the child’s hand up and down in\ntime to the music. And Fred, notwithstanding his general scepticism\nabout Rosy, listened to her music with perfect allegiance, wishing he\ncould do the same thing on his flute. It was the pleasantest family\nparty that Lydgate had seen since he came to Middlemarch. The Vincys\nhad the readiness to enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the\nbelief in life as a merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most\ncounty towns at that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain\nsuspicion as of plague-infection over the few amusements which survived\nin the provinces. At the Vincys’ there was always whist, and the\ncard-tables stood ready now, making some of the company secretly\nimpatient of the music. Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in—a\nhandsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose\nblack was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in his quick gray\neyes. He came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little\nLouisa with fatherly nonsense as she was being led out of the room by\nMiss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and seeming to\ncondense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the\nevening. He claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come\nand see him. “I can’t let you off, you know, because I have some\nbeetles to show you. We collectors feel an interest in every new man\ntill he has seen all we have to show him.”But soon he swerved to the whist-table, rubbing his hands and saying,\n“Come now, let us be serious! Mr. Lydgate? not play? Ah! you are too\nyoung and light for this kind of thing.”Lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so\npainful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable resort in\nthis certainly not erudite household. He could half understand it: the\ngood-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for\npassing the time without any labor of intelligence, might make the\nhouse beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd\nhours.Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was\nbrown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,\njust the sort of person for a governess. Lydgate did not mean to pay\nmany such visits himself. They were a wretched waste of the evenings;\nand now, when he had talked a little more to Rosamond, he meant to\nexcuse himself and go.“You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure,” she said, when the\nwhist-players were settled. “We are very stupid, and you have been used\nto something quite different.”“I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike,” said Lydgate. “But\nI have noticed that one always believes one’s own town to be more\nstupid than any other. I have made up my mind to take Middlemarch as it\ncomes, and shall be much obliged if the town will take me in the same\nway. I have certainly found some charms in it which are much greater\nthan I had expected.”“You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is pleased\nwith those,” said Rosamond, with simplicity.“No, I mean something much nearer to me.”Rosamond rose and reached her netting, and then said, “Do you care\nabout dancing at all? I am not quite sure whether clever men ever\ndance.”“I would dance with you if you would allow me.”"

  "content": "“Oh!” said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh. “I was only going\nto say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know whether you\nwould feel insulted if you were asked to come.”“Not on the condition I mentioned.”After this chat Lydgate thought that he was going, but on moving\ntowards the whist-tables, he got interested in watching Mr.\nFarebrother’s play, which was masterly, and also his face, which was a\nstriking mixture of the shrewd and the mild. At ten o’clock supper was\nbrought in (such were the customs of Middlemarch) and there was\npunch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water. He was\nwinning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers\nshould end, and Lydgate at last took his leave.But as it was not eleven o’clock, he chose to walk in the brisk air\ntowards the tower of St. Botolph’s, Mr. Farebrother’s church, which\nstood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight. It was the\noldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but a vicarage\nworth barely four hundred a-year. Lydgate had heard that, and he\nwondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money he won at\ncards; thinking, “He seems a very pleasant fellow, but Bulstrode may\nhave his good reasons.” Many things would be easier to Lydgate if it\nshould turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was generally justifiable. “What is\nhis religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along\nwith it? One must use such brains as are to be found.”"

  "content": "These were actually Lydgate’s first meditations as he walked away from\nMr. Vincy’s, and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider\nhim hardly worthy of their attention. He thought of Rosamond and her\nmusic only in the second place; and though, when her turn came, he\ndwelt on the image of her for the rest of his walk, he felt no\nagitation, and had no sense that any new current had set into his life.\nHe could not marry yet; he wished not to marry for several years; and\ntherefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love\nwith a girl whom he happened to admire. He did admire Rosamond\nexceedingly; but that madness which had once beset him about Laure was\nnot, he thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman.\nCertainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would\nhave been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just\nthe kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished, refined,\ndocile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life, and\nenshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration\nthat excluded the need for other evidence. Lydgate felt sure that if\never he married, his wife would have that feminine radiance, that\ndistinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music,\nthat sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous, being\nmoulded only for pure and delicate joys.But since he did not mean to marry for the next five years—his more\npressing business was to look into Louis’ new book on Fever, which he\nwas specially interested in, because he had known Louis in Paris, and\nhad followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the\nspecific differences of typhus and typhoid. He went home and read far\ninto the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details\nand relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it\nnecessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these\nbeing subjects on which he felt himself amply informed by literature,\nand that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial\nconversation of men. Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave him\nthat delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere\narbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power—combining and\nconstructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest\nobedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with\nimpartial Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its\nown work."

  "content": "Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of\ntheir profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:—reports of\nvery poor talk going on in distant orbs; or portraits of Lucifer coming\ndown on his bad errands as a large ugly man with bat’s wings and spurts\nof phosphorescence; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to reflect\nlife in a diseased dream. But these kinds of inspiration Lydgate\nregarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that\nreveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of lens, but tracked in\nthat outer darkness through long pathways of necessary sequence by the\ninward light which is the last refinement of Energy, capable of bathing\neven the ethereal atoms in its ideally illuminated space. He for his\npart had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds itself\nable and at ease: he was enamoured of that arduous invention which is\nthe very eye of research, provisionally framing its object and\ncorrecting it to more and more exactness of relation; he wanted to\npierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human\nmisery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares which are the first\nlurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate poise and\ntransition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy\nconsciousness.As he threw down his book, stretched his legs towards the embers in the\ngrate, and clasped his hands at the back of his head, in that agreeable\nafterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a\nspecific object into a suffusive sense of its connections with all the\nrest of our existence—seems, as it were, to throw itself on its back\nafter vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted\nstrength—Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies, and\nsomething like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his\nprofession.“If I had not taken that turn when I was a lad,” he thought, “I might\nhave got into some stupid draught-horse work or other, and lived always\nin blinkers. I should never have been happy in any profession that did\nnot call forth the highest intellectual strain, and yet keep me in good\nwarm contact with my neighbors. There is nothing like the medical\nprofession for that: one can have the exclusive scientific life that\ntouches the distance and befriend the old fogies in the parish too. It\nis rather harder for a clergyman: Farebrother seems to be an anomaly.”This last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures of the\nevening. They floated in his mind agreeably enough, and as he took up\nhis bed-candle his lips were curled with that incipient smile which is\napt to accompany agreeable recollections. He was an ardent fellow, but\nat present his ardor was absorbed in love of his work and in the\nambition of making his life recognized as a factor in the better life\nof mankind—like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure\ncountry practice to begin with."

  "content": "Poor Lydgate! or shall I say, Poor Rosamond! Each lived in a world of\nwhich the other knew nothing. It had not occurred to Lydgate that he\nhad been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond, who had neither any\nreason for throwing her marriage into distant perspective, nor any\npathological studies to divert her mind from that ruminating habit,\nthat inward repetition of looks, words, and phrases, which makes a\nlarge part in the lives of most girls. He had not meant to look at her\nor speak to her with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and\ncompliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed\nto him that his enjoyment of her music had remained almost silent, for\nhe feared falling into the rudeness of telling her his great surprise\nat her possession of such accomplishment. But Rosamond had registered\nevery look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of a\npreconceived romance—incidents which gather value from the foreseen\ndevelopment and climax. In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to\nimagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious\nbusiness in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever,\nas well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate\nwas his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch\nadmirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and\ngetting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which\nshe would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last\nassociate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked\ndown on the Middlemarchers. It was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to\ndiscern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank, and once when she had\nseen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes,\nand seated among the aristocracy, she had envied them, notwithstanding\ntheir plain dress.If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family\ncould cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the\nsense that she was in love with him, I will ask you to use your power\nof comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth\nand epaulets have never had an influence of that sort. Our passions do\nnot live apart in locked chambers, but, dressed in their small wardrobe\nof notions, bring their provisions to a common table and mess together,\nfeeding out of the common store according to their appetite.Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius\nLydgate as he was in himself, but with his relation to her; and it was\nexcusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men\nmight, could, would be, or actually were in love with her, to believe\nat once that Lydgate could be no exception. His looks and words meant\nmore to her than other men’s, because she cared more for them: she\nthought of them diligently, and diligently attended to that perfection\nof appearance, behavior, sentiments, and all other elegancies, which\nwould find in Lydgate a more adequate admirer than she had yet been\nconscious of.For Rosamond, though she would never do anything that was disagreeable\nto her, was industrious; and now more than ever she was active in\nsketching her landscapes and market-carts and portraits of friends, in\npractising her music, and in being from morning till night her own\nstandard of a perfect lady, having always an audience in her own\nconsciousness, with sometimes the not unwelcome addition of a more\nvariable external audience in the numerous visitors of the house. She\nfound time also to read the best novels, and even the second best, and\nshe knew much poetry by heart. Her favorite poem was “Lalla Rookh.”"

He will be a happy fellow who gets her!”\nwas the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the Vincys; and\nthe rejected young men thought of trying again, as is the fashion in\ncountry towns where the horizon is not thick with coming rivals. But\nMrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous\npitch, for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid\naside as soon as she was married?

  "content": "The Rev. Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next evening,\nlived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match\nthe church which it looked out upon. All the furniture too in the house\nwas old, but with another grade of age—that of Mr. Farebrother’s father\nand grandfather. There were painted white chairs, with gilding and\nwreaths on them, and some lingering red silk damask with slits in it.\nThere were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other celebrated\nlawyers of the last century; and there were old pier-glasses to reflect\nthem, as well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas resembling\na prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief against the\ndark wainscot. This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room into which\nLydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive him, who were\nalso old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine respectability: Mrs.\nFarebrother, the Vicar’s white-haired mother, befrilled and kerchiefed\nwith dainty cleanliness, upright, quick-eyed, and still under seventy;\nMiss Noble, her sister, a tiny old lady of meeker aspect, with frills\nand kerchief decidedly more worn and mended; and Miss Winifred\nFarebrother, the Vicar’s elder sister, well-looking like himself, but\nnipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who spend their lives\nin uninterrupted subjection to their elders. Lydgate had not expected\nto see so quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr. Farebrother was a\nbachelor, he had thought of being ushered into a snuggery where the\nchief furniture would probably be books and collections of natural\nobjects. The Vicar himself seemed to wear rather a changed aspect, as\nmost men do when acquaintances made elsewhere see them for the first\ntime in their own homes; some indeed showing like an actor of genial\nparts disadvantageously cast for the curmudgeon in a new piece. This\nwas not the case with Mr. Farebrother: he seemed a trifle milder and\nmore silent, the chief talker being his mother, while he only put in a\ngood-humored moderating remark here and there. The old lady was\nevidently accustomed to tell her company what they ought to think, and\nto regard no subject as quite safe without her steering. She was\nafforded leisure for this function by having all her little wants\nattended to by Miss Winifred. Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble carried on her\narm a small basket, into which she diverted a bit of sugar, which she\nhad first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake; looking round\nfurtively afterwards, and reverting to her teacup with a small innocent\nnoise as of a tiny timid quadruped. Pray think no ill of Miss Noble.\nThat basket held small savings from her more portable food, destined\nfor the children of her poor friends among whom she trotted on fine\nmornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures being so\nspontaneous a delight to her, that she regarded it much as if it had\nbeen a pleasant vice that she was addicted to. Perhaps she was\nconscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she\nmight give to those who had nothing, and carried in her conscience the\nguilt of that repressed desire. One must be poor to know the luxury of\ngiving!"

  "content": "Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and\nprecision. She presently informed him that they were not often in want\nof medical aid in that house. She had brought up her children to wear\nflannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit she considered\nthe chief reason why people needed doctors. Lydgate pleaded for those\nwhose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, but Mrs.\nFarebrother held that view of things dangerous: Nature was more just\nthan that; it would be easy for any felon to say that his ancestors\nought to have been hanged instead of him. If those who had bad fathers\nand mothers were bad themselves, they were hanged for that. There was\nno need to go back on what you couldn’t see.“My mother is like old George the Third,” said the Vicar, “she objects\nto metaphysics.”“I object to what is wrong, Camden. I say, keep hold of a few plain\ntruths, and make everything square with them. When I was young, Mr.\nLydgate, there never was any question about right and wrong. We knew\nour catechism, and that was enough; we learned our creed and our duty.\nEvery respectable Church person had the same opinions. But now, if you\nspeak out of the Prayer-book itself, you are liable to be\ncontradicted.”“That makes rather a pleasant time of it for those who like to maintain\ntheir own point,” said Lydgate.“But my mother always gives way,” said the Vicar, slyly.“No, no, Camden, you must not lead Mr. Lydgate into a mistake about\n_me_. I shall never show that disrespect to my parents, to give up what\nthey taught me. Any one may see what comes of turning. If you change\nonce, why not twenty times?”“A man might see good arguments for changing once, and not see them for\nchanging again,” said Lydgate, amused with the decisive old lady."

My father never changed, and he\npreached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man—few\nbetter. When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get\nyou a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book. That’s my opinion,\nand I think anybody’s stomach will bear me out.”“About the dinner certainly, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother.“It is the same thing, the dinner or the man. I am nearly seventy, Mr.\nLydgate, and I go upon experience. I am not likely to follow new\nlights, though there are plenty of them here as elsewhere. I say, they\ncame in with the mixed stuffs that will neither wash nor wear. It was\nnot so in my youth: a Churchman was a Churchman, and a clergyman, you\nmight be pretty sure, was a gentleman, if nothing else. But now he may\nbe no better than a Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on\npretence of doctrine. But whoever may wish to push him aside, I am\nproud to say, Mr. Lydgate, that he will compare with any preacher in\nthis kingdom, not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to\ngo by; at least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter.”“A mother is never partial,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling. “What do\nyou think Tyke’s mother says about him?”“Ah, poor creature! what indeed?” said Mrs. Farebrother, her sharpness\nblunted for the moment by her confidence in maternal judgments. “She\nsays the truth to herself, depend upon it.”“And what is the truth?” said Lydgate. “I am curious to know.”“Oh, nothing bad at all,” said Mr. Farebrother. “He is a zealous\nfellow: not very learned, and not very wise, I think—because I don’t\nagree with him.”“Why, Camden!” said Miss Winifred, “Griffin and his wife told me only\nto-day, that Mr. Tyke said they should have no more coals if they came\nto hear you preach.”Mrs. Farebrother laid down her knitting, which she had resumed after\nher small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at her son as if to\nsay “You hear that?” Miss Noble said, “Oh poor things! poor things!” in\nreference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal. But the\nVicar answered quietly—“That is because they are not my parishioners. And I don’t think my\nsermons are worth a load of coals to them.”"
