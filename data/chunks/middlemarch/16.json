  "content": "“He only feels confident that you will do it,” said Dorothea, in a\nvoice as clear and unhesitating as that of a young chorister chanting a\ncredo, “because you mean to enter Parliament as a member who cares for\nthe improvement of the people, and one of the first things to be made\nbetter is the state of the land and the laborers. Think of Kit Downes,\nuncle, who lives with his wife and seven children in a house with one\nsitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!—and those\npoor Dagleys, in their tumble-down farmhouse, where they live in the\nback kitchen and leave the other rooms to the rats! That is one reason\nwhy I did not like the pictures here, dear uncle—which you think me\nstupid about. I used to come from the village with all that dirt and\ncoarse ugliness like a pain within me, and the simpering pictures in\nthe drawing-room seemed to me like a wicked attempt to find delight in\nwhat is false, while we don’t mind how hard the truth is for the\nneighbors outside our walls. I think we have no right to come forward\nand urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to alter the evils\nwhich lie under our own hands.”Dorothea had gathered emotion as she went on, and had forgotten\neverything except the relief of pouring forth her feelings, unchecked:\nan experience once habitual with her, but hardly ever present since her\nmarriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear. For\nthe moment, Will’s admiration was accompanied with a chilling sense of\nremoteness. A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he cannot love a\nwoman so well when he sees a certain greatness in her: nature having\nintended greatness for men. But nature has sometimes made sad\noversights in carrying out her intention; as in the case of good Mr.\nBrooke, whose masculine consciousness was at this moment in rather a\nstammering condition under the eloquence of his niece. He could not\nimmediately find any other mode of expressing himself than that of\nrising, fixing his eye-glass, and fingering the papers before him. At\nlast he said—“There is something in what you say, my dear, something in what you\nsay—but not everything—eh, Ladislaw? You and I don’t like our pictures\nand statues being found fault with. Young ladies are a little ardent,\nyou know—a little one-sided, my dear. Fine art, poetry, that kind of\nthing, elevates a nation—_emollit mores_—you understand a little Latin\nnow. But—eh? what?”These interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come in to\nsay that the keeper had found one of Dagley’s boys with a leveret in\nhis hand just killed.“I’ll come, I’ll come. I shall let him off easily, you know,” said Mr.\nBrooke aside to Dorothea, shuffling away very cheerfully.“I hope you feel how right this change is that I—that Sir James wishes\nfor,” said Dorothea to Will, as soon as her uncle was gone."

I may\nnot have another opportunity of speaking to you about what has\noccurred,” said Will, rising with a movement of impatience, and holding\nthe back of his chair with both hands.“Pray tell me what it is,” said Dorothea, anxiously, also rising and\ngoing to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting and\nwagging his tail. She leaned her back against the window-frame, and\nlaid her hand on the dog’s head; for though, as we know, she was not\nfond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on, she was\nalways attentive to the feelings of dogs, and very polite if she had to\ndecline their advances.Will followed her only with his eyes and said, “I presume you know that\nMr. Casaubon has forbidden me to go to his house.”“No, I did not,” said Dorothea, after a moment’s pause. She was\nevidently much moved. “I am very, very sorry,” she added, mournfully.\nShe was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of—the conversation\nbetween her and her husband in the darkness; and she was anew smitten\nwith hopelessness that she could influence Mr. Casaubon’s action. But\nthe marked expression of her sorrow convinced Will that it was not all\ngiven to him personally, and that Dorothea had not been visited by the\nidea that Mr. Casaubon’s dislike and jealousy of him turned upon\nherself. He felt an odd mixture of delight and vexation: of delight\nthat he could dwell and be cherished in her thought as in a pure home,\nwithout suspicion and without stint—of vexation because he was of too\nlittle account with her, was not formidable enough, was treated with an\nunhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him. But his dread of\nany change in Dorothea was stronger than his discontent, and he began\nto speak again in a tone of mere explanation."

  "content": "“Mr. Casaubon’s reason is, his displeasure at my taking a position here\nwhich he considers unsuited to my rank as his cousin. I have told him\nthat I cannot give way on this point. It is a little too hard on me to\nexpect that my course in life is to be hampered by prejudices which I\nthink ridiculous. Obligation may be stretched till it is no better than\na brand of slavery stamped on us when we were too young to know its\nmeaning. I would not have accepted the position if I had not meant to\nmake it useful and honorable. I am not bound to regard family dignity\nin any other light.”Dorothea felt wretched. She thought her husband altogether in the\nwrong, on more grounds than Will had mentioned.“It is better for us not to speak on the subject,” she said, with a\ntremulousness not common in her voice, “since you and Mr. Casaubon\ndisagree. You intend to remain?” She was looking out on the lawn, with\nmelancholy meditation.“Yes; but I shall hardly ever see you now,” said Will, in a tone of\nalmost boyish complaint.“No,” said Dorothea, turning her eyes full upon him, “hardly ever. But\nI shall hear of you. I shall know what you are doing for my uncle.”“I shall know hardly anything about you,” said Will. “No one will tell\nme anything.”“Oh, my life is very simple,” said Dorothea, her lips curling with an\nexquisite smile, which irradiated her melancholy. “I am always at\nLowick.”“That is a dreadful imprisonment,” said Will, impetuously.“No, don’t think that,” said Dorothea. “I have no longings.”He did not speak, but she replied to some change in his expression. “I\nmean, for myself. Except that I should like not to have so much more\nthan my share without doing anything for others. But I have a belief of\nmy own, and it comforts me.”“What is that?” said Will, rather jealous of the belief.“That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don’t quite know\nwhat it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power\nagainst evil—widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with\ndarkness narrower.”“That is a beautiful mysticism—it is a—”"

  "content": "“Please not to call it by any name,” said Dorothea, putting out her\nhands entreatingly. “You will say it is Persian, or something else\ngeographical. It is my life. I have found it out, and cannot part with\nit. I have always been finding out my religion since I was a little\ngirl. I used to pray so much—now I hardly ever pray. I try not to have\ndesires merely for myself, because they may not be good for others, and\nI have too much already. I only told you, that you might know quite\nwell how my days go at Lowick.”“God bless you for telling me!” said Will, ardently, and rather\nwondering at himself. They were looking at each other like two fond\nchildren who were talking confidentially of birds.“What is _your_ religion?” said Dorothea. “I mean—not what you know\nabout religion, but the belief that helps you most?”“To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,” said Will. “But I\nam a rebel: I don’t feel bound, as you do, to submit to what I don’t\nlike.”“But if you like what is good, that comes to the same thing,” said\nDorothea, smiling.“Now you are subtle,” said Will.“Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don’t feel as if I\nwere subtle,” said Dorothea, playfully. “But how long my uncle is! I\nmust go and look for him. I must really go on to the Hall. Celia is\nexpecting me.”Will offered to tell Mr. Brooke, who presently came and said that he\nwould step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley’s,\nto speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the\nleveret. Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as they drove\nalong, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the talk under his\nown control.“Chettam, now,” he replied; “he finds fault with me, my dear; but I\nshould not preserve my game if it were not for Chettam, and he can’t\nsay that that expense is for the sake of the tenants, you know. It’s a\nlittle against my feeling:—poaching, now, if you come to look into it—I\nhave often thought of getting up the subject. Not long ago, Flavell,\nthe Methodist preacher, was brought up for knocking down a hare that\ncame across his path when he and his wife were walking out together. He\nwas pretty quick, and knocked it on the neck.”“That was very brutal, I think,” said Dorothea."

And Johnson said, ‘You may judge what a hypo_crite_\nhe is.’ And upon my word, I thought Flavell looked very little like\n‘the highest style of man’—as somebody calls the Christian—Young, the\npoet Young, I think—you know Young? Well, now, Flavell in his shabby\nblack gaiters, pleading that he thought the Lord had sent him and his\nwife a good dinner, and he had a right to knock it down, though not a\nmighty hunter before the Lord, as Nimrod was—I assure you it was rather\ncomic: Fielding would have made something of it—or Scott, now—Scott\nmight have worked it up. But really, when I came to think of it, I\ncouldn’t help liking that the fellow should have a bit of hare to say\ngrace over. It’s all a matter of prejudice—prejudice with the law on\nits side, you know—about the stick and the gaiters, and so on. However,\nit doesn’t do to reason about things; and law is law. But I got Johnson\nto be quiet, and I hushed the matter up. I doubt whether Chettam would\nnot have been more severe, and yet he comes down on me as if I were the\nhardest man in the county. But here we are at Dagley’s.”Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is\nwonderful how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we\nare blamed for them. Even our own persons in the glass are apt to\nchange their aspect for us after we have heard some frank remark on\ntheir less admirable points; and on the other hand it is astonishing\nhow pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never\ncomplain or have nobody to complain for them. Dagley’s homestead never\nbefore looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as it did today, with his mind\nthus sore about the fault-finding of the “Trumpet,” echoed by Sir\nJames."

  "content": "It is true that an observer, under that softening influence of the fine\narts which makes other people’s hardships picturesque, might have been\ndelighted with this homestead called Freeman’s End: the old house had\ndormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked\nwith ivy, the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and\nhalf the windows were closed with gray worm-eaten shutters about which\nthe jasmine-boughs grew in wild luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall\nwith hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled\nsubdued color, and there was an aged goat (kept doubtless on\ninteresting superstitious grounds) lying against the open back-kitchen\ndoor. The mossy thatch of the cow-shed, the broken gray barn-doors, the\npauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a\nwagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty dairy\nof cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in\nbrown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about\nthe uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too\nmeagre quality of rinsings,—all these objects under the quiet light of\na sky marbled with high clouds would have made a sort of picture which\nwe have all paused over as a “charming bit,” touching other\nsensibilities than those which are stirred by the depression of the\nagricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming capital, as seen\nconstantly in the newspapers of that time. But these troublesome\nassociations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke, and spoiled\nthe scene for him. Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the landscape,\ncarrying a pitchfork and wearing his milking-hat—a very old beaver\nflattened in front. His coat and breeches were the best he had, and he\nwould not have been wearing them on this weekday occasion if he had not\nbeen to market and returned later than usual, having given himself the\nrare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull. How he came\nto fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to\nhimself on the morrow; but before dinner something in the state of the\ncountry, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut,\nthe stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls,\nhad seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim about\nMiddlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should have\ngood drink, which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well\nfollowed up by rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in them\nthat they were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry: they\nonly made his discontent less tongue-tied than usual. He had also taken\ntoo much in the shape of muddy political talk, a stimulant dangerously\ndisturbing to his farming conservatism, which consisted in holding that\nwhatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse. He was\nflushed, and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he stood\nstill grasping his pitchfork, while the landlord approached with his\neasy shuffling walk, one hand in his trouser-pocket and the other\nswinging round a thin walking-stick."

Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said\nDagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog stir\nfrom his seat and prick his ears; but seeing Monk enter the yard after\nsome outside loitering, Fag seated himself again in an attitude of\nobservation. “I’m glad to hear I’m a good feller.”Mr. Brooke reflected that it was market-day, and that his worthy tenant\nhad probably been dining, but saw no reason why he should not go on,\nsince he could take the precaution of repeating what he had to say to\nMrs. Dagley.“Your little lad Jacob has been caught killing a leveret, Dagley: I\nhave told Johnson to lock him up in the empty stable an hour or two,\njust to frighten him, you know. But he will be brought home by-and-by,\nbefore night: and you’ll just look after him, will you, and give him a\nreprimand, you know?”“No, I woon’t: I’ll be dee’d if I’ll leather my boy to please you or\nanybody else, not if you was twenty landlords istid o’ one, and that a\nbad un.”Dagley’s words were loud enough to summon his wife to the back-kitchen\ndoor—the only entrance ever used, and one always open except in bad\nweather—and Mr. Brooke, saying soothingly, “Well, well, I’ll speak to\nyour wife—I didn’t mean beating, you know,” turned to walk to the\nhouse. But Dagley, only the more inclined to “have his say” with a\ngentleman who walked away from him, followed at once, with Fag\nslouching at his heels and sullenly evading some small and probably\ncharitable advances on the part of Monk.“How do you do, Mrs. Dagley?” said Mr. Brooke, making some haste. “I\ncame to tell you about your boy: I don’t want you to give him the\nstick, you know.” He was careful to speak quite plainly this time."

But her husband was beforehand in\nanswering.“No, nor he woon’t hev the stick, whether you want it or no,” pursued\nDagley, throwing out his voice, as if he wanted it to hit hard. “You’ve\ngot no call to come an’ talk about sticks o’ these primises, as you\nwoon’t give a stick tow’rt mending. Go to Middlemarch to ax for _your_\ncharrickter.”“You’d far better hold your tongue, Dagley,” said the wife, “and not\nkick your own trough over. When a man as is father of a family has been\nan’ spent money at market and made himself the worse for liquor, he’s\ndone enough mischief for one day. But I should like to know what my\nboy’s done, sir.”“Niver do you mind what he’s done,” said Dagley, more fiercely, “it’s\nmy business to speak, an’ not yourn. An’ I wull speak, too. I’ll hev my\nsay—supper or no. An’ what I say is, as I’ve lived upo’ your ground\nfrom my father and grandfather afore me, an’ hev dropped our money\ninto’t, an’ me an’ my children might lie an’ rot on the ground for\ntop-dressin’ as we can’t find the money to buy, if the King wasn’t to\nput a stop.”“My good fellow, you’re drunk, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,\nconfidentially but not judiciously. “Another day, another day,” he\nadded, turning as if to go.But Dagley immediately fronted him, and Fag at his heels growled low,\nas his master’s voice grew louder and more insulting, while Monk also\ndrew close in silent dignified watch. The laborers on the wagon were\npausing to listen, and it seemed wiser to be quite passive than to\nattempt a ridiculous flight pursued by a bawling man."

An’ I meean as the King ’ull put a\nstop to ’t, for them say it as knows it, as there’s to be a Rinform,\nand them landlords as never done the right thing by their tenants ’ull\nbe treated i’ that way as they’ll hev to scuttle off. An’ there’s them\ni’ Middlemarch knows what the Rinform is—an’ as knows who’ll hev to\nscuttle.

That’s what they says. An’ I made out what the Rinform were—an’\nit were to send you an’ your likes a-scuttlin’ an’ wi’ pretty\nstrong-smellin’ things too.

That’s what I’n got\nto say,” concluded Mr. Dagley, striking his fork into the ground with a\nfirmness which proved inconvenient as he tried to draw it up again.At this last action Monk began to bark loudly, and it was a moment for\nMr. Brooke to escape. He walked out of the yard as quickly as he could,\nin some amazement at the novelty of his situation. He had never been\ninsulted on his own land before, and had been inclined to regard\nhimself as a general favorite (we are all apt to do so, when we think\nof our own amiability more than of what other people are likely to want\nof us). When he had quarrelled with Caleb Garth twelve years before he\nhad thought that the tenants would be pleased at the landlord’s taking\neverything into his own hands.Some who follow the narrative of his experience may wonder at the\nmidnight darkness of Mr. Dagley; but nothing was easier in those times\nthan for an hereditary farmer of his grade to be ignorant, in spite\nsomehow of having a rector in the twin parish who was a gentleman to\nthe backbone, a curate nearer at hand who preached more learnedly than\nthe rector, a landlord who had gone into everything, especially fine\nart and social improvement, and all the lights of Middlemarch only\nthree miles off. As to the facility with which mortals escape\nknowledge, try an average acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of\nLondon, and consider what that eligible person for a dinner-party would\nhave been if he had learned scant skill in “summing” from the\nparish-clerk of Tipton, and read a chapter in the Bible with immense\ndifficulty, because such names as Isaiah or Apollos remained\nunmanageable after twice spelling. Poor Dagley read a few verses\nsometimes on a Sunday evening, and the world was at least not darker to\nhim than it had been before. Some things he knew thoroughly, namely,\nthe slovenly habits of farming, and the awkwardness of weather, stock\nand crops, at Freeman’s End—so called apparently by way of sarcasm, to\nimply that a man was free to quit it if he chose, but that there was no\nearthly “beyond” open to him.CHAPTER XL."

The group I am moving towards is at Caleb Garth’s\nbreakfast-table in the large parlor where the maps and desk were:\nfather, mother, and five of the children. Mary was just now at home\nwaiting for a situation, while Christy, the boy next to her, was\ngetting cheap learning and cheap fare in Scotland, having to his\nfather’s disappointment taken to books instead of that sacred calling\n“business.”The letters had come—nine costly letters, for which the postman had\nbeen paid three and twopence, and Mr. Garth was forgetting his tea and\ntoast while he read his letters and laid them open one above the other,\nsometimes swaying his head slowly, sometimes screwing up his mouth in\ninward debate, but not forgetting to cut off a large red seal unbroken,\nwhich Letty snatched up like an eager terrier.The talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly, for nothing disturbed\nCaleb’s absorption except shaking the table when he was writing.Two letters of the nine had been for Mary. After reading them, she had\npassed them to her mother, and sat playing with her tea-spoon absently,\ntill with a sudden recollection she returned to her sewing, which she\nhad kept on her lap during breakfast.“Oh, don’t sew, Mary!” said Ben, pulling her arm down. “Make me a\npeacock with this bread-crumb.” He had been kneading a small mass for\nthe purpose.“No, no, Mischief!” said Mary, good-humoredly, while she pricked his\nhand lightly with her needle. “Try and mould it yourself: you have seen\nme do it often enough. I must get this sewing done. It is for Rosamond\nVincy: she is to be married next week, and she can’t be married without\nthis handkerchief.” Mary ended merrily, amused with the last notion."

I like to teach classes best. And,\nyou see, I must teach: there is nothing else to be done.”“Teaching seems to me the most delightful work in the world,” said Mrs.\nGarth, with a touch of rebuke in her tone. “I could understand your\nobjection to it if you had not knowledge enough, Mary, or if you\ndisliked children.”“I suppose we never quite understand why another dislikes what we like,\nmother,” said Mary, rather curtly. “I am not fond of a schoolroom: I\nlike the outside world better. It is a very inconvenient fault of\nmine.”“It must be very stupid to be always in a girls’ school,” said Alfred.\n“Such a set of nincompoops, like Mrs. Ballard’s pupils walking two and\ntwo.”“And they have no games worth playing at,” said Jim. “They can neither\nthrow nor leap.

I have determined to take it. It is\nquite the best. Thirty-five pounds a-year, and extra pay for teaching\nthe smallest strummers at the piano.”“Poor child!

The Baronet added in\nvery obliging words that he himself was particularly desirous of seeing\nthe Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same management, and he hoped\nto be able to show that the double agency might be held on terms\nagreeable to Mr. Garth, whom he would be glad to see at the Hall at\ntwelve o’clock on the following day."

Mrs. Garth,\nin placid joy, began to put the cups and plates together, while Caleb\npushing his chair from the table, as if he were going to move to the\ndesk, still sat holding his letters in his hand and looking on the\nground meditatively, stretching out the fingers of his left hand,\naccording to a mute language of his own.

And I’ll lay a wager we can get fine bricks out of the clay at\nBott’s corner. I must look into that: it would cheapen the repairs.\nIt’s a fine bit of work, Susan! A man without a family would be glad to\ndo it for nothing.”“Mind you don’t, though,” said his wife, lifting up her finger.“No, no; but it’s a fine thing to come to a man when he’s seen into the\nnature of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of the country\ninto good fettle, as they say, and putting men into the right way with\ntheir farming, and getting a bit of good contriving and solid building\ndone—that those who are living and those who come after will be the\nbetter for. I’d sooner have it than a fortune. I hold it the most\nhonorable work that is.” Here Caleb laid down his letters, thrust his\nfingers between the buttons of his waistcoat, and sat upright, but\npresently proceeded with some awe in his voice and moving his head\nslowly aside—“It’s a great gift of God, Susan.”“That it is, Caleb,” said his wife, with answering fervor. “And it will\nbe a blessing to your children to have had a father who did such work:\na father whose good work remains though his name may be forgotten.” She\ncould not say any more to him then about the pay."

  "content": "In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his day’s work, was\nseated in silence with his pocket-book open on his knee, while Mrs.\nGarth and Mary were at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was\nwhispering a dialogue with her doll, Mr. Farebrother came up the\norchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the\ntufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he was fond of his\nparishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to\nLydgate. He used to the full the clergyman’s privilege of disregarding\nthe Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told his mother\nthat Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town. Still,\nyou see, he spent his evenings at the Vincys’, where the matron, though\nless of a lady, presided over a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In\nthose days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect. But\nthe Vicar did heartily respect the Garths, and a visit from him was no\nsurprise to that family. Nevertheless he accounted for it even while he\nwas shaking hands, by saying, “I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I have\nsomething to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The fact is,\npoor fellow,” he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with\nhis bright glance at the three who were listening to him, “he has taken\nme into his confidence.”Mary’s heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred’s\nconfidence had gone.“We haven’t seen the lad for months,” said Caleb. “I couldn’t think\nwhat was become of him.”“He has been away on a visit,” said the Vicar, “because home was a\nlittle too hot for him, and Lydgate told his mother that the poor\nfellow must not begin to study yet. But yesterday he came and poured\nhimself out to me. I am very glad he did, because I have seen him grow\nup from a youngster of fourteen, and I am so much at home in the house\nthat the children are like nephews and nieces to me. But it is a\ndifficult case to advise upon. However, he has asked me to come and\ntell you that he is going away, and that he is so miserable about his\ndebt to you, and his inability to pay, that he can’t bear to come\nhimself even to bid you good by.”“Tell him it doesn’t signify a farthing,” said Caleb, waving his hand.\n“We’ve had the pinch and have got over it. And now I’m going to be as\nrich as a Jew.”“Which means,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, “that we are\ngoing to have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary at\nhome.”“What is the treasure-trove?” said Mr. Farebrother.“I’m going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and\nperhaps for a pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it’s all the\nsame family connection, and employment spreads like water if it’s once\nset going. It makes me very happy, Mr. Farebrother”—here Caleb threw\nback his head a little, and spread his arms on the elbows of his\nchair—“that I’ve got an opportunity again with the letting of the land,\nand carrying out a notion or two with improvements. It’s a most\nuncommonly cramping thing, as I’ve often told Susan, to sit on\nhorseback and look over the hedges at the wrong thing, and not be able\nto put your hand to it to make it right. What people do who go into\npolitics I can’t think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement\nover only a few hundred acres.”"

  "content": "It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but his\nhappiness had the effect of mountain air: his eyes were bright, and the\nwords came without effort.“I congratulate you heartily, Garth,” said the Vicar. “This is the best\nsort of news I could have had to carry to Fred Vincy, for he dwelt a\ngood deal on the injury he had done you in causing you to part with\nmoney—robbing you of it, he said—which you wanted for other purposes. I\nwish Fred were not such an idle dog; he has some very good points, and\nhis father is a little hard upon him.”“Where is he going?” said Mrs. Garth, rather coldly.“He means to try again for his degree, and he is going up to study\nbefore term. I have advised him to do that. I don’t urge him to enter\nthe Church—on the contrary. But if he will go and work so as to pass,\nthat will be some guarantee that he has energy and a will; and he is\nquite at sea; he doesn’t know what else to do. So far he will please\nhis father, and I have promised in the mean time to try and reconcile\nVincy to his son’s adopting some other line of life. Fred says frankly\nhe is not fit for a clergyman, and I would do anything I could to\nhinder a man from the fatal step of choosing the wrong profession. He\nquoted to me what you said, Miss Garth—do you remember it?” (Mr.\nFarebrother used to say “Mary” instead of “Miss Garth,” but it was part\nof his delicacy to treat her with the more deference because, according\nto Mrs. Vincy’s phrase, she worked for her bread.)Mary felt uncomfortable, but, determined to take the matter lightly,\nanswered at once, “I have said so many impertinent things to Fred—we\nare such old playfellows.”“You said, according to him, that he would be one of those ridiculous\nclergymen who help to make the whole clergy ridiculous. Really, that\nwas so cutting that I felt a little cut myself.”Caleb laughed. “She gets her tongue from you, Susan,” he said, with\nsome enjoyment.“Not its flippancy, father,” said Mary, quickly, fearing that her\nmother would be displeased. “It is rather too bad of Fred to repeat my\nflippant speeches to Mr. Farebrother.”"

Things hang together,” he added, looking on the\nfloor and moving his feet uneasily with a sense that words were\nscantier than thoughts.“Clearly,” said the Vicar, amused. “By being contemptible we set men’s\nminds to the tune of contempt. I certainly agree with Miss Garth’s view\nof the matter, whether I am condemned by it or not. But as to Fred\nVincy, it is only fair he should be excused a little: old\nFeatherstone’s delusive behavior did help to spoil him. There was\nsomething quite diabolical in not leaving him a farthing after all. But\nFred has the good taste not to dwell on that. And what he cares most\nabout is having offended you, Mrs. Garth; he supposes you will never\nthink well of him again.”“I have been disappointed in Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, with decision.\n“But I shall be ready to think well of him again when he gives me good\nreason to do so.”At this point Mary went out of the room, taking Letty with her."

Now Mary’s gone out, I must tell\nyou a thing—it’s only known to Susan and me, and you’ll not tell it\nagain. The old scoundrel wanted Mary to burn one of the wills the very\nnight he died, when she was sitting up with him by herself, and he\noffered her a sum of money that he had in the box by him if she would\ndo it. But Mary, you understand, could do no such thing—would not be\nhandling his iron chest, and so on. Now, you see, the will he wanted\nburnt was this last, so that if Mary had done what he wanted, Fred\nVincy would have had ten thousand pounds. The old man did turn to him\nat the last. That touches poor Mary close; she couldn’t help it—she was\nin the right to do what she did, but she feels, as she says, much as if\nshe had knocked down somebody’s property and broken it against her\nwill, when she was rightfully defending herself. I feel with her,\nsomehow, and if I could make any amends to the poor lad, instead of\nbearing him a grudge for the harm he did us, I should be glad to do it.\nNow, what is your opinion, sir? Susan doesn’t agree with me; she\nsays—tell what you say, Susan.”“Mary could not have acted otherwise, even if she had known what would\nbe the effect on Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, pausing from her work, and\nlooking at Mr. Farebrother.“And she was quite ignorant of it. It seems to me, a loss which falls\non another because we have done right is not to lie upon our\nconscience.”The Vicar did not answer immediately, and Caleb said, “It’s the\nfeeling. The child feels in that way, and I feel with her. You don’t\nmean your horse to tread on a dog when you’re backing out of the way;\nbut it goes through you, when it’s done.”“I am sure Mrs. Garth would agree with you there,” said Mr.\nFarebrother, who for some reason seemed more inclined to ruminate than\nto speak. “One could hardly say that the feeling you mention about Fred\nis wrong—or rather, mistaken—though no man ought to make a claim on\nsuch feeling.”“Well, well,” said Caleb, “it’s a secret. You will not tell Fred.”“Certainly not. But I shall carry the other good news—that you can\nafford the loss he caused you.”"

  "content": "Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the\norchard with Letty, went to say good-by to her. They made a pretty\npicture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the\napples on the old scant-leaved boughs—Mary in her lavender gingham and\nblack ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in her well-worn nankin\npicked up the fallen apples. If you want to know more particularly how\nMary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded\nstreet to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: she will not be among\nthose daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out\nnecks and wanton eyes, mincing as they go: let all those pass, and fix\nyour eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet\ncarriage, who looks about her, but does not suppose that anybody is\nlooking at her. If she has a broad face and square brow, well-marked\neyebrows and curly dark hair, a certain expression of amusement in her\nglance which her mouth keeps the secret of, and for the rest features\nentirely insignificant—take that ordinary but not disagreeable person\nfor a portrait of Mary Garth. If you made her smile, she would show you\nperfect little teeth; if you made her angry, she would not raise her\nvoice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever\ntasted the flavor of; if you did her a kindness, she would never forget\nit. Mary admired the keen-faced handsome little Vicar in his\nwell-brushed threadbare clothes more than any man she had had the\nopportunity of knowing. She had never heard him say a foolish thing,\nthough she knew that he did unwise ones; and perhaps foolish sayings\nwere more objectionable to her than any of Mr. Farebrother’s unwise\ndoings. At least, it was remarkable that the actual imperfections of\nthe Vicar’s clerical character never seemed to call forth the same\nscorn and dislike which she showed beforehand for the predicted\nimperfections of the clerical character sustained by Fred Vincy. These\nirregularities of judgment, I imagine, are found even in riper minds\nthan Mary Garth’s: our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and\ndemerit, which none of us ever saw. Will any one guess towards which of\nthose widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman’s\ntenderness?—the one she was most inclined to be severe on, or the\ncontrary?"

But I am very glad to hear that he is\ngoing away to work.”“On the other hand, I am very glad to hear that _you_ are not going\naway to work. My mother, I am sure, will be all the happier if you will\ncome to see her at the vicarage: you know she is fond of having young\npeople to talk to, and she has a great deal to tell about old times.\nYou will really be doing a kindness.”“I should like it very much, if I may,” said Mary. “Everything seems\ntoo happy for me all at once.

  "content": "As the Vicar walked to Lowick, any one watching him closely might have\nseen him twice shrug his shoulders. I think that the rare Englishmen\nwho have this gesture are never of the heavy type—for fear of any\nlumbering instance to the contrary, I will say, hardly ever; they have\nusually a fine temperament and much tolerance towards the smaller\nerrors of men (themselves inclusive). The Vicar was holding an inward\ndialogue in which he told himself that there was probably something\nmore between Fred and Mary Garth than the regard of old playfellows,\nand replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not a\ngreat deal too choice for that crude young gentleman. The rejoinder to\nthis was the first shrug. Then he laughed at himself for being likely\nto have felt jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which,\nadded he, it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not. Whereupon\nfollowed the second shrug.What could two men, so different from each other, see in this “brown\npatch,” as Mary called herself? It was certainly not her plainness that\nattracted them (and let all plain young ladies be warned against the\ndangerous encouragement given them by Society to confide in their want\nof beauty). A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very\nwonderful whole, the slow creation of long interchanging influences:\nand charm is a result of two such wholes, the one loving and the one\nloved.When Mr. and Mrs. Garth were sitting alone, Caleb said, “Susan, guess\nwhat I’m thinking of.”“The rotation of crops,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at him, above her\nknitting, “or else the back-doors of the Tipton cottages.”“No,” said Caleb, gravely; “I am thinking that I could do a great turn\nfor Fred Vincy. Christy’s gone, Alfred will be gone soon, and it will\nbe five years before Jim is ready to take to business. I shall want\nhelp, and Fred might come in and learn the nature of things and act\nunder me, and it might be the making of him into a useful man, if he\ngives up being a parson. What do you think?”“I think, there is hardly anything honest that his family would object\nto more,” said Mrs. Garth, decidedly.“What care I about their objecting?” said Caleb, with a sturdiness\nwhich he was apt to show when he had an opinion. “The lad is of age and\nmust get his bread. He has sense enough and quickness enough; he likes\nbeing on the land, and it’s my belief that he could learn business well\nif he gave his mind to it.”“But would he? His father and mother wanted him to be a fine gentleman,\nand I think he has the same sort of feeling himself. They all think us\nbeneath them. And if the proposal came from you, I am sure Mrs. Vincy\nwould say that we wanted Fred for Mary.”“Life is a poor tale, if it is to be settled by nonsense of that sort,”\nsaid Caleb, with disgust.“Yes, but there is a certain pride which is proper, Caleb.”"

There’s no sort of work,” said Caleb, with fervor, putting\nout his hand and moving it up and down to mark his emphasis, “that\ncould ever be done well, if you minded what fools say. You must have it\ninside you that your plan is right, and that plan you must follow.”“I will not oppose any plan you have set your mind on, Caleb,” said\nMrs. Garth, who was a firm woman, but knew that there were some points\non which her mild husband was yet firmer. “Still, it seems to be fixed\nthat Fred is to go back to college: will it not be better to wait and\nsee what he will choose to do after that? It is not easy to keep people\nagainst their will. And you are not yet quite sure enough of your own\nposition, or what you will want.”“Well, it may be better to wait a bit.

I’ve always had my hands full\nwith scattered things, and there’s always something fresh turning up.\nWhy, only yesterday—bless me, I don’t think I told you!—it was rather\nodd that two men should have been at me on different sides to do the\nsame bit of valuing.

He was fond of a pinch when it occurred\nto him, but he usually forgot that this indulgence was at his command.His wife held down her knitting and looked attentive.“Why, that Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, was one. But Bulstrode was\nbefore him, so I’m going to do it for Bulstrode. Whether it’s mortgage\nor purchase they’re going for, I can’t tell yet.”“Can that man be going to sell the land just left him—which he has\ntaken the name for?” said Mrs. Garth.“Deuce knows,” said Caleb, who never referred the knowledge of\ndiscreditable doings to any higher power than the deuce. “But Bulstrode\nhas long been wanting to get a handsome bit of land under his\nfingers—that I know. And it’s a difficult matter to get, in this part\nof the country.”"
