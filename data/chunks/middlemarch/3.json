  "content": "“Do you know, Dorothea, I saw some one quite young coming up one of the\nwalks.”“Is that astonishing, Celia?”“There may be a young gardener, you know—why not?” said Mr. Brooke. “I\ntold Casaubon he should change his gardener.”“No, not a gardener,” said Celia; “a gentleman with a sketch-book. He\nhad light-brown curls. I only saw his back. But he was quite young.”“The curate’s son, perhaps,” said Mr. Brooke. “Ah, there is Casaubon\nagain, and Tucker with him. He is going to introduce Tucker. You don’t\nknow Tucker yet.”Mr. Tucker was the middle-aged curate, one of the “inferior clergy,”\nwho are usually not wanting in sons. But after the introduction, the\nconversation did not lead to any question about his family, and the\nstartling apparition of youthfulness was forgotten by every one but\nCelia. She inwardly declined to believe that the light-brown curls and\nslim figure could have any relationship to Mr. Tucker, who was just as\nold and musty-looking as she would have expected Mr. Casaubon’s curate\nto be; doubtless an excellent man who would go to heaven (for Celia\nwished not to be unprincipled), but the corners of his mouth were so\nunpleasant. Celia thought with some dismalness of the time she should\nhave to spend as bridesmaid at Lowick, while the curate had probably no\npretty little children whom she could like, irrespective of principle."

  "content": "Mr. Tucker was invaluable in their walk; and perhaps Mr. Casaubon had\nnot been without foresight on this head, the curate being able to\nanswer all Dorothea’s questions about the villagers and the other\nparishioners. Everybody, he assured her, was well off in Lowick: not a\ncottager in those double cottages at a low rent but kept a pig, and the\nstrips of garden at the back were well tended. The small boys wore\nexcellent corduroy, the girls went out as tidy servants, or did a\nlittle straw-plaiting at home: no looms here, no Dissent; and though\nthe public disposition was rather towards laying by money than towards\nspirituality, there was not much vice. The speckled fowls were so\nnumerous that Mr. Brooke observed, “Your farmers leave some barley for\nthe women to glean, I see. The poor folks here might have a fowl in\ntheir pot, as the good French king used to wish for all his people. The\nFrench eat a good many fowls—skinny fowls, you know.”“I think it was a very cheap wish of his,” said Dorothea, indignantly.\n“Are kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal\nvirtue?”“And if he wished them a skinny fowl,” said Celia, “that would not be\nnice. But perhaps he wished them to have fat fowls.”“Yes, but the word has dropped out of the text, or perhaps was\nsubauditum; that is, present in the king’s mind, but not uttered,” said\nMr. Casaubon, smiling and bending his head towards Celia, who\nimmediately dropped backward a little, because she could not bear Mr.\nCasaubon to blink at her.Dorothea sank into silence on the way back to the house. She felt some\ndisappointment, of which she was yet ashamed, that there was nothing\nfor her to do in Lowick; and in the next few minutes her mind had\nglanced over the possibility, which she would have preferred, of\nfinding that her home would be in a parish which had a larger share of\nthe world’s misery, so that she might have had more active duties in\nit. Then, recurring to the future actually before her, she made a\npicture of more complete devotion to Mr. Casaubon’s aims in which she\nwould await new duties. Many such might reveal themselves to the higher\nknowledge gained by her in that companionship.Mr. Tucker soon left them, having some clerical work which would not\nallow him to lunch at the Hall; and as they were re-entering the garden\nthrough the little gate, Mr. Casaubon said—“You seem a little sad, Dorothea. I trust you are pleased with what you\nhave seen.”“I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong,” answered\nDorothea, with her usual openness—“almost wishing that the people\nwanted more to be done for them here. I have known so few ways of\nmaking my life good for anything. Of course, my notions of usefulness\nmust be narrow. I must learn new ways of helping people.”“Doubtless,” said Mr. Casaubon. “Each position has its corresponding\nduties. Yours, I trust, as the mistress of Lowick, will not leave any\nyearning unfulfilled.”"

  "content": "“Indeed, I believe that,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “Do not suppose\nthat I am sad.”“That is well. But, if you are not tired, we will take another way to\nthe house than that by which we came.”Dorothea was not at all tired, and a little circuit was made towards a\nfine yew-tree, the chief hereditary glory of the grounds on this side\nof the house. As they approached it, a figure, conspicuous on a dark\nbackground of evergreens, was seated on a bench, sketching the old\ntree. Mr. Brooke, who was walking in front with Celia, turned his head,\nand said—“Who is that youngster, Casaubon?”They had come very near when Mr. Casaubon answered—“That is a young relative of mine, a second cousin: the grandson, in\nfact,” he added, looking at Dorothea, “of the lady whose portrait you\nhave been noticing, my aunt Julia.”The young man had laid down his sketch-book and risen. His bushy\nlight-brown curls, as well as his youthfulness, identified him at once\nwith Celia’s apparition.“Dorothea, let me introduce to you my cousin, Mr. Ladislaw. Will, this\nis Miss Brooke.”The cousin was so close now, that, when he lifted his hat, Dorothea\ncould see a pair of gray eyes rather near together, a delicate\nirregular nose with a little ripple in it, and hair falling backward;\nbut there was a mouth and chin of a more prominent, threatening aspect\nthan belonged to the type of the grandmother’s miniature. Young\nLadislaw did not feel it necessary to smile, as if he were charmed with\nthis introduction to his future second cousin and her relatives; but\nwore rather a pouting air of discontent.“You are an artist, I see,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the sketch-book\nand turning it over in his unceremonious fashion.“No, I only sketch a little. There is nothing fit to be seen there,”\nsaid young Ladislaw, coloring, perhaps with temper rather than modesty."

  "content": "“Oh, come, this is a nice bit, now. I did a little in this way myself\nat one time, you know. Look here, now; this is what I call a nice\nthing, done with what we used to call _brio_.” Mr. Brooke held out\ntowards the two girls a large colored sketch of stony ground and trees,\nwith a pool.“I am no judge of these things,” said Dorothea, not coldly, but with an\neager deprecation of the appeal to her. “You know, uncle, I never see\nthe beauty of those pictures which you say are so much praised. They\nare a language I do not understand. I suppose there is some relation\nbetween pictures and nature which I am too ignorant to feel—just as you\nsee what a Greek sentence stands for which means nothing to me.”\nDorothea looked up at Mr. Casaubon, who bowed his head towards her,\nwhile Mr. Brooke said, smiling nonchalantly—“Bless me, now, how different people are! But you had a bad style of\nteaching, you know—else this is just the thing for girls—sketching,\nfine art and so on. But you took to drawing plans; you don’t understand\n_morbidezza_, and that kind of thing. You will come to my house, I\nhope, and I will show you what I did in this way,” he continued,\nturning to young Ladislaw, who had to be recalled from his\npreoccupation in observing Dorothea. Ladislaw had made up his mind that\nshe must be an unpleasant girl, since she was going to marry Casaubon,\nand what she said of her stupidity about pictures would have confirmed\nthat opinion even if he had believed her. As it was, he took her words\nfor a covert judgment, and was certain that she thought his sketch\ndetestable. There was too much cleverness in her apology: she was\nlaughing both at her uncle and himself. But what a voice! It was like\nthe voice of a soul that had once lived in an Aeolian harp. This must\nbe one of Nature’s inconsistencies. There could be no sort of passion\nin a girl who would marry Casaubon. But he turned from her, and bowed\nhis thanks for Mr. Brooke’s invitation."

  "content": "“We will turn over my Italian engravings together,” continued that\ngood-natured man. “I have no end of those things, that I have laid by\nfor years. One gets rusty in this part of the country, you know. Not\nyou, Casaubon; you stick to your studies; but my best ideas get\nundermost—out of use, you know. You clever young men must guard against\nindolence. I was too indolent, you know: else I might have been\nanywhere at one time.”“That is a seasonable admonition,” said Mr. Casaubon; “but now we will\npass on to the house, lest the young ladies should be tired of\nstanding.”When their backs were turned, young Ladislaw sat down to go on with his\nsketching, and as he did so his face broke into an expression of\namusement which increased as he went on drawing, till at last he threw\nback his head and laughed aloud. Partly it was the reception of his own\nartistic production that tickled him; partly the notion of his grave\ncousin as the lover of that girl; and partly Mr. Brooke’s definition of\nthe place he might have held but for the impediment of indolence. Mr.\nWill Ladislaw’s sense of the ludicrous lit up his features very\nagreeably: it was the pure enjoyment of comicality, and had no mixture\nof sneering and self-exaltation.“What is your nephew going to do with himself, Casaubon?” said Mr.\nBrooke, as they went on.“My cousin, you mean—not my nephew.”“Yes, yes, cousin. But in the way of a career, you know.”“The answer to that question is painfully doubtful. On leaving Rugby he\ndeclined to go to an English university, where I would gladly have\nplaced him, and chose what I must consider the anomalous course of\nstudying at Heidelberg. And now he wants to go abroad again, without\nany special object, save the vague purpose of what he calls culture,\npreparation for he knows not what. He declines to choose a profession.”“He has no means but what you furnish, I suppose.”“I have always given him and his friends reason to understand that I\nwould furnish in moderation what was necessary for providing him with a\nscholarly education, and launching him respectably. I am therefore\nbound to fulfil the expectation so raised,” said Mr. Casaubon, putting\nhis conduct in the light of mere rectitude: a trait of delicacy which\nDorothea noticed with admiration.“He has a thirst for travelling; perhaps he may turn out a Bruce or a\nMungo Park,” said Mr. Brooke. “I had a notion of that myself at one\ntime.”"

  "content": "“No, he has no bent towards exploration, or the enlargement of our\ngeognosis: that would be a special purpose which I could recognize with\nsome approbation, though without felicitating him on a career which so\noften ends in premature and violent death. But so far is he from having\nany desire for a more accurate knowledge of the earth’s surface, that\nhe said he should prefer not to know the sources of the Nile, and that\nthere should be some unknown regions preserved as hunting grounds for\nthe poetic imagination.”“Well, there is something in that, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, who had\ncertainly an impartial mind.“It is, I fear, nothing more than a part of his general inaccuracy and\nindisposition to thoroughness of all kinds, which would be a bad augury\nfor him in any profession, civil or sacred, even were he so far\nsubmissive to ordinary rule as to choose one.”“Perhaps he has conscientious scruples founded on his own unfitness,”\nsaid Dorothea, who was interesting herself in finding a favorable\nexplanation. “Because the law and medicine should be very serious\nprofessions to undertake, should they not? People’s lives and fortunes\ndepend on them.”“Doubtless; but I fear that my young relative Will Ladislaw is chiefly\ndetermined in his aversion to these callings by a dislike to steady\napplication, and to that kind of acquirement which is needful\ninstrumentally, but is not charming or immediately inviting to\nself-indulgent taste. I have insisted to him on what Aristotle has\nstated with admirable brevity, that for the achievement of any work\nregarded as an end there must be a prior exercise of many energies or\nacquired facilities of a secondary order, demanding patience. I have\npointed to my own manuscript volumes, which represent the toil of years\npreparatory to a work not yet accomplished. But in vain. To careful\nreasoning of this kind he replies by calling himself Pegasus, and every\nform of prescribed work ‘harness.’”Celia laughed. She was surprised to find that Mr. Casaubon could say\nsomething quite amusing.“Well, you know, he may turn out a Byron, a Chatterton, a\nChurchill—that sort of thing—there’s no telling,” said Mr. Brooke.\n“Shall you let him go to Italy, or wherever else he wants to go?”“Yes; I have agreed to furnish him with moderate supplies for a year or\nso; he asks no more. I shall let him be tried by the test of freedom.”"

After all, people may really have in them\nsome vocation which is not quite plain to themselves, may they not?\nThey may seem idle and weak because they are growing. We should be very\npatient with each other, I think.”“I suppose it is being engaged to be married that has made you think\npatience good,” said Celia, as soon as she and Dorothea were alone\ntogether, taking off their wrappings.“You mean that I am very impatient, Celia.”“Yes; when people don’t do and say just what you like.” Celia had\nbecome less afraid of “saying things” to Dorothea since this\nengagement: cleverness seemed to her more pitiable than ever.CHAPTER X.“He had catched a great cold, had he had no other clothes to wear than\nthe skin of a bear not yet killed.”—FULLER."

  "content": "Young Ladislaw did not pay that visit to which Mr. Brooke had invited\nhim, and only six days afterwards Mr. Casaubon mentioned that his young\nrelative had started for the Continent, seeming by this cold vagueness\nto waive inquiry. Indeed, Will had declined to fix on any more precise\ndestination than the entire area of Europe. Genius, he held, is\nnecessarily intolerant of fetters: on the one hand it must have the\nutmost play for its spontaneity; on the other, it may confidently await\nthose messages from the universe which summon it to its peculiar work,\nonly placing itself in an attitude of receptivity towards all sublime\nchances. The attitudes of receptivity are various, and Will had\nsincerely tried many of them. He was not excessively fond of wine, but\nhe had several times taken too much, simply as an experiment in that\nform of ecstasy; he had fasted till he was faint, and then supped on\nlobster; he had made himself ill with doses of opium. Nothing greatly\noriginal had resulted from these measures; and the effects of the opium\nhad convinced him that there was an entire dissimilarity between his\nconstitution and De Quincey’s. The superadded circumstance which would\nevolve the genius had not yet come; the universe had not yet beckoned.\nEven Caesar’s fortune at one time was but a grand presentiment. We know\nwhat a masquerade all development is, and what effective shapes may be\ndisguised in helpless embryos. In fact, the world is full of hopeful\nanalogies and handsome dubious eggs called possibilities. Will saw\nclearly enough the pitiable instances of long incubation producing no\nchick, and but for gratitude would have laughed at Casaubon, whose\nplodding application, rows of note-books, and small taper of learned\ntheory exploring the tossed ruins of the world, seemed to enforce a\nmoral entirely encouraging to Will’s generous reliance on the\nintentions of the universe with regard to himself. He held that\nreliance to be a mark of genius; and certainly it is no mark to the\ncontrary; genius consisting neither in self-conceit nor in humility,\nbut in a power to make or do, not anything in general, but something in\nparticular. Let him start for the Continent, then, without our\npronouncing on his future. Among all forms of mistake, prophecy is the\nmost gratuitous."

  "content": "But at present this caution against a too hasty judgment interests me\nmore in relation to Mr. Casaubon than to his young cousin. If to\nDorothea Mr. Casaubon had been the mere occasion which had set alight\nthe fine inflammable material of her youthful illusions, does it follow\nthat he was fairly represented in the minds of those less impassioned\npersonages who have hitherto delivered their judgments concerning him?\nI protest against any absolute conclusion, any prejudice derived from\nMrs. Cadwallader’s contempt for a neighboring clergyman’s alleged\ngreatness of soul, or Sir James Chettam’s poor opinion of his rival’s\nlegs,—from Mr. Brooke’s failure to elicit a companion’s ideas, or from\nCelia’s criticism of a middle-aged scholar’s personal appearance. I am\nnot sure that the greatest man of his age, if ever that solitary\nsuperlative existed, could escape these unfavorable reflections of\nhimself in various small mirrors; and even Milton, looking for his\nportrait in a spoon, must submit to have the facial angle of a bumpkin.\nMoreover, if Mr. Casaubon, speaking for himself, has rather a chilling\nrhetoric, it is not therefore certain that there is no good work or\nfine feeling in him. Did not an immortal physicist and interpreter of\nhieroglyphs write detestable verses? Has the theory of the solar system\nbeen advanced by graceful manners and conversational tact? Suppose we\nturn from outside estimates of a man, to wonder, with keener interest,\nwhat is the report of his own consciousness about his doings or\ncapacity: with what hindrances he is carrying on his daily labors; what\nfading of hopes, or what deeper fixity of self-delusion the years are\nmarking off within him; and with what spirit he wrestles against\nuniversal pressure, which will one day be too heavy for him, and bring\nhis heart to its final pause. Doubtless his lot is important in his own\neyes; and the chief reason that we think he asks too large a place in\nour consideration must be our want of room for him, since we refer him\nto the Divine regard with perfect confidence; nay, it is even held\nsublime for our neighbor to expect the utmost there, however little he\nmay have got from us. Mr. Casaubon, too, was the centre of his own\nworld; if he was liable to think that others were providentially made\nfor him, and especially to consider them in the light of their fitness\nfor the author of a “Key to all Mythologies,” this trait is not quite\nalien to us, and, like the other mendicant hopes of mortals, claims\nsome of our pity."

For in truth, as the day fixed\nfor his marriage came nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not find his spirits\nrising; nor did the contemplation of that matrimonial garden scene,\nwhere, as all experience showed, the path was to be bordered with\nflowers, prove persistently more enchanting to him than the accustomed\nvaults where he walked taper in hand. He did not confess to himself,\nstill less could he have breathed to another, his surprise that though\nhe had won a lovely and noble-hearted girl he had not won\ndelight,—which he had also regarded as an object to be found by search.\nIt is true that he knew all the classical passages implying the\ncontrary; but knowing classical passages, we find, is a mode of motion,\nwhich explains why they leave so little extra force for their personal\napplication."

  "content": "Poor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his long studious bachelorhood had\nstored up for him a compound interest of enjoyment, and that large\ndrafts on his affections would not fail to be honored; for we all of\nus, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act\nfatally on the strength of them. And now he was in danger of being\nsaddened by the very conviction that his circumstances were unusually\nhappy: there was nothing external by which he could account for a\ncertain blankness of sensibility which came over him just when his\nexpectant gladness should have been most lively, just when he exchanged\nthe accustomed dulness of his Lowick library for his visits to the\nGrange. Here was a weary experience in which he was as utterly\ncondemned to loneliness as in the despair which sometimes threatened\nhim while toiling in the morass of authorship without seeming nearer to\nthe goal. And his was that worst loneliness which would shrink from\nsympathy. He could not but wish that Dorothea should think him not less\nhappy than the world would expect her successful suitor to be; and in\nrelation to his authorship he leaned on her young trust and veneration,\nhe liked to draw forth her fresh interest in listening, as a means of\nencouragement to himself: in talking to her he presented all his\nperformance and intention with the reflected confidence of the\npedagogue, and rid himself for the time of that chilling ideal audience\nwhich crowded his laborious uncreative hours with the vaporous pressure\nof Tartarean shades.For to Dorothea, after that toy-box history of the world adapted to\nyoung ladies which had made the chief part of her education, Mr.\nCasaubon’s talk about his great book was full of new vistas; and this\nsense of revelation, this surprise of a nearer introduction to Stoics\nand Alexandrians, as people who had ideas not totally unlike her own,\nkept in abeyance for the time her usual eagerness for a binding theory\nwhich could bring her own life and doctrine into strict connection with\nthat amazing past, and give the remotest sources of knowledge some\nbearing on her actions. That more complete teaching would come—Mr.\nCasaubon would tell her all that: she was looking forward to higher\ninitiation in ideas, as she was looking forward to marriage, and\nblending her dim conceptions of both. It would be a great mistake to\nsuppose that Dorothea would have cared about any share in Mr.\nCasaubon’s learning as mere accomplishment; for though opinion in the\nneighborhood of Freshitt and Tipton had pronounced her clever, that\nepithet would not have described her to circles in whose more precise\nvocabulary cleverness implies mere aptitude for knowing and doing,\napart from character. All her eagerness for acquirement lay within that\nfull current of sympathetic motive in which her ideas and impulses were\nhabitually swept along. She did not want to deck herself with\nknowledge—to wear it loose from the nerves and blood that fed her\naction; and if she had written a book she must have done it as Saint\nTheresa did, under the command of an authority that constrained her\nconscience. But something she yearned for by which her life might be\nfilled with action at once rational and ardent; and since the time was\ngone by for guiding visions and spiritual directors, since prayer\nheightened yearning but not instruction, what lamp was there but\nknowledge? Surely learned men kept the only oil; and who more learned\nthan Mr. Casaubon?"

For the\nfirst time in speaking to Mr. Casaubon she colored from annoyance.“You must have misunderstood me very much,” she said, “if you think I\nshould not enter into the value of your time—if you think that I should\nnot willingly give up whatever interfered with your using it to the\nbest purpose.”“That is very amiable in you, my dear Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon, not\nin the least noticing that she was hurt; “but if you had a lady as your\ncompanion, I could put you both under the care of a cicerone, and we\ncould thus achieve two purposes in the same space of time.”“I beg you will not refer to this again,” said Dorothea, rather\nhaughtily. But immediately she feared that she was wrong, and turning\ntowards him she laid her hand on his, adding in a different tone, “Pray\ndo not be anxious about me. I shall have so much to think of when I am\nalone. And Tantripp will be a sufficient companion, just to take care\nof me. I could not bear to have Celia: she would be miserable.”"

There was to be a dinner-party that day, the last\nof the parties which were held at the Grange as proper preliminaries to\nthe wedding, and Dorothea was glad of a reason for moving away at once\non the sound of the bell, as if she needed more than her usual amount\nof preparation. She was ashamed of being irritated from some cause she\ncould not define even to herself; for though she had no intention to be\nuntruthful, her reply had not touched the real hurt within her. Mr.\nCasaubon’s words had been quite reasonable, yet they had brought a\nvague instantaneous sense of aloofness on his part.“Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind,” she said to\nherself. “How can I have a husband who is so much above me without\nknowing that he needs me less than I need him?”Having convinced herself that Mr. Casaubon was altogether right, she\nrecovered her equanimity, and was an agreeable image of serene dignity\nwhen she came into the drawing-room in her silver-gray dress—the simple\nlines of her dark-brown hair parted over her brow and coiled massively\nbehind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and\nexpression of all search after mere effect. Sometimes when Dorothea was\nin company, there seemed to be as complete an air of repose about her\nas if she had been a picture of Santa Barbara looking out from her\ntower into the clear air; but these intervals of quietude made the\nenergy of her speech and emotion the more remarked when some outward\nappeal had touched her."

  "content": "She was naturally the subject of many observations this evening, for\nthe dinner-party was large and rather more miscellaneous as to the male\nportion than any which had been held at the Grange since Mr. Brooke’s\nnieces had resided with him, so that the talking was done in duos and\ntrios more or less inharmonious. There was the newly elected mayor of\nMiddlemarch, who happened to be a manufacturer; the philanthropic\nbanker his brother-in-law, who predominated so much in the town that\nsome called him a Methodist, others a hypocrite, according to the\nresources of their vocabulary; and there were various professional men.\nIn fact, Mrs. Cadwallader said that Brooke was beginning to treat the\nMiddlemarchers, and that she preferred the farmers at the tithe-dinner,\nwho drank her health unpretentiously, and were not ashamed of their\ngrandfathers’ furniture. For in that part of the country, before reform\nhad done its notable part in developing the political consciousness,\nthere was a clearer distinction of ranks and a dimmer distinction of\nparties; so that Mr. Brooke’s miscellaneous invitations seemed to\nbelong to that general laxity which came from his inordinate travel and\nhabit of taking too much in the form of ideas.Already, as Miss Brooke passed out of the dining-room, opportunity was\nfound for some interjectional “asides.”“A fine woman, Miss Brooke! an uncommonly fine woman, by God!” said Mr.\nStandish, the old lawyer, who had been so long concerned with the\nlanded gentry that he had become landed himself, and used that oath in\na deep-mouthed manner as a sort of armorial bearings, stamping the\nspeech of a man who held a good position.Mr. Bulstrode, the banker, seemed to be addressed, but that gentleman\ndisliked coarseness and profanity, and merely bowed. The remark was\ntaken up by Mr. Chichely, a middle-aged bachelor and coursing\ncelebrity, who had a complexion something like an Easter egg, a few\nhairs carefully arranged, and a carriage implying the consciousness of\na distinguished appearance.“Yes, but not my style of woman: I like a woman who lays herself out a\nlittle more to please us. There should be a little filigree about a\nwoman—something of the coquette. A man likes a sort of challenge. The\nmore of a dead set she makes at you the better.”“There’s some truth in that,” said Mr. Standish, disposed to be genial.\n“And, by God, it’s usually the way with them. I suppose it answers some\nwise ends: Providence made them so, eh, Bulstrode?”“I should be disposed to refer coquetry to another source,” said Mr.\nBulstrode. “I should rather refer it to the devil.”“Ay, to be sure, there should be a little devil in a woman,” said Mr.\nChichely, whose study of the fair sex seemed to have been detrimental\nto his theology. “And I like them blond, with a certain gait, and a\nswan neck. Between ourselves, the mayor’s daughter is more to my taste\nthan Miss Brooke or Miss Celia either. If I were a marrying man I\nshould choose Miss Vincy before either of them.”“Well, make up, make up,” said Mr. Standish, jocosely; “you see the\nmiddle-aged fellows carry the day.”Mr. Chichely shook his head with much meaning: he was not going to\nincur the certainty of being accepted by the woman he would choose."

The\nfeminine part of the company included none whom Lady Chettam or Mrs.\nCadwallader could object to; for Mrs. Renfrew, the colonel’s widow, was\nnot only unexceptionable in point of breeding, but also interesting on\nthe ground of her complaint, which puzzled the doctors, and seemed\nclearly a case wherein the fulness of professional knowledge might need\nthe supplement of quackery. Lady Chettam, who attributed her own\nremarkable health to home-made bitters united with constant medical\nattendance, entered with much exercise of the imagination into Mrs.\nRenfrew’s account of symptoms, and into the amazing futility in her\ncase of all strengthening medicines.“Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?” said the\nmild but stately dowager, turning to Mrs. Cadwallader reflectively,\nwhen Mrs. Renfrew’s attention was called away.“It strengthens the disease,” said the Rector’s wife, much too\nwell-born not to be an amateur in medicine. “Everything depends on the\nconstitution: some people make fat, some blood, and some bile—that’s my\nview of the matter; and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the\nmill.”“Then she ought to take medicines that would reduce—reduce the disease,\nyou know, if you are right, my dear. And I think what you say is\nreasonable.”“Certainly it is reasonable. You have two sorts of potatoes, fed on the\nsame soil. One of them grows more and more watery—”“Ah! like this poor Mrs. Renfrew—that is what I think. Dropsy! There is\nno swelling yet—it is inward. I should say she ought to take drying\nmedicines, shouldn’t you?—or a dry hot-air bath. Many things might be\ntried, of a drying nature.”“Let her try a certain person’s pamphlets,” said Mrs. Cadwallader in an\nundertone, seeing the gentlemen enter. “He does not want drying.”“Who, my dear?” said Lady Chettam, a charming woman, not so quick as to\nnullify the pleasure of explanation.“The bridegroom—Casaubon. He has certainly been drying up faster since\nthe engagement: the flame of passion, I suppose.”“I should think he is far from having a good constitution,” said Lady\nChettam, with a still deeper undertone. “And then his studies—so very\ndry, as you say.”“Really, by the side of Sir James, he looks like a death’s head skinned\nover for the occasion. Mark my words: in a year from this time that\ngirl will hate him. She looks up to him as an oracle now, and by-and-by\nshe will be at the other extreme. All flightiness!”“How very shocking! I fear she is headstrong. But tell me—you know all\nabout him—is there anything very bad? What is the truth?”“The truth? he is as bad as the wrong physic—nasty to take, and sure to\ndisagree.”"

He says she is the mirror of\nwomen still.”“That is a generous make-believe of his. Depend upon it, he likes\nlittle Celia better, and she appreciates him. I hope you like my little\nCelia?”“Certainly; she is fonder of geraniums, and seems more docile, though\nnot so fine a figure. But we were talking of physic. Tell me about this\nnew young surgeon, Mr. Lydgate. I am told he is wonderfully clever: he\ncertainly looks it—a fine brow indeed.”“He is a gentleman. I heard him talking to Humphrey. He talks well.”“Yes. Mr. Brooke says he is one of the Lydgates of Northumberland,\nreally well connected. One does not expect it in a practitioner of that\nkind. For my own part, I like a medical man more on a footing with the\nservants; they are often all the cleverer. I assure you I found poor\nHicks’s judgment unfailing; I never knew him wrong. He was coarse and\nbutcher-like, but he knew my constitution. It was a loss to me his\ngoing off so suddenly. Dear me, what a very animated conversation Miss\nBrooke seems to be having with this Mr. Lydgate!”“She is talking cottages and hospitals with him,” said Mrs.\nCadwallader, whose ears and power of interpretation were quick. “I\nbelieve he is a sort of philanthropist, so Brooke is sure to take him\nup.”“James,” said Lady Chettam when her son came near, “bring Mr. Lydgate\nand introduce him to me. I want to test him.”The affable dowager declared herself delighted with this opportunity of\nmaking Mr. Lydgate’s acquaintance, having heard of his success in\ntreating fever on a new plan."

He was as little as possible like the\nlamented Hicks, especially in a certain careless refinement about his\ntoilet and utterance. Yet Lady Chettam gathered much confidence in him.\nHe confirmed her view of her own constitution as being peculiar, by\nadmitting that all constitutions might be called peculiar, and he did\nnot deny that hers might be more peculiar than others. He did not\napprove of a too lowering system, including reckless cupping, nor, on\nthe other hand, of incessant port wine and bark. He said “I think so”\nwith an air of so much deference accompanying the insight of agreement,\nthat she formed the most cordial opinion of his talents.“I am quite pleased with your protege,” she said to Mr. Brooke before\ngoing away.“My protege?—dear me!—who is that?” said Mr. Brooke.“This young Lydgate, the new doctor. He seems to me to understand his\nprofession admirably.”“Oh, Lydgate! he is not my protege, you know; only I knew an uncle of\nhis who sent me a letter about him. However, I think he is likely to be\nfirst-rate—has studied in Paris, knew Broussais; has ideas, you\nknow—wants to raise the profession.”“Lydgate has lots of ideas, quite new, about ventilation and diet, that\nsort of thing,” resumed Mr. Brooke, after he had handed out Lady\nChettam, and had returned to be civil to a group of Middlemarchers.“Hang it, do you think that is quite sound?—upsetting the old\ntreatment, which has made Englishmen what they are?” said Mr. Standish.“Medical knowledge is at a low ebb among us,” said Mr. Bulstrode, who\nspoke in a subdued tone, and had rather a sickly air. “I, for my part,\nhail the advent of Mr. Lydgate. I hope to find good reason for\nconfiding the new hospital to his management.”“That is all very fine,” replied Mr. Standish, who was not fond of Mr.\nBulstrode; “if you like him to try experiments on your hospital\npatients, and kill a few people for charity I have no objection. But I\nam not going to hand money out of my purse to have experiments tried on\nme. I like treatment that has been tested a little.”“Well, you know, Standish, every dose you take is an experiment-an\nexperiment, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding towards the lawyer.“Oh, if you talk in that sense!” said Mr. Standish, with as much\ndisgust at such non-legal quibbling as a man can well betray towards a\nvaluable client."

He had quitted the party\nearly, and would have thought it altogether tedious but for the novelty\nof certain introductions, especially the introduction to Miss Brooke,\nwhose youthful bloom, with her approaching marriage to that faded\nscholar, and her interest in matters socially useful, gave her the\npiquancy of an unusual combination.“She is a good creature—that fine girl—but a little too earnest,” he\nthought. “It is troublesome to talk to such women. They are always\nwanting reasons, yet they are too ignorant to understand the merits of\nany question, and usually fall back on their moral sense to settle\nthings after their own taste.”Evidently Miss Brooke was not Mr. Lydgate’s style of woman any more\nthan Mr. Chichely’s. Considered, indeed, in relation to the latter,\nwhose mind was matured, she was altogether a mistake, and calculated to\nshock his trust in final causes, including the adaptation of fine young\nwomen to purplefaced bachelors. But Lydgate was less ripe, and might\npossibly have experience before him which would modify his opinion as\nto the most excellent things in woman.Miss Brooke, however, was not again seen by either of these gentlemen\nunder her maiden name. Not long after that dinner-party she had become\nMrs. Casaubon, and was on her way to Rome.CHAPTER XI.But deeds and language such as men do use,\nAnd persons such as comedy would choose,\nWhen she would show an image of the times,\nAnd sport with human follies, not with crimes.\n—BEN JONSON."

  "content": "Lydgate, in fact, was already conscious of being fascinated by a woman\nstrikingly different from Miss Brooke: he did not in the least suppose\nthat he had lost his balance and fallen in love, but he had said of\nthat particular woman, “She is grace itself; she is perfectly lovely\nand accomplished. That is what a woman ought to be: she ought to\nproduce the effect of exquisite music.” Plain women he regarded as he\ndid the other severe facts of life, to be faced with philosophy and\ninvestigated by science. But Rosamond Vincy seemed to have the true\nmelodic charm; and when a man has seen the woman whom he would have\nchosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor\nwill usually depend on her resolution rather than on his. Lydgate\nbelieved that he should not marry for several years: not marry until he\nhad trodden out a good clear path for himself away from the broad road\nwhich was quite ready made. He had seen Miss Vincy above his horizon\nalmost as long as it had taken Mr. Casaubon to become engaged and\nmarried: but this learned gentleman was possessed of a fortune; he had\nassembled his voluminous notes, and had made that sort of reputation\nwhich precedes performance,—often the larger part of a man’s fame. He\ntook a wife, as we have seen, to adorn the remaining quadrant of his\ncourse, and be a little moon that would cause hardly a calculable\nperturbation. But Lydgate was young, poor, ambitious. He had his\nhalf-century before him instead of behind him, and he had come to\nMiddlemarch bent on doing many things that were not directly fitted to\nmake his fortune or even secure him a good income. To a man under such\ncircumstances, taking a wife is something more than a question of\nadornment, however highly he may rate this; and Lydgate was disposed to\ngive it the first place among wifely functions. To his taste, guided by\na single conversation, here was the point on which Miss Brooke would be\nfound wanting, notwithstanding her undeniable beauty. She did not look\nat things from the proper feminine angle. The society of such women was\nabout as relaxing as going from your work to teach the second form,\ninstead of reclining in a paradise with sweet laughs for bird-notes,\nand blue eyes for a heaven."

Some slipped a little downward,\nsome got higher footing: people denied aspirates, gained wealth, and\nfastidious gentlemen stood for boroughs; some were caught in political\ncurrents, some in ecclesiastical, and perhaps found themselves\nsurprisingly grouped in consequence; while a few personages or families\nthat stood with rocky firmness amid all this fluctuation, were slowly\npresenting new aspects in spite of solidity, and altering with the\ndouble change of self and beholder. Municipal town and rural parish\ngradually made fresh threads of connection—gradually, as the old\nstocking gave way to the savings-bank, and the worship of the solar\nguinea became extinct; while squires and baronets, and even lords who\nhad once lived blamelessly afar from the civic mind, gathered the\nfaultiness of closer acquaintanceship. Settlers, too, came from distant\ncounties, some with an alarming novelty of skill, others with an\noffensive advantage in cunning. In fact, much the same sort of movement\nand mixture went on in old England as we find in older Herodotus, who\nalso, in telling what had been, thought it well to take a woman’s lot\nfor his starting-point; though Io, as a maiden apparently beguiled by\nattractive merchandise, was the reverse of Miss Brooke, and in this\nrespect perhaps bore more resemblance to Rosamond Vincy, who had\nexcellent taste in costume, with that nymph-like figure and pure\nblondness which give the largest range to choice in the flow and color\nof drapery. But these things made only part of her charm. She was\nadmitted to be the flower of Mrs. Lemon’s school, the chief school in\nthe county, where the teaching included all that was demanded in the\naccomplished female—even to extras, such as the getting in and out of a\ncarriage. Mrs. Lemon herself had always held up Miss Vincy as an\nexample: no pupil, she said, exceeded that young lady for mental\nacquisition and propriety of speech, while her musical execution was\nquite exceptional. We cannot help the way in which people speak of us,\nand probably if Mrs. Lemon had undertaken to describe Juliet or Imogen,\nthese heroines would not have seemed poetical. The first vision of\nRosamond would have been enough with most judges to dispel any\nprejudice excited by Mrs. Lemon’s praise."

For who of any consequence in Middlemarch was not\nconnected or at least acquainted with the Vincys? They were old\nmanufacturers, and had kept a good house for three generations, in\nwhich there had naturally been much intermarrying with neighbors more\nor less decidedly genteel. Mr. Vincy’s sister had made a wealthy match\nin accepting Mr. Bulstrode, who, however, as a man not born in the\ntown, and altogether of dimly known origin, was considered to have done\nwell in uniting himself with a real Middlemarch family; on the other\nhand, Mr. Vincy had descended a little, having taken an innkeeper’s\ndaughter. But on this side too there was a cheering sense of money; for\nMrs. Vincy’s sister had been second wife to rich old Mr. Featherstone,\nand had died childless years ago, so that her nephews and nieces might\nbe supposed to touch the affections of the widower. And it happened\nthat Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Featherstone, two of Peacock’s most\nimportant patients, had, from different causes, given an especially\ngood reception to his successor, who had raised some partisanship as\nwell as discussion. Mr. Wrench, medical attendant to the Vincy family,\nvery early had grounds for thinking lightly of Lydgate’s professional\ndiscretion, and there was no report about him which was not retailed at\nthe Vincys’, where visitors were frequent. Mr. Vincy was more inclined\nto general good-fellowship than to taking sides, but there was no need\nfor him to be hasty in making any new man acquaintance. Rosamond\nsilently wished that her father would invite Mr. Lydgate. She was tired\nof the faces and figures she had always been used to—the various\nirregular profiles and gaits and turns of phrase distinguishing those\nMiddlemarch young men whom she had known as boys. She had been at\nschool with girls of higher position, whose brothers, she felt sure, it\nwould have been possible for her to be more interested in, than in\nthese inevitable Middlemarch companions. But she would not have chosen\nto mention her wish to her father; and he, for his part, was in no\nhurry on the subject.

This was the case one\nmorning of the October in which we have lately seen Mr. Casaubon\nvisiting the Grange; and though the room was a little overheated with\nthe fire, which had sent the spaniel panting to a remote corner,\nRosamond, for some reason, continued to sit at her embroidery longer\nthan usual, now and then giving herself a little shake, and laying her\nwork on her knee to contemplate it with an air of hesitating weariness.\nHer mamma, who had returned from an excursion to the kitchen, sat on\nthe other side of the small work-table with an air of more entire\nplacidity, until, the clock again giving notice that it was going to\nstrike, she looked up from the lace-mending which was occupying her\nplump fingers and rang the bell.“Knock at Mr. Fred’s door again, Pritchard, and tell him it has struck\nhalf-past ten.”This was said without any change in the radiant good-humor of Mrs.\nVincy’s face, in which forty-five years had delved neither angles nor\nparallels; and pushing back her pink capstrings, she let her work rest\non her lap, while she looked admiringly at her daughter.“Mamma,” said Rosamond, “when Fred comes down I wish you would not let\nhim have red herrings.
