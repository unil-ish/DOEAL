  "content": "How this came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic or\nknowledge of prices. When a man in setting up a house and preparing for\nmarriage finds that his furniture and other initial expenses come to\nbetween four and five hundred pounds more than he has capital to pay\nfor; when at the end of a year it appears that his household expenses,\nhorses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a thousand, while the proceeds\nof the practice reckoned from the old books to be worth eight hundred\nper annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five hundred,\nchiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he\nminds it or not, he is in debt. Those were less expensive times than\nour own, and provincial life was comparatively modest; but the ease\nwith which a medical man who had lately bought a practice, who thought\nthat he was obliged to keep two horses, whose table was supplied\nwithout stint, and who paid an insurance on his life and a high rent\nfor house and garden, might find his expenses doubling his receipts,\ncan be conceived by any one who does not think these details beneath\nhis consideration. Rosamond, accustomed from her childhood to an\nextravagant household, thought that good housekeeping consisted simply\nin ordering the best of everything—nothing else “answered;” and Lydgate\nsupposed that “if things were done at all, they must be done\nproperly”—he did not see how they were to live otherwise. If each head\nof household expenditure had been mentioned to him beforehand, he would\nhave probably observed that “it could hardly come to much,” and if any\none had suggested a saving on a particular article—for example, the\nsubstitution of cheap fish for dear—it would have appeared to him\nsimply a penny-wise, mean notion. Rosamond, even without such an\noccasion as Captain Lydgate’s visit, was fond of giving invitations,\nand Lydgate, though he often thought the guests tiresome, did not\ninterfere. This sociability seemed a necessary part of professional\nprudence, and the entertainment must be suitable. It is true Lydgate\nwas constantly visiting the homes of the poor and adjusting his\nprescriptions of diet to their small means; but, dear me! has it not by\nthis time ceased to be remarkable—is it not rather that we expect in\nmen, that they should have numerous strands of experience lying side by\nside and never compare them with each other? Expenditure—like ugliness\nand errors—becomes a totally new thing when we attach our own\npersonality to it, and measure it by that wide difference which is\nmanifest (in our own sensations) between ourselves and others. Lydgate\nbelieved himself to be careless about his dress, and he despised a man\nwho calculated the effects of his costume; it seemed to him only a\nmatter of course that he had abundance of fresh garments—such things\nwere naturally ordered in sheaves. It must be remembered that he had\nnever hitherto felt the check of importunate debt, and he walked by\nhabit, not by self-criticism. But the check had come."

  "content": "Its novelty made it the more irritating. He was amazed, disgusted that\nconditions so foreign to all his purposes, so hatefully disconnected\nwith the objects he cared to occupy himself with, should have lain in\nambush and clutched him when he was unaware. And there was not only the\nactual debt; there was the certainty that in his present position he\nmust go on deepening it. Two furnishing tradesmen at Brassing, whose\nbills had been incurred before his marriage, and whom uncalculated\ncurrent expenses had ever since prevented him from paying, had\nrepeatedly sent him unpleasant letters which had forced themselves on\nhis attention. This could hardly have been more galling to any\ndisposition than to Lydgate’s, with his intense pride—his dislike of\nasking a favor or being under an obligation to any one. He had scorned\neven to form conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters,\nand nothing but extremity could have induced him to apply to his\nfather-in-law, even if he had not been made aware in various indirect\nways since his marriage that Mr. Vincy’s own affairs were not\nflourishing, and that the expectation of help from him would be\nresented. Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it had\nnever in the former part of his life occurred to Lydgate that he should\nneed to do so: he had never thought what borrowing would be to him; but\nnow that the idea had entered his mind, he felt that he would rather\nincur any other hardship. In the mean time he had no money or prospects\nof money; and his practice was not getting more lucrative."

  "content": "No wonder that Lydgate had been unable to suppress all signs of inward\ntrouble during the last few months, and now that Rosamond was regaining\nbrilliant health, he meditated taking her entirely into confidence on\nhis difficulties. New conversance with tradesmen’s bills had forced his\nreasoning into a new channel of comparison: he had begun to consider\nfrom a new point of view what was necessary and unnecessary in goods\nordered, and to see that there must be some change of habits. How could\nsuch a change be made without Rosamond’s concurrence? The immediate\noccasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her was forced upon him.Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security\ncould possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate had offered\nthe one good security in his power to the less peremptory creditor, who\nwas a silversmith and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself\nthe upholsterer’s credit also, accepting interest for a given term. The\nsecurity necessary was a bill of sale on the furniture of his house,\nwhich might make a creditor easy for a reasonable time about a debt\namounting to less than four hundred pounds; and the silversmith, Mr.\nDover, was willing to reduce it by taking back a portion of the plate\nand any other article which was as good as new. “Any other article” was\na phrase delicately implying jewellery, and more particularly some\npurple amethysts costing thirty pounds, which Lydgate had bought as a\nbridal present.Opinions may be divided as to his wisdom in making this present: some\nmay think that it was a graceful attention to be expected from a man\nlike Lydgate, and that the fault of any troublesome consequences lay in\nthe pinched narrowness of provincial life at that time, which offered\nno conveniences for professional people whose fortune was not\nproportioned to their tastes; also, in Lydgate’s ridiculous\nfastidiousness about asking his friends for money."

  "content": "However, it had seemed a question of no moment to him on that fine\nmorning when he went to give a final order for plate: in the presence\nof other jewels enormously expensive, and as an addition to orders of\nwhich the amount had not been exactly calculated, thirty pounds for\nornaments so exquisitely suited to Rosamond’s neck and arms could\nhardly appear excessive when there was no ready cash for it to exceed.\nBut at this crisis Lydgate’s imagination could not help dwelling on the\npossibility of letting the amethysts take their place again among Mr.\nDover’s stock, though he shrank from the idea of proposing this to\nRosamond. Having been roused to discern consequences which he had never\nbeen in the habit of tracing, he was preparing to act on this\ndiscernment with some of the rigor (by no means all) that he would have\napplied in pursuing experiment. He was nerving himself to this rigor as\nhe rode from Brassing, and meditated on the representations he must\nmake to Rosamond.It was evening when he got home. He was intensely miserable, this\nstrong man of nine-and-twenty and of many gifts. He was not saying\nangrily within himself that he had made a profound mistake; but the\nmistake was at work in him like a recognized chronic disease, mingling\nits uneasy importunities with every prospect, and enfeebling every\nthought. As he went along the passage to the drawing-room, he heard the\npiano and singing. Of course, Ladislaw was there. It was some weeks\nsince Will had parted from Dorothea, yet he was still at the old post\nin Middlemarch. Lydgate had no objection in general to Ladislaw’s\ncoming, but just now he was annoyed that he could not find his hearth\nfree. When he opened the door the two singers went on towards the\nkey-note, raising their eyes and looking at him indeed, but not\nregarding his entrance as an interruption. To a man galled with his\nharness as poor Lydgate was, it is not soothing to see two people\nwarbling at him, as he comes in with the sense that the painful day has\nstill pains in store. His face, already paler than usual, took on a\nscowl as he walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.The singers feeling themselves excused by the fact that they had only\nthree bars to sing, now turned round.“How are you, Lydgate?” said Will, coming forward to shake hands.Lydgate took his hand, but did not think it necessary to speak.“Have you dined, Tertius? I expected you much earlier,” said Rosamond,\nwho had already seen that her husband was in a “horrible humor.” She\nseated herself in her usual place as she spoke.“I have dined. I should like some tea, please,” said Lydgate, curtly,\nstill scowling and looking markedly at his legs stretched out before\nhim.Will was too quick to need more. “I shall be off,” he said, reaching\nhis hat.“Tea is coming,” said Rosamond; “pray don’t go.”"

  "content": "“Yes, Lydgate is bored,” said Will, who had more comprehension of\nLydgate than Rosamond had, and was not offended by his manner, easily\nimagining outdoor causes of annoyance.“There is the more need for you to stay,” said Rosamond, playfully, and\nin her lightest accent; “he will not speak to me all the evening.”“Yes, Rosamond, I shall,” said Lydgate, in his strong baritone. “I have\nsome serious business to speak to you about.”No introduction of the business could have been less like that which\nLydgate had intended; but her indifferent manner had been too\nprovoking.“There! you see,” said Will. “I’m going to the meeting about the\nMechanics’ Institute. Good-by;” and he went quickly out of the room."

  "content": "Rosamond did not look at her husband, but presently rose and took her\nplace before the tea-tray. She was thinking that she had never seen him\nso disagreeable. Lydgate turned his dark eyes on her and watched her as\nshe delicately handled the tea-service with her taper fingers, and\nlooked at the objects immediately before her with no curve in her face\ndisturbed, and yet with an ineffable protest in her air against all\npeople with unpleasant manners. For the moment he lost the sense of his\nwound in a sudden speculation about this new form of feminine\nimpassibility revealing itself in the sylph-like frame which he had\nonce interpreted as the sign of a ready intelligent sensitiveness. His\nmind glancing back to Laure while he looked at Rosamond, he said\ninwardly, “Would _she_ kill me because I wearied her?” and then, “It is\nthe way with all women.” But this power of generalizing which gives men\nso much the superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was\nimmediately thwarted by Lydgate’s memory of wondering impressions from\nthe behavior of another woman—from Dorothea’s looks and tones of\nemotion about her husband when Lydgate began to attend him—from her\npassionate cry to be taught what would best comfort that man for whose\nsake it seemed as if she must quell every impulse in her except the\nyearnings of faithfulness and compassion. These revived impressions\nsucceeded each other quickly and dreamily in Lydgate’s mind while the\ntea was being brewed. He had shut his eyes in the last instant of\nreverie while he heard Dorothea saying, “Advise me—think what I can\ndo—he has been all his life laboring and looking forward. He minds\nabout nothing else—and I mind about nothing else.”That voice of deep-souled womanhood had remained within him as the\nenkindling conceptions of dead and sceptred genius had remained within\nhim (is there not a genius for feeling nobly which also reigns over\nhuman spirits and their conclusions?); the tones were a music from\nwhich he was falling away—he had really fallen into a momentary doze,\nwhen Rosamond said in her silvery neutral way, “Here is your tea,\nTertius,” setting it on the small table by his side, and then moved\nback to her place without looking at him. Lydgate was too hasty in\nattributing insensibility to her; after her own fashion, she was\nsensitive enough, and took lasting impressions. Her impression now was\none of offence and repulsion. But then, Rosamond had no scowls and had\nnever raised her voice: she was quite sure that no one could justly\nfind fault with her.Perhaps Lydgate and she had never felt so far off each other before;\nbut there were strong reasons for not deferring his revelation, even if\nhe had not already begun it by that abrupt announcement; indeed some of\nthe angry desire to rouse her into more sensibility on his account\nwhich had prompted him to speak prematurely, still mingled with his\npain in the prospect of her pain. But he waited till the tray was gone,\nthe candles were lit, and the evening quiet might be counted on: the\ninterval had left time for repelled tenderness to return into the old\ncourse. He spoke kindly.“Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,” he said, gently,\npushing away the table, and stretching out his arm to draw a chair near\nhis own."

  "content": "Rosamond obeyed. As she came towards him in her drapery of transparent\nfaintly tinted muslin, her slim yet round figure never looked more\ngraceful; as she sat down by him and laid one hand on the elbow of his\nchair, at last looking at him and meeting his eyes, her delicate neck\nand cheek and purely cut lips never had more of that untarnished beauty\nwhich touches as in spring-time and infancy and all sweet freshness. It\ntouched Lydgate now, and mingled the early moments of his love for her\nwith all the other memories which were stirred in this crisis of deep\ntrouble. He laid his ample hand softly on hers, saying—“Dear!” with the lingering utterance which affection gives to the word.\nRosamond too was still under the power of that same past, and her\nhusband was still in part the Lydgate whose approval had stirred\ndelight. She put his hair lightly away from his forehead, then laid her\nother hand on his, and was conscious of forgiving him.“I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you, Rosy. But there are\nthings which husband and wife must think of together. I dare say it has\noccurred to you already that I am short of money.”Lydgate paused; but Rosamond turned her neck and looked at a vase on\nthe mantel-piece.“I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were\nmarried, and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged\nto meet. The consequence is, there is a large debt at Brassing—three\nhundred and eighty pounds—which has been pressing on me a good while,\nand in fact we are getting deeper every day, for people don’t pay me\nthe faster because others want the money. I took pains to keep it from\nyou while you were not well; but now we must think together about it,\nand you must help me.”“What can _I_ do, Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning her eyes on him\nagain. That little speech of four words, like so many others in all\nlanguages, is capable by varied vocal inflections of expressing all\nstates of mind from helpless dimness to exhaustive argumentative\nperception, from the completest self-devoting fellowship to the most\nneutral aloofness. Rosamond’s thin utterance threw into the words “What\ncan—I—do!” as much neutrality as they could hold. They fell like a\nmortal chill on Lydgate’s roused tenderness. He did not storm in\nindignation—he felt too sad a sinking of the heart. And when he spoke\nagain it was more in the tone of a man who forces himself to fulfil a\ntask.“It is necessary for you to know, because I have to give security for a\ntime, and a man must come to make an inventory of the furniture.”"

  "content": "Rosamond colored deeply. “Have you not asked papa for money?” she said,\nas soon as she could speak.“No.”“Then I must ask him!” she said, releasing her hands from Lydgate’s,\nand rising to stand at two yards’ distance from him.“No, Rosy,” said Lydgate, decisively. “It is too late to do that. The\ninventory will be begun to-morrow. Remember it is a mere security: it\nwill make no difference: it is a temporary affair. I insist upon it\nthat your father shall not know, unless I choose to tell him,” added\nLydgate, with a more peremptory emphasis.This certainly was unkind, but Rosamond had thrown him back on evil\nexpectation as to what she would do in the way of quiet steady\ndisobedience. The unkindness seemed unpardonable to her: she was not\ngiven to weeping and disliked it, but now her chin and lips began to\ntremble and the tears welled up. Perhaps it was not possible for\nLydgate, under the double stress of outward material difficulty and of\nhis own proud resistance to humiliating consequences, to imagine fully\nwhat this sudden trial was to a young creature who had known nothing\nbut indulgence, and whose dreams had all been of new indulgence, more\nexactly to her taste. But he did wish to spare her as much as he could,\nand her tears cut him to the heart. He could not speak again\nimmediately; but Rosamond did not go on sobbing: she tried to conquer\nher agitation and wiped away her tears, continuing to look before her\nat the mantel-piece."

  "content": "“Try not to grieve, darling,” said Lydgate, turning his eyes up towards\nher. That she had chosen to move away from him in this moment of her\ntrouble made everything harder to say, but he must absolutely go on.\n“We must brace ourselves to do what is necessary. It is I who have been\nin fault: I ought to have seen that I could not afford to live in this\nway. But many things have told against me in my practice, and it really\njust now has ebbed to a low point. I may recover it, but in the mean\ntime we must pull up—we must change our way of living. We shall weather\nit. When I have given this security I shall have time to look about me;\nand you are so clever that if you turn your mind to managing you will\nschool me into carefulness. I have been a thoughtless rascal about\nsquaring prices—but come, dear, sit down and forgive me.”Lydgate was bowing his neck under the yoke like a creature who had\ntalons, but who had Reason too, which often reduces us to meekness.\nWhen he had spoken the last words in an imploring tone, Rosamond\nreturned to the chair by his side. His self-blame gave her some hope\nthat he would attend to her opinion, and she said—“Why can you not put off having the inventory made? You can send the\nmen away to-morrow when they come.”“I shall not send them away,” said Lydgate, the peremptoriness rising\nagain. Was it of any use to explain?“If we left Middlemarch? there would of course be a sale, and that\nwould do as well.”“But we are not going to leave Middlemarch.”“I am sure, Tertius, it would be much better to do so. Why can we not\ngo to London? Or near Durham, where your family is known?”“We can go nowhere without money, Rosamond.”“Your friends would not wish you to be without money. And surely these\nodious tradesmen might be made to understand that, and to wait, if you\nwould make proper representations to them.”“This is idle Rosamond,” said Lydgate, angrily. “You must learn to take\nmy judgment on questions you don’t understand. I have made necessary\narrangements, and they must be carried out. As to friends, I have no\nexpectations whatever from them, and shall not ask them for anything.”Rosamond sat perfectly still. The thought in her mind was that if she\nhad known how Lydgate would behave, she would never have married him.“We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words, dear,” said\nLydgate, trying to be gentle again. “There are some details that I want\nto consider with you. Dover says he will take a good deal of the plate\nback again, and any of the jewellery we like. He really behaves very\nwell.”“Are we to go without spoons and forks then?” said Rosamond, whose very\nlips seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her utterance. She was\ndetermined to make no further resistance or suggestions."

  "content": "“Oh no, dear!” said Lydgate. “But look here,” he continued, drawing a\npaper from his pocket and opening it; “here is Dover’s account. See, I\nhave marked a number of articles, which if we returned them would\nreduce the amount by thirty pounds and more. I have not marked any of\nthe jewellery.” Lydgate had really felt this point of the jewellery\nvery bitter to himself; but he had overcome the feeling by severe\nargument. He could not propose to Rosamond that she should return any\nparticular present of his, but he had told himself that he was bound to\nput Dover’s offer before her, and her inward prompting might make the\naffair easy.“It is useless for me to look, Tertius,” said Rosamond, calmly; “you\nwill return what you please.” She would not turn her eyes on the paper,\nand Lydgate, flushing up to the roots of his hair, drew it back and let\nit fall on his knee. Meanwhile Rosamond quietly went out of the room,\nleaving Lydgate helpless and wondering. Was she not coming back? It\nseemed that she had no more identified herself with him than if they\nhad been creatures of different species and opposing interests. He\ntossed his head and thrust his hands deep into his pockets with a sort\nof vengeance. There was still science—there were still good objects to\nwork for. He must give a tug still—all the stronger because other\nsatisfactions were going.But the door opened and Rosamond re-entered. She carried the leather\nbox containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket which\ncontained other boxes, and laying them on the chair where she had been\nsitting, she said, with perfect propriety in her air—“This is all the jewellery you ever gave me. You can return what you\nlike of it, and of the plate also. You will not, of course, expect me\nto stay at home to-morrow. I shall go to papa’s.”To many women the look Lydgate cast at her would have been more\nterrible than one of anger: it had in it a despairing acceptance of the\ndistance she was placing between them.“And when shall you come back again?” he said, with a bitter edge on\nhis accent.“Oh, in the evening. Of course I shall not mention the subject to\nmamma.” Rosamond was convinced that no woman could behave more\nirreproachably than she was behaving; and she went to sit down at her\nwork-table. Lydgate sat meditating a minute or two, and the result was\nthat he said, with some of the old emotion in his tone—“Now we have been united, Rosy, you should not leave me to myself in\nthe first trouble that has come.”“Certainly not,” said Rosamond; “I shall do everything it becomes me to\ndo.”"

I understand your shrinking from the\nhumiliation of these money affairs. But, my dear Rosamond, as a\nquestion of pride, which I feel just as much as you can, it is surely\nbetter to manage the thing ourselves, and let the servants see as\nlittle of it as possible; and since you are my wife, there is no\nhindering your share in my disgraces—if there were disgraces.”Rosamond did not answer immediately, but at last she said, “Very well,\nI will stay at home.”“I shall not touch these jewels, Rosy. Take them away again. But I will\nwrite out a list of plate that we may return, and that can be packed up\nand sent at once.”“The servants will know _that_,” said Rosamond, with the slightest\ntouch of sarcasm.“Well, we must meet some disagreeables as necessities. Where is the\nink, I wonder?” said Lydgate, rising, and throwing the account on the\nlarger table where he meant to write.Rosamond went to reach the inkstand, and after setting it on the table\nwas going to turn away, when Lydgate, who was standing close by, put\nhis arm round her and drew her towards him, saying—“Come, darling, let us make the best of things. It will only be for a\ntime, I hope, that we shall have to be stingy and particular. Kiss me.”His native warm-heartedness took a great deal of quenching, and it is a\npart of manliness for a husband to feel keenly the fact that an\ninexperienced girl has got into trouble by marrying him. She received\nhis kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an appearance of\naccord was recovered for the time. But Lydgate could not help looking\nforward with dread to the inevitable future discussions about\nexpenditure and the necessity for a complete change in their way of\nliving.CHAPTER LIX.“They said of old the Soul had human shape,\nBut smaller, subtler than the fleshly self,\nSo wandered forth for airing when it pleased.\nAnd see! beside her cherub-face there floats\nA pale-lipped form aerial whispering\nIts promptings in that little shell her ear.”"

  "content": "News is often dispersed as thoughtlessly and effectively as that pollen\nwhich the bees carry off (having no idea how powdery they are) when\nthey are buzzing in search of their particular nectar. This fine\ncomparison has reference to Fred Vincy, who on that evening at Lowick\nParsonage heard a lively discussion among the ladies on the news which\ntheir old servant had got from Tantripp concerning Mr. Casaubon’s\nstrange mention of Mr. Ladislaw in a codicil to his will made not long\nbefore his death. Miss Winifred was astounded to find that her brother\nhad known the fact before, and observed that Camden was the most\nwonderful man for knowing things and not telling them; whereupon Mary\nGarth said that the codicil had perhaps got mixed up with the habits of\nspiders, which Miss Winifred never would listen to. Mrs. Farebrother\nconsidered that the news had something to do with their having only\nonce seen Mr. Ladislaw at Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small\ncompassionate mewings.Fred knew little and cared less about Ladislaw and the Casaubons, and\nhis mind never recurred to that discussion till one day calling on\nRosamond at his mother’s request to deliver a message as he passed, he\nhappened to see Ladislaw going away. Fred and Rosamond had little to\nsay to each other now that marriage had removed her from collision with\nthe unpleasantness of brothers, and especially now that he had taken\nwhat she held the stupid and even reprehensible step of giving up the\nChurch to take to such a business as Mr. Garth’s. Hence Fred talked by\npreference of what he considered indifferent news, and “a propos of\nthat young Ladislaw” mentioned what he had heard at Lowick Parsonage.Now Lydgate, like Mr. Farebrother, knew a great deal more than he told,\nand when he had once been set thinking about the relation between Will\nand Dorothea his conjectures had gone beyond the fact. He imagined that\nthere was a passionate attachment on both sides, and this struck him as\nmuch too serious to gossip about. He remembered Will’s irritability\nwhen he had mentioned Mrs. Casaubon, and was the more circumspect. On\nthe whole his surmises, in addition to what he knew of the fact,\nincreased his friendliness and tolerance towards Ladislaw, and made him\nunderstand the vacillation which kept him at Middlemarch after he had\nsaid that he should go away. It was significant of the separateness\nbetween Lydgate’s mind and Rosamond’s that he had no impulse to speak\nto her on the subject; indeed, he did not quite trust her reticence\ntowards Will. And he was right there; though he had no vision of the\nway in which her mind would act in urging her to speak.When she repeated Fred’s news to Lydgate, he said, “Take care you don’t\ndrop the faintest hint to Ladislaw, Rosy. He is likely to fly out as if\nyou insulted him. Of course it is a painful affair.”"

Nobody knows that better than you,” said Will,\nwith light gallantry, but inwardly prepared to be angry.“It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous, and\nforeseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would so much\nlike to marry, and no one who would so much like to marry her as a\ncertain gentleman; and then laying a plan to spoil all by making her\nforfeit her property if she did marry that gentleman—and then—and\nthen—and then—oh, I have no doubt the end will be thoroughly romantic.”“Great God! what do you mean?” said Will, flushing over face and ears,\nhis features seeming to change as if he had had a violent shake. “Don’t\njoke; tell me what you mean.”“You don’t really know?” said Rosamond, no longer playful, and desiring\nnothing better than to tell in order that she might evoke effects.“No!” he returned, impatiently.“Don’t know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in his will that if Mrs.\nCasaubon marries you she is to forfeit all her property?”“How do you know that it is true?” said Will, eagerly.“My brother Fred heard it from the Farebrothers.” Will started up from\nhis chair and reached his hat.“I dare say she likes you better than the property,” said Rosamond,\nlooking at him from a distance.“Pray don’t say any more about it,” said Will, in a hoarse undertone\nextremely unlike his usual light voice. “It is a foul insult to her and\nto me.” Then he sat down absently, looking before him, but seeing\nnothing.“Now you are angry with _me_,” said Rosamond. “It is too bad to bear\n_me_ malice. You ought to be obliged to me for telling you.”“So I am,” said Will, abruptly, speaking with that kind of double soul\nwhich belongs to dreamers who answer questions.“I expect to hear of the marriage,” said Rosamond, playfully."

  "content": "“Never! You will never hear of the marriage!”With those words uttered impetuously, Will rose, put out his hand to\nRosamond, still with the air of a somnambulist, and went away.When he was gone, Rosamond left her chair and walked to the other end\nof the room, leaning when she got there against a chiffonniere, and\nlooking out of the window wearily. She was oppressed by ennui, and by\nthat dissatisfaction which in women’s minds is continually turning into\na trivial jealousy, referring to no real claims, springing from no\ndeeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism, and yet capable\nof impelling action as well as speech. “There really is nothing to care\nfor much,” said poor Rosamond inwardly, thinking of the family at\nQuallingham, who did not write to her; and that perhaps Tertius when he\ncame home would tease her about expenses. She had already secretly\ndisobeyed him by asking her father to help them, and he had ended\ndecisively by saying, “I am more likely to want help myself.”CHAPTER LX.Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.\n—_Justice Shallow_."

  "content": "A few days afterwards—it was already the end of August—there was an\noccasion which caused some excitement in Middlemarch: the public, if it\nchose, was to have the advantage of buying, under the distinguished\nauspices of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, the furniture, books, and pictures\nwhich anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind,\nbelonging to Edwin Larcher, Esq. This was not one of the sales\nindicating the depression of trade; on the contrary, it was due to Mr.\nLarcher’s great success in the carrying business, which warranted his\npurchase of a mansion near Riverston already furnished in high style by\nan illustrious Spa physician—furnished indeed with such large framefuls\nof expensive flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs. Larcher was\nnervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be Scriptural. Hence\nthe fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the\nhandbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the history\nof art enabled him to state that the hall furniture, to be sold without\nreserve, comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of Gibbons.At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of\nfestival. There was a table spread with the best cold eatables, as at a\nsuperior funeral; and facilities were offered for that\ngenerous-drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and\ncheerful bidding for undesirable articles. Mr. Larcher’s sale was the\nmore attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the\nend of the town, with a garden and stables attached, in that pleasant\nissue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road\nto the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode’s retired residence, known as\nthe Shrubs. In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all\nclasses with leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in\norder simply to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the\nraces. The second day, when the best furniture was to be sold,\n“everybody” was there; even Mr. Thesiger, the rector of St. Peter’s,\nhad looked in for a short time, wishing to buy the carved table, and\nhad rubbed elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock. There was a\nwreath of Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large\ntable in the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with\ndesk and hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were\noften varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the\nlarge bow-window opening on to the lawn."

  "content": "“Everybody” that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health could\nnot well endure crowds and draughts. But Mrs. Bulstrode had\nparticularly wished to have a certain picture—a “Supper at Emmaus,”\nattributed in the catalogue to Guido; and at the last moment before the\nday of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at the office of the\n“Pioneer,” of which he was now one of the proprietors, to beg of Mr.\nLadislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable\nknowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and judge of the\nvalue of this particular painting—“if,” added the scrupulously polite\nbanker, “attendance at the sale would not interfere with the\narrangements for your departure, which I know is imminent.”This proviso might have sounded rather satirically in Will’s ear if he\nhad been in a mood to care about such satire. It referred to an\nunderstanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of\nthe paper, that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over\nthe management to the subeditor whom he had been training; since he\nwished finally to quit Middlemarch. But indefinite visions of ambition\nare weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly\nagreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve\nwhen we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary. In such\nstates of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning\ntowards miracle: impossible to conceive how our wish could be\nfulfilled, still—very wonderful things have happened! Will did not\nconfess this weakness to himself, but he lingered. What was the use of\ngoing to London at that time of the year? The Rugby men who would\nremember him were not there; and so far as political writing was\nconcerned, he would rather for a few weeks go on with the “Pioneer.” At\nthe present moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to him, he\nhad both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not\nto go till he had once more seen Dorothea. Hence he replied that he had\nreasons for deferring his departure a little, and would be happy to go\nto the sale."

  "content": "Will was in a defiant mood, his consciousness being deeply stung with\nthe thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact\ntantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs\nwhich were to be frustrated by a disposal of property. Like most people\nwho assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction, he\nwas prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might\nhint that he had personal reasons for that assertion—that there was\nanything in his blood, his bearing, or his character to which he gave\nthe mask of an opinion. When he was under an irritating impression of\nthis kind he would go about for days with a defiant look, the color\nchanging in his transparent skin as if he were on the _qui vive_,\nwatching for something which he had to dart upon.This expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale, and those\nwho had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright\nenjoyment would have been struck with a contrast. He was not sorry to\nhave this occasion for appearing in public before the Middlemarch\ntribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the rest, who looked down on him as an\nadventurer, and were in a state of brutal ignorance about Dante—who\nsneered at his Polish blood, and were themselves of a breed very much\nin need of crossing. He stood in a conspicuous place not far from the\nauctioneer, with a fore-finger in each side-pocket and his head thrown\nbackward, not caring to speak to anybody, though he had been cordially\nwelcomed as a connoiss_ure_ by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the\nutmost activity of his great faculties.And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their\npowers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer\nkeenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic\nknowledge. Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might object to be\nconstantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot-jacks to\n“Berghems;” but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins;\nhe was an admirer by nature, and would have liked to have the universe\nunder his hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his\nrecommendation.Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher’s drawing-room furniture was enough for him.\nWhen Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have been\nforgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer’s\nenthusiasm, which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising\nthose things most which were most in need of praise. The fender was of\npolished steel, with much lancet-shaped open-work and a sharp edge."

  "content": "“Now, ladies,” said he, “I shall appeal to you. Here is a fender which\nat any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve, being, as I\nmay say, for quality of steel and quaintness of design, a kind of\nthing”—here Mr. Trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal,\ntrimming his outlines with his left finger—“that might not fall in with\nordinary tastes. Allow me to tell you that by-and-by this style of\nworkmanship will be the only one in vogue—half-a-crown, you said? thank\nyou—going at half-a-crown, this characteristic fender; and I have\nparticular information that the antique style is very much sought after\nin high quarters. Three shillings—three-and-sixpence—hold it well up,\nJoseph! Look, ladies, at the chastity of the design—I have no doubt\nmyself that it was turned out in the last century! Four shillings, Mr.\nMawmsey?—four shillings.”“It’s not a thing I would put in _my_ drawing-room,” said Mrs. Mawmsey,\naudibly, for the warning of the rash husband. “I wonder _at_ Mrs.\nLarcher. Every blessed child’s head that fell against it would be cut\nin two. The edge is like a knife.”“Quite true,” rejoined Mr. Trumbull, quickly, “and most uncommonly\nuseful to have a fender at hand that will cut, if you have a leather\nshoe-tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand:\nmany a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him\ndown. Gentlemen, here’s a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang\nyourselves would cut you down in no time—with astonishing\ncelerity—four-and-sixpence—five—five-and-sixpence—an appropriate thing\nfor a spare bedroom where there was a four-poster and a guest a little\nout of his mind—six shillings—thank you, Mr. Clintup—going at six\nshillings—going—gone!” The auctioneer’s glance, which had been\nsearching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of\nbidding, here dropped on the paper before him, and his voice too\ndropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said, “Mr. Clintup.\nBe handy, Joseph.”“It was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that\njoke on,” said Mr. Clintup, laughing low and apologetically to his next\nneighbor. He was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman, and\nfeared that the audience might regard his bid as a foolish one."

  "content": "Meanwhile Joseph had brought a trayful of small articles. “Now,\nladies,” said Mr. Trumbull, taking up one of the articles, “this tray\ncontains a very recherchy lot—a collection of trifles for the\ndrawing-room table—and trifles make the sum _of_ human things—nothing\nmore important than trifles—(yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes, by-and-by)—but\npass the tray round, Joseph—these bijoux must be examined, ladies. This\nI have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance—a sort of practical\nrebus, I may call it: here, you see, it looks like an elegant\nheart-shaped box, portable—for the pocket; there, again, it becomes\nlike a splendid double flower—an ornament for the table; and now”—Mr.\nTrumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of\nheart-shaped leaves—“a book of riddles! No less than five hundred\nprinted in a beautiful red. Gentlemen, if I had less of a conscience, I\nshould not wish you to bid high for this lot—I have a longing for it\nmyself. What can promote innocent mirth, and I may say virtue, more\nthan a good riddle?—it hinders profane language, and attaches a man to\nthe society of refined females. This ingenious article itself, without\nthe elegant domino-box, card-basket, &c., ought alone to give a high\nprice to the lot. Carried in the pocket it might make an individual\nwelcome in any society. Four shillings, sir?—four shillings for this\nremarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras. Here is a\nsample: ‘How must you spell honey to make it catch lady-birds?\nAnswer—money.’ You hear?—lady-birds—honey money. This is an amusement\nto sharpen the intellect; it has a sting—it has what we call satire,\nand wit without indecency. Four-and-sixpence—five shillings.”The bidding ran on with warming rivalry. Mr. Bowyer was a bidder, and\nthis was too exasperating. Bowyer couldn’t afford it, and only wanted\nto hinder every other man from making a figure. The current carried\neven Mr. Horrock with it, but this committal of himself to an opinion\nfell from him with so little sacrifice of his neutral expression, that\nthe bid might not have been detected as his but for the friendly oaths\nof Mr. Bambridge, who wanted to know what Horrock would do with blasted\nstuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition\nwhich the horse-dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of\nearthly existences. The lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to Mr.\nSpilkins, a young Slender of the neighborhood, who was reckless with\nhis pocket-money and felt his want of memory for riddles.“Come, Trumbull, this is too bad—you’ve been putting some old maid’s\nrubbish into the sale,” murmured Mr. Toller, getting close to the\nauctioneer. “I want to see how the prints go, and I must be off soon.”“_Im_mediately, Mr. Toller. It was only an act of benevolence which\nyour noble heart would approve. Joseph! quick with the prints—Lot 235.\nNow, gentlemen, you who are connoiss_ures_, you are going to have a\ntreat. Here is an engraving of the Duke of Wellington surrounded by his\nstaff on the Field of Waterloo; and notwithstanding recent events which\nhave, as it were, enveloped our great Hero in a cloud, I will be bold\nto say—for a man in my line must not be blown about by political\nwinds—that a finer subject—of the modern order, belonging to our own\ntime and epoch—the understanding of man could hardly conceive: angels\nmight, perhaps, but not men, sirs, not men.”“Who painted it?” said Mr. Powderell, much impressed.“It is a proof before the letter, Mr. Powderell—the painter is not\nknown,” answered Trumbull, with a certain gaspingness in his last\nwords, after which he pursed up his lips and stared round him."

  "content": "“I’ll bid a pound!” said Mr. Powderell, in a tone of resolved emotion,\nas of a man ready to put himself in the breach. Whether from awe or\npity, nobody raised the price on him.Next came two Dutch prints which Mr. Toller had been eager for, and\nafter he had secured them he went away. Other prints, and afterwards\nsome paintings, were sold to leading Middlemarchers who had come with a\nspecial desire for them, and there was a more active movement of the\naudience in and out; some, who had bought what they wanted, going away,\nothers coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the\nrefreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn. It was\nthis marquee that Mr. Bambridge was bent on buying, and he appeared to\nlike looking inside it frequently, as a foretaste of its possession. On\nthe last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with\nhim a new companion, a stranger to Mr. Trumbull and every one else,\nwhose appearance, however, led to the supposition that he might be a\nrelative of the horse-dealer’s—also “given to indulgence.” His large\nwhiskers, imposing swagger, and swing of the leg, made him a striking\nfigure; but his suit of black, rather shabby at the edges, caused the\nprejudicial inference that he was not able to afford himself as much\nindulgence as he liked.“Who is it you’ve picked up, Bam?” said Mr. Horrock, aside.“Ask him yourself,” returned Mr. Bambridge. “He said he’d just turned\nin from the road.”Mr. Horrock eyed the stranger, who was leaning back against his stick\nwith one hand, using his toothpick with the other, and looking about\nhim with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on\nhim by circumstances.At length the “Supper at Emmaus” was brought forward, to Will’s immense\nrelief, for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had\ndrawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just\nbehind the auctioneer. He now came forward again, and his eye caught\nthe conspicuous stranger, who, rather to his surprise, was staring at\nhim markedly. But Will was immediately appealed to by Mr. Trumbull."

  "content": "“Yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes; this interests you as a connoiss_ure_, I\nthink. It is some pleasure,” the auctioneer went on with a rising\nfervor, “to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and\ngentlemen—a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on\na level with his judgment. It is a painting of the Italian school—by\nthe celebrated _Guydo_, the greatest painter in the world, the chief of\nthe Old Masters, as they are called—I take it, because they were up to\na thing or two beyond most of us—in possession of secrets now lost to\nthe bulk of mankind. Let me tell you, gentlemen, I have seen a great\nmany pictures by the Old Masters, and they are not all up to this\nmark—some of them are darker than you might like and not family\nsubjects. But here is a _Guydo_—the frame alone is worth pounds—which\nany lady might be proud to hang up—a suitable thing for what we call a\nrefectory in a charitable institution, if any gentleman of the\nCorporation wished to show his munifi_cence_. Turn it a little, sir?\nyes. Joseph, turn it a little towards Mr. Ladislaw—Mr. Ladislaw, having\nbeen abroad, understands the merit of these things, you observe.”All eyes were for a moment turned towards Will, who said, coolly, “Five\npounds.” The auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance.“Ah! Mr. Ladislaw! the frame alone is worth that. Ladies and gentlemen,\nfor the credit of the town! Suppose it should be discovered hereafter\nthat a gem of art has been amongst us in this town, and nobody in\nMiddlemarch awake to it. Five guineas—five seven-six—five ten. Still,\nladies, still! It is a gem, and ‘Full many a gem,’ as the poet says,\nhas been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no\nbetter, because it was offered in circles where there was—I was going\nto say a low feeling, but no!—Six pounds—six guineas—a _Guydo_ of the\nfirst order going at six guineas—it is an insult to religion, ladies;\nit touches us all as Christians, gentlemen, that a subject like this\nshould go at such a low figure—six pounds ten—seven—”"
