It was at Boulogne I saw your father—a most\nuncommon likeness you are of him, by Jove! mouth—nose—eyes—hair turned\noff your brow just like his—a little in the foreign style. John Bull\ndoesn’t do much of that. But your father was very ill when I saw him.\nLord, lord! hands you might see through. You were a small youngster\nthen. Did he get well?”“No,” said Will, curtly.“Ah! Well! I’ve often wondered what became of your mother. She ran away\nfrom her friends when she was a young lass—a proud-spirited lass, and\npretty, by Jove! I knew the reason why she ran away,” said Raffles,\nwinking slowly as he looked sideways at Will.“You know nothing dishonorable of her, sir,” said Will, turning on him\nrather savagely. But Mr. Raffles just now was not sensitive to shades\nof manner.“Not a bit!” said he, tossing his head decisively. “She was a little\ntoo honorable to like her friends—that was it!” Here Raffles again\nwinked slowly. “Lord bless you, I knew all about ’em—a little in what\nyou may call the respectable thieving line—the high style of\nreceiving-house—none of your holes and corners—first-rate. Slap-up\nshop, high profits and no mistake. But Lord! Sarah would have known\nnothing about it—a dashing young lady she was—fine boarding-school—fit\nfor a lord’s wife—only Archie Duncan threw it at her out of spite,\nbecause she would have nothing to do with him. And so she ran away from\nthe whole concern. I travelled for ’em, sir, in a gentlemanly way—at a\nhigh salary. They didn’t mind her running away at first—godly folks,\nsir, very godly—and she was for the stage. The son was alive then, and\nthe daughter was at a discount. Hallo! here we are at the Blue Bull.\nWhat do you say, Mr. Ladislaw?—shall we turn in and have a glass?”“No, I must say good evening,” said Will, dashing up a passage which\nled into Lowick Gate, and almost running to get out of Raffles’s reach.He walked a long while on the Lowick road away from the town, glad of\nthe starlit darkness when it came. He felt as if he had had dirt cast\non him amidst shouts of scorn. There was this to confirm the fellow’s\nstatement—that his mother never would tell him the reason why she had\nrun away from her family."

But if Dorothea’s friends had known this\nstory—if the Chettams had known it—they would have had a fine color to\ngive their suspicions a welcome ground for thinking him unfit to come\nnear her. However, let them suspect what they pleased, they would find\nthemselves in the wrong. They would find out that the blood in his\nveins was as free from the taint of meanness as theirs.CHAPTER LXI.“Inconsistencies,” answered Imlac, “cannot both be right, but imputed\nto man they may both be true.”—_Rasselas_.The same night, when Mr. Bulstrode returned from a journey to Brassing\non business, his good wife met him in the entrance-hall and drew him\ninto his private sitting-room.“Nicholas,” she said, fixing her honest eyes upon him anxiously, “there\nhas been such a disagreeable man here asking for you—it has made me\nquite uncomfortable.”“What kind of man, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, dreadfully certain of\nthe answer.“A red-faced man with large whiskers, and most impudent in his manner.\nHe declared he was an old friend of yours, and said you would be sorry\nnot to see him. He wanted to wait for you here, but I told him he could\nsee you at the Bank to-morrow morning. Most impudent he was!—stared at\nme, and said his friend Nick had luck in wives. I don’t believe he\nwould have gone away, if Blucher had not happened to break his chain\nand come running round on the gravel—for I was in the garden; so I\nsaid, ‘You’d better go away—the dog is very fierce, and I can’t hold\nhim.’ Do you really know anything of such a man?”“I believe I know who he is, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in his usual\nsubdued voice, “an unfortunate dissolute wretch, whom I helped too much\nin days gone by. However, I presume you will not be troubled by him\nagain. He will probably come to the Bank—to beg, doubtless.”No more was said on the subject until the next day, when Mr. Bulstrode\nhad returned from the town and was dressing for dinner. His wife, not\nsure that he was come home, looked into his dressing-room and saw him\nwith his coat and cravat off, leaning one arm on a chest of drawers and\nstaring absently at the ground. He started nervously and looked up as\nshe entered.“You look very ill, Nicholas. Is there anything the matter?”“I have a good deal of pain in my head,” said Mr. Bulstrode, who was so\nfrequently ailing that his wife was always ready to believe in this\ncause of depression."

Though always polite, it was his\nhabit to receive such services with marital coolness, as his wife’s\nduty. But to-day, while she was bending over him, he said, “You are\nvery good, Harriet,” in a tone which had something new in it to her\near; she did not know exactly what the novelty was, but her woman’s\nsolicitude shaped itself into a darting thought that he might be going\nto have an illness.“Has anything worried you?” she said. “Did that man come to you at the\nBank?”“Yes; it was as I had supposed. He is a man who at one time might have\ndone better. But he has sunk into a drunken debauched creature.”"

Not that she knew much about them. That her husband had at\nfirst been employed in a bank, that he had afterwards entered into what\nhe called city business and gained a fortune before he was\nthree-and-thirty, that he had married a widow who was much older than\nhimself—a Dissenter, and in other ways probably of that disadvantageous\nquality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the\ndispassionate judgment of a second—was almost as much as she had cared\nto learn beyond the glimpses which Mr. Bulstrode’s narrative\noccasionally gave of his early bent towards religion, his inclination\nto be a preacher, and his association with missionary and philanthropic\nefforts. She believed in him as an excellent man whose piety carried a\npeculiar eminence in belonging to a layman, whose influence had turned\nher own mind toward seriousness, and whose share of perishable good had\nbeen the means of raising her own position. But she also liked to think\nthat it was well in every sense for Mr. Bulstrode to have won the hand\nof Harriet Vincy; whose family was undeniable in a Middlemarch light—a\nbetter light surely than any thrown in London thoroughfares or\ndissenting chapel-yards. The unreformed provincial mind distrusted\nLondon; and while true religion was everywhere saving, honest Mrs.\nBulstrode was convinced that to be saved in the Church was more\nrespectable. She so much wished to ignore towards others that her\nhusband had ever been a London Dissenter, that she liked to keep it out\nof sight even in talking to him. He was quite aware of this; indeed in\nsome respects he was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife, whose\nimitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere, who had\nnothing to be ashamed of, and whom he had married out of a thorough\ninclination still subsisting. But his fears were such as belong to a\nman who cares to maintain his recognized supremacy: the loss of high\nconsideration from his wife, as from every one else who did not clearly\nhate him out of enmity to the truth, would be as the beginning of death\nto him.

In\nthe interview at the Bank, Raffles had made it evident that his\neagerness to torment was almost as strong in him as any other greed. He\nhad frankly said that he had turned out of the way to come to\nMiddlemarch, just to look about him and see whether the neighborhood\nwould suit him to live in. He had certainly had a few debts to pay more\nthan he expected, but the two hundred pounds were not gone yet: a cool\nfive-and-twenty would suffice him to go away with for the present. What\nhe had wanted chiefly was to see his friend Nick and family, and know\nall about the prosperity of a man to whom he was so much attached.\nBy-and-by he might come back for a longer stay. This time Raffles\ndeclined to be “seen off the premises,” as he expressed it—declined to\nquit Middlemarch under Bulstrode’s eyes. He meant to go by coach the\nnext day—if he chose.Bulstrode felt himself helpless. Neither threats nor coaxing could\navail: he could not count on any persistent fear nor on any promise. On\nthe contrary, he felt a cold certainty at his heart that Raffles—unless\nprovidence sent death to hinder him—would come back to Middlemarch\nbefore long. And that certainty was a terror."

  "content": "It was not that he was in danger of legal punishment or of beggary: he\nwas in danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment of his neighbors\nand the mournful perception of his wife certain facts of his past life\nwhich would render him an object of scorn and an opprobrium of the\nreligion with which he had diligently associated himself. The terror of\nbeing judged sharpens the memory: it sends an inevitable glare over\nthat long-unvisited past which has been habitually recalled only in\ngeneral phrases. Even without memory, the life is bound into one by a\nzone of dependence in growth and decay; but intense memory forces a man\nto own his blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like a reopened\nwound, a man’s past is not simply a dead history, an outworn\npreparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose\nfrom the life: it is a still quivering part of himself, bringing\nshudders and bitter flavors and the tinglings of a merited shame.Into this second life Bulstrode’s past had now risen, only the\npleasures of it seeming to have lost their quality. Night and day,\nwithout interruption save of brief sleep which only wove retrospect and\nfear into a fantastic present, he felt the scenes of his earlier life\ncoming between him and everything else, as obstinately as when we look\nthrough the window from a lighted room, the objects we turn our backs\non are still before us, instead of the grass and the trees. The\nsuccessive events inward and outward were there in one view: though\neach might be dwelt on in turn, the rest still kept their hold in the\nconsciousness.Once more he saw himself the young banker’s clerk, with an agreeable\nperson, as clever in figures as he was fluent in speech and fond of\ntheological definition: an eminent though young member of a Calvinistic\ndissenting church at Highbury, having had striking experience in\nconviction of sin and sense of pardon. Again he heard himself called\nfor as Brother Bulstrode in prayer meetings, speaking on religious\nplatforms, preaching in private houses. Again he felt himself thinking\nof the ministry as possibly his vocation, and inclined towards\nmissionary labor. That was the happiest time of his life: that was the\nspot he would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest a dream.\nThe people among whom Brother Bulstrode was distinguished were very\nfew, but they were very near to him, and stirred his satisfaction the\nmore; his power stretched through a narrow space, but he felt its\neffect the more intensely. He believed without effort in the peculiar\nwork of grace within him, and in the signs that God intended him for\nspecial instrumentality."

  "content": "Then came the moment of transition; it was with the sense of promotion\nhe had when he, an orphan educated at a commercial charity-school, was\ninvited to a fine villa belonging to Mr. Dunkirk, the richest man in\nthe congregation. Soon he became an intimate there, honored for his\npiety by the wife, marked out for his ability by the husband, whose\nwealth was due to a flourishing city and west-end trade. That was the\nsetting-in of a new current for his ambition, directing his prospects\nof “instrumentality” towards the uniting of distinguished religious\ngifts with successful business.By-and-by came a decided external leading: a confidential subordinate\npartner died, and nobody seemed to the principal so well fitted to fill\nthe severely felt vacancy as his young friend Bulstrode, if he would\nbecome confidential accountant. The offer was accepted. The business\nwas a pawnbroker’s, of the most magnificent sort both in extent and\nprofits; and on a short acquaintance with it Bulstrode became aware\nthat one source of magnificent profit was the easy reception of any\ngoods offered, without strict inquiry as to where they came from. But\nthere was a branch house at the west end, and no pettiness or dinginess\nto give suggestions of shame.He remembered his first moments of shrinking. They were private, and\nwere filled with arguments; some of these taking the form of prayer.\nThe business was established and had old roots; is it not one thing to\nset up a new gin-palace and another to accept an investment in an old\none? The profits made out of lost souls—where can the line be drawn at\nwhich they begin in human transactions? Was it not even God’s way of\nsaving His chosen? “Thou knowest,”—the young Bulstrode had said then,\nas the older Bulstrode was saying now—“Thou knowest how loose my soul\nsits from these things—how I view them all as implements for tilling\nThy garden rescued here and there from the wilderness.”Metaphors and precedents were not wanting; peculiar spiritual\nexperiences were not wanting which at last made the retention of his\nposition seem a service demanded of him: the vista of a fortune had\nalready opened itself, and Bulstrode’s shrinking remained private. Mr.\nDunkirk had never expected that there would be any shrinking at all: he\nhad never conceived that trade had anything to do with the scheme of\nsalvation. And it was true that Bulstrode found himself carrying on two\ndistinct lives; his religious activity could not be incompatible with\nhis business as soon as he had argued himself into not feeling it\nincompatible."

  "content": "Mentally surrounded with that past again, Bulstrode had the same\npleas—indeed, the years had been perpetually spinning them into\nintricate thickness, like masses of spider-web, padding the moral\nsensibility; nay, as age made egoism more eager but less enjoying, his\nsoul had become more saturated with the belief that he did everything\nfor God’s sake, being indifferent to it for his own. And yet—if he\ncould be back in that far-off spot with his youthful poverty—why, then\nhe would choose to be a missionary.But the train of causes in which he had locked himself went on. There\nwas trouble in the fine villa at Highbury. Years before, the only\ndaughter had run away, defied her parents, and gone on the stage; and\nnow the only boy died, and after a short time Mr. Dunkirk died also.\nThe wife, a simple pious woman, left with all the wealth in and out of\nthe magnificent trade, of which she never knew the precise nature, had\ncome to believe in Bulstrode, and innocently adore him as women often\nadore their priest or “man-made” minister. It was natural that after a\ntime marriage should have been thought of between them. But Mrs.\nDunkirk had qualms and yearnings about her daughter, who had long been\nregarded as lost both to God and her parents. It was known that the\ndaughter had married, but she was utterly gone out of sight. The\nmother, having lost her boy, imagined a grandson, and wished in a\ndouble sense to reclaim her daughter. If she were found, there would be\na channel for property—perhaps a wide one—in the provision for several\ngrandchildren. Efforts to find her must be made before Mrs. Dunkirk\nwould marry again. Bulstrode concurred; but after advertisement as well\nas other modes of inquiry had been tried, the mother believed that her\ndaughter was not to be found, and consented to marry without\nreservation of property.The daughter had been found; but only one man besides Bulstrode knew\nit, and he was paid for keeping silence and carrying himself away."

  "content": "That was the bare fact which Bulstrode was now forced to see in the\nrigid outline with which acts present themselves to onlookers. But for\nhimself at that distant time, and even now in burning memory, the fact\nwas broken into little sequences, each justified as it came by\nreasonings which seemed to prove it righteous. Bulstrode’s course up to\nthat time had, he thought, been sanctioned by remarkable providences,\nappearing to point the way for him to be the agent in making the best\nuse of a large property and withdrawing it from perversion. Death and\nother striking dispositions, such as feminine trustfulness, had come;\nand Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell’s words—“Do you call these\nbare events? The Lord pity you!” The events were comparatively small,\nbut the essential condition was there—namely, that they were in favor\nof his own ends. It was easy for him to settle what was due from him to\nothers by inquiring what were God’s intentions with regard to himself.\nCould it be for God’s service that this fortune should in any\nconsiderable proportion go to a young woman and her husband who were\ngiven up to the lightest pursuits, and might scatter it abroad in\ntriviality—people who seemed to lie outside the path of remarkable\nprovidences? Bulstrode had never said to himself beforehand, “The\ndaughter shall not be found”—nevertheless when the moment came he kept\nher existence hidden; and when other moments followed, he soothed the\nmother with consolation in the probability that the unhappy young woman\nmight be no more.There were hours in which Bulstrode felt that his action was\nunrighteous; but how could he go back? He had mental exercises, called\nhimself nought, laid hold on redemption, and went on in his course of\ninstrumentality. And after five years Death again came to widen his\npath, by taking away his wife. He did gradually withdraw his capital,\nbut he did not make the sacrifices requisite to put an end to the\nbusiness, which was carried on for thirteen years afterwards before it\nfinally collapsed. Meanwhile Nicholas Bulstrode had used his hundred\nthousand discreetly, and was become provincially, solidly important—a\nbanker, a Churchman, a public benefactor; also a sleeping partner in\ntrading concerns, in which his ability was directed to economy in the\nraw material, as in the case of the dyes which rotted Mr. Vincy’s silk.\nAnd now, when this respectability had lasted undisturbed for nearly\nthirty years—when all that preceded it had long lain benumbed in the\nconsciousness—that past had risen and immersed his thought as if with\nthe terrible irruption of a new sense overburthening the feeble being.Meanwhile, in his conversation with Raffles, he had learned something\nmomentous, something which entered actively into the struggle of his\nlongings and terrors. There, he thought, lay an opening towards\nspiritual, perhaps towards material rescue."

  "content": "The spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with him. There may be\ncoarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the\nsake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not one of them. He was\nsimply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic\nbeliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of his\ndesires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs. If this be\nhypocrisy, it is a process which shows itself occasionally in us all,\nto whatever confession we belong, and whether we believe in the future\nperfection of our race or in the nearest date fixed for the end of the\nworld; whether we regard the earth as a putrefying nidus for a saved\nremnant, including ourselves, or have a passionate belief in the\nsolidarity of mankind.The service he could do to the cause of religion had been through life\nthe ground he alleged to himself for his choice of action: it had been\nthe motive which he had poured out in his prayers. Who would use money\nand position better than he meant to use them? Who could surpass him in\nself-abhorrence and exaltation of God’s cause? And to Mr. Bulstrode\nGod’s cause was something distinct from his own rectitude of conduct:\nit enforced a discrimination of God’s enemies, who were to be used\nmerely as instruments, and whom it would be as well if possible to keep\nout of money and consequent influence. Also, profitable investments in\ntrades where the power of the prince of this world showed its most\nactive devices, became sanctified by a right application of the profits\nin the hands of God’s servant.This implicit reasoning is essentially no more peculiar to evangelical\nbelief than the use of wide phrases for narrow motives is peculiar to\nEnglishmen. There is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating\nout our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct\nfellow-feeling with individual fellow-men.But a man who believes in something else than his own greed, has\nnecessarily a conscience or standard to which he more or less adapts\nhimself. Bulstrode’s standard had been his serviceableness to God’s\ncause: “I am sinful and nought—a vessel to be consecrated by use—but\nuse me!”—had been the mould into which he had constrained his immense\nneed of being something important and predominating. And now had come a\nmoment in which that mould seemed in danger of being broken and utterly\ncast away.What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a\nstronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of\nthe scoffer, and a darkening of that glory? If this were to be the\nruling of Providence, he was cast out from the temple as one who had\nbrought unclean offerings."

  "content": "He had long poured out utterances of repentance. But today a repentance\nhad come which was of a bitterer flavor, and a threatening Providence\nurged him to a kind of propitiation which was not simply a doctrinal\ntransaction. The divine tribunal had changed its aspect for him;\nself-prostration was no longer enough, and he must bring restitution in\nhis hand. It was really before his God that Bulstrode was about to\nattempt such restitution as seemed possible: a great dread had seized\nhis susceptible frame, and the scorching approach of shame wrought in\nhim a new spiritual need. Night and day, while the resurgent\nthreatening past was making a conscience within him, he was thinking by\nwhat means he could recover peace and trust—by what sacrifice he could\nstay the rod. His belief in these moments of dread was, that if he\nspontaneously did something right, God would save him from the\nconsequences of wrong-doing. For religion can only change when the\nemotions which fill it are changed; and the religion of personal fear\nremains nearly at the level of the savage.He had seen Raffles actually going away on the Brassing coach, and this\nwas a temporary relief; it removed the pressure of an immediate dread,\nbut did not put an end to the spiritual conflict and the need to win\nprotection. At last he came to a difficult resolve, and wrote a letter\nto Will Ladislaw, begging him to be at the Shrubs that evening for a\nprivate interview at nine o’clock. Will had felt no particular surprise\nat the request, and connected it with some new notions about the\n“Pioneer;” but when he was shown into Mr. Bulstrode’s private room, he\nwas struck with the painfully worn look on the banker’s face, and was\ngoing to say, “Are you ill?” when, checking himself in that abruptness,\nhe only inquired after Mrs. Bulstrode, and her satisfaction with the\npicture bought for her.“Thank you, she is quite satisfied; she has gone out with her daughters\nthis evening. I begged you to come, Mr. Ladislaw, because I have a\ncommunication of a very private—indeed, I will say, of a sacredly\nconfidential nature, which I desire to make to you. Nothing, I dare\nsay, has been farther from your thoughts than that there had been\nimportant ties in the past which could connect your history with mine.”Will felt something like an electric shock. He was already in a state\nof keen sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the subject of\nties in the past, and his presentiments were not agreeable. It seemed\nlike the fluctuations of a dream—as if the action begun by that loud\nbloated stranger were being carried on by this pale-eyed sickly looking\npiece of respectability, whose subdued tone and glib formality of\nspeech were at this moment almost as repulsive to him as their\nremembered contrast. He answered, with a marked change of color—“No, indeed, nothing.”"

So far as human laws go, you have no claim on me\nwhatever.”Will was even more uncomfortable than wondering. Mr. Bulstrode had\npaused, leaning his head on his hand, and looking at the floor. But he\nnow fixed his examining glance on Will and said—“I am told that your mother’s name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that she ran\naway from her friends to go on the stage. Also, that your father was at\none time much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you can confirm these\nstatements?”“Yes, they are all true,” said Will, struck with the order in which an\ninquiry had come, that might have been expected to be preliminary to\nthe banker’s previous hints. But Mr. Bulstrode had to-night followed\nthe order of his emotions; he entertained no doubt that the opportunity\nfor restitution had come, and he had an overpowering impulse towards\nthe penitential expression by which he was deprecating chastisement.“Do you know any particulars of your mother’s family?” he continued.“No; she never liked to speak of them. She was a very generous,\nhonorable woman,” said Will, almost angrily.“I do not wish to allege anything against her. Did she never mention\nher mother to you at all?”“I have heard her say that she thought her mother did not know the\nreason of her running away. She said ‘poor mother’ in a pitying tone.”“That mother became my wife,” said Bulstrode, and then paused a moment\nbefore he added, “you have a claim on me, Mr. Ladislaw: as I said\nbefore, not a legal claim, but one which my conscience recognizes. I\nwas enriched by that marriage—a result which would probably not have\ntaken place—certainly not to the same extent—if your grandmother could\nhave discovered her daughter. That daughter, I gather, is no longer\nliving!”“No,” said Will, feeling suspicion and repugnance rising so strongly\nwithin him, that without quite knowing what he did, he took his hat\nfrom the floor and stood up.

I know that you are without fortune, and I wish to\nsupply you adequately from a store which would have probably already\nbeen yours had your grandmother been certain of your mother’s existence\nand been able to find her.”Mr. Bulstrode paused. He felt that he was performing a striking piece\nof scrupulosity in the judgment of his auditor, and a penitential act\nin the eyes of God. He had no clew to the state of Will Ladislaw’s\nmind, smarting as it was from the clear hints of Raffles, and with its\nnatural quickness in construction stimulated by the expectation of\ndiscoveries which he would have been glad to conjure back into\ndarkness. Will made no answer for several moments, till Mr. Bulstrode,\nwho at the end of his speech had cast his eyes on the floor, now raised\nthem with an examining glance, which Will met fully, saying—“I suppose you did know of my mother’s existence, and knew where she\nmight have been found.”Bulstrode shrank—there was a visible quivering in his face and hands.\nHe was totally unprepared to have his advances met in this way, or to\nfind himself urged into more revelation than he had beforehand set down\nas needful. But at that moment he dared not tell a lie, and he felt\nsuddenly uncertain of his ground which he had trodden with some\nconfidence before."

You enter, I trust,\ninto my purpose, Mr. Ladislaw, which has a reference to higher than\nmerely human claims, and as I have already said, is entirely\nindependent of any legal compulsion. I am ready to narrow my own\nresources and the prospects of my family by binding myself to allow you\nfive hundred pounds yearly during my life, and to leave you a\nproportional capital at my death—nay, to do still more, if more should\nbe definitely necessary to any laudable project on your part.” Mr.\nBulstrode had gone on to particulars in the expectation that these\nwould work strongly on Ladislaw, and merge other feelings in grateful\nacceptance.But Will was looking as stubborn as possible, with his lip pouting and\nhis fingers in his side-pockets. He was not in the least touched, and\nsaid firmly,—“Before I make any reply to your proposition, Mr. Bulstrode, I must beg\nyou to answer a question or two. Were you connected with the business\nby which that fortune you speak of was originally made?”Mr. Bulstrode’s thought was, “Raffles has told him.” How could he\nrefuse to answer when he had volunteered what drew forth the question?\nHe answered, “Yes.”“And was that business—or was it not—a thoroughly dishonorable one—nay,\none that, if its nature had been made public, might have ranked those\nconcerned in it with thieves and convicts?”Will’s tone had a cutting bitterness: he was moved to put his question\nas nakedly as he could.Bulstrode reddened with irrepressible anger. He had been prepared for a\nscene of self-abasement, but his intense pride and his habit of\nsupremacy overpowered penitence, and even dread, when this young man,\nwhom he had meant to benefit, turned on him with the air of a judge.“The business was established before I became connected with it, sir;\nnor is it for you to institute an inquiry of that kind,” he answered,\nnot raising his voice, but speaking with quick defiantness."

  "content": "“Yes, it is,” said Will, starting up again with his hat in his hand.\n“It is eminently mine to ask such questions, when I have to decide\nwhether I will have transactions with you and accept your money. My\nunblemished honor is important to me. It is important to me to have no\nstain on my birth and connections. And now I find there is a stain\nwhich I can’t help. My mother felt it, and tried to keep as clear of it\nas she could, and so will I. You shall keep your ill-gotten money. If I\nhad any fortune of my own, I would willingly pay it to any one who\ncould disprove what you have told me. What I have to thank you for is\nthat you kept the money till now, when I can refuse it. It ought to lie\nwith a man’s self that he is a gentleman. Good-night, sir.”Bulstrode was going to speak, but Will, with determined quickness, was\nout of the room in an instant, and in another the hall-door had closed\nbehind him. He was too strongly possessed with passionate rebellion\nagainst this inherited blot which had been thrust on his knowledge to\nreflect at present whether he had not been too hard on Bulstrode—too\narrogantly merciless towards a man of sixty, who was making efforts at\nretrieval when time had rendered them vain.No third person listening could have thoroughly understood the\nimpetuosity of Will’s repulse or the bitterness of his words. No one\nbut himself then knew how everything connected with the sentiment of\nhis own dignity had an immediate bearing for him on his relation to\nDorothea and to Mr. Casaubon’s treatment of him. And in the rush of\nimpulses by which he flung back that offer of Bulstrode’s there was\nmingled the sense that it would have been impossible for him ever to\ntell Dorothea that he had accepted it.As for Bulstrode—when Will was gone he suffered a violent reaction, and\nwept like a woman. It was the first time he had encountered an open\nexpression of scorn from any man higher than Raffles; and with that\nscorn hurrying like venom through his system, there was no sensibility\nleft to consolations. But the relief of weeping had to be checked. His\nwife and daughters soon came home from hearing the address of an\nOriental missionary, and were full of regret that papa had not heard,\nin the first instance, the interesting things which they tried to\nrepeat to him.Perhaps, through all other hidden thoughts, the one that breathed most\ncomfort was, that Will Ladislaw at least was not likely to publish what\nhad taken place that evening.CHAPTER LXII.He was a squyer of lowe degre,\nThat loved the king’s daughter of Hungrie.\n—_Old Romance_."

  "content": "Will Ladislaw’s mind was now wholly bent on seeing Dorothea again, and\nforthwith quitting Middlemarch. The morning after his agitating scene\nwith Bulstrode he wrote a brief letter to her, saying that various\ncauses had detained him in the neighborhood longer than he had\nexpected, and asking her permission to call again at Lowick at some\nhour which she would mention on the earliest possible day, he being\nanxious to depart, but unwilling to do so until she had granted him an\ninterview. He left the letter at the office, ordering the messenger to\ncarry it to Lowick Manor, and wait for an answer.Ladislaw felt the awkwardness of asking for more last words. His former\nfarewell had been made in the hearing of Sir James Chettam, and had\nbeen announced as final even to the butler. It is certainly trying to a\nman’s dignity to reappear when he is not expected to do so: a first\nfarewell has pathos in it, but to come back for a second lends an\nopening to comedy, and it was possible even that there might be bitter\nsneers afloat about Will’s motives for lingering. Still it was on the\nwhole more satisfactory to his feeling to take the directest means of\nseeing Dorothea, than to use any device which might give an air of\nchance to a meeting of which he wished her to understand that it was\nwhat he earnestly sought. When he had parted from her before, he had\nbeen in ignorance of facts which gave a new aspect to the relation\nbetween them, and made a more absolute severance than he had then\nbelieved in. He knew nothing of Dorothea’s private fortune, and being\nlittle used to reflect on such matters, took it for granted that\naccording to Mr. Casaubon’s arrangement marriage to him, Will Ladislaw,\nwould mean that she consented to be penniless. That was not what he\ncould wish for even in his secret heart, or even if she had been ready\nto meet such hard contrast for his sake. And then, too, there was the\nfresh smart of that disclosure about his mother’s family, which if\nknown would be an added reason why Dorothea’s friends should look down\nupon him as utterly below her. The secret hope that after some years he\nmight come back with the sense that he had at least a personal value\nequal to her wealth, seemed now the dreamy continuation of a dream.\nThis change would surely justify him in asking Dorothea to receive him\nonce more."

In\nconsequence of a letter from her uncle announcing his intention to be\nat home in a week, she had driven first to Freshitt to carry the news,\nmeaning to go on to the Grange to deliver some orders with which her\nuncle had intrusted her—thinking, as he said, “a little mental\noccupation of this sort good for a widow.”If Will Ladislaw could have overheard some of the talk at Freshitt that\nmorning, he would have felt all his suppositions confirmed as to the\nreadiness of certain people to sneer at his lingering in the\nneighborhood. Sir James, indeed, though much relieved concerning\nDorothea, had been on the watch to learn Ladislaw’s movements, and had\nan instructed informant in Mr. Standish, who was necessarily in his\nconfidence on this matter. That Ladislaw had stayed in Middlemarch\nnearly two months after he had declared that he was going immediately,\nwas a fact to embitter Sir James’s suspicions, or at least to justify\nhis aversion to a “young fellow” whom he represented to himself as\nslight, volatile, and likely enough to show such recklessness as\nnaturally went along with a position unriveted by family ties or a\nstrict profession. But he had just heard something from Standish which,\nwhile it justified these surmises about Will, offered a means of\nnullifying all danger with regard to Dorothea."

Good Sir James was this morning so far unlike\nhimself that he was irritably anxious to say something to Dorothea on a\nsubject which he usually avoided as if it had been a matter of shame to\nthem both. He could not use Celia as a medium, because he did not\nchoose that she should know the kind of gossip he had in his mind; and\nbefore Dorothea happened to arrive he had been trying to imagine how,\nwith his shyness and unready tongue, he could ever manage to introduce\nhis communication. Her unexpected presence brought him to utter\nhopelessness in his own power of saying anything unpleasant; but\ndesperation suggested a resource; he sent the groom on an unsaddled\nhorse across the park with a pencilled note to Mrs. Cadwallader, who\nalready knew the gossip, and would think it no compromise of herself to\nrepeat it as often as required.Dorothea was detained on the good pretext that Mr. Garth, whom she\nwanted to see, was expected at the hall within the hour, and she was\nstill talking to Caleb on the gravel when Sir James, on the watch for\nthe rector’s wife, saw her coming and met her with the needful hints.“Enough! I understand,”—said Mrs. Cadwallader. “You shall be innocent.\nI am such a blackamoor that I cannot smirch myself.”“I don’t mean that it’s of any consequence,” said Sir James, disliking\nthat Mrs. Cadwallader should understand too much. “Only it is desirable\nthat Dorothea should know there are reasons why she should not receive\nhim again; and I really can’t say so to her. It will come lightly from\nyou.”It came very lightly indeed. When Dorothea quitted Caleb and turned to\nmeet them, it appeared that Mrs. Cadwallader had stepped across the\npark by the merest chance in the world, just to chat with Celia in a\nmatronly way about the baby. And so Mr. Brooke was coming back?\nDelightful!—coming back, it was to be hoped, quite cured of\nParliamentary fever and pioneering. Apropos of the “Pioneer”—somebody\nhad prophesied that it would soon be like a dying dolphin, and turn all\ncolors for want of knowing how to help itself, because Mr. Brooke’s\nprotege, the brilliant young Ladislaw, was gone or going. Had Sir James\nheard that?The three were walking along the gravel slowly, and Sir James, turning\naside to whip a shrub, said he had heard something of that sort.“All false!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “He is not gone, or going,\napparently; the ‘Pioneer’ keeps its color, and Mr. Orlando Ladislaw is\nmaking a sad dark-blue scandal by warbling continually with your Mr.\nLydgate’s wife, who they tell me is as pretty as pretty can be. It\nseems nobody ever goes into the house without finding this young\ngentleman lying on the rug or warbling at the piano. But the people in\nmanufacturing towns are always disreputable.”"

I will not hear any evil\nspoken of Mr. Ladislaw; he has already suffered too much injustice.”Dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought of her\nfeelings; and even if she had been able to reflect, she would have held\nit petty to keep silence at injurious words about Will from fear of\nbeing herself misunderstood. Her face was flushed and her lip trembled.Sir James, glancing at her, repented of his stratagem; but Mrs.\nCadwallader, equal to all occasions, spread the palms of her hands\noutward and said—“Heaven grant it, my dear!—I mean that all bad tales\nabout anybody may be false. But it is a pity that young Lydgate should\nhave married one of these Middlemarch girls. Considering he’s a son of\nsomebody, he might have got a woman with good blood in her veins, and\nnot too young, who would have put up with his profession. There’s Clara\nHarfager, for instance, whose friends don’t know what to do with her;\nand she has a portion. Then we might have had her among us.\nHowever!—it’s no use being wise for other people. Where is Celia? Pray\nlet us go in.”“I am going on immediately to Tipton,” said Dorothea, rather haughtily.\n“Good-by.”Sir James could say nothing as he accompanied her to the carriage. He\nwas altogether discontented with the result of a contrivance which had\ncost him some secret humiliation beforehand.Dorothea drove along between the berried hedgerows and the shorn\ncorn-fields, not seeing or hearing anything around. The tears came and\nrolled down her cheeks, but she did not know it. The world, it seemed,\nwas turning ugly and hateful, and there was no place for her\ntrustfulness. “It is not true—it is not true!” was the voice within her\nthat she listened to; but all the while a remembrance to which there\nhad always clung a vague uneasiness would thrust itself on her\nattention—the remembrance of that day when she had found Will Ladislaw\nwith Mrs. Lydgate, and had heard his voice accompanied by the piano."

I always believed he\nwas good.”—These were her last thoughts before she felt that the\ncarriage was passing under the archway of the lodge-gate at the Grange,\nwhen she hurriedly pressed her handkerchief to her face and began to\nthink of her errands. The coachman begged leave to take out the horses\nfor half an hour as there was something wrong with a shoe; and\nDorothea, having the sense that she was going to rest, took off her\ngloves and bonnet, while she was leaning against a statue in the\nentrance-hall, and talking to the housekeeper. At last she said—“I must stay here a little, Mrs. Kell. I will go into the library and\nwrite you some memoranda from my uncle’s letter, if you will open the\nshutters for me.”“The shutters are open, madam,” said Mrs. Kell, following Dorothea, who\nhad walked along as she spoke. “Mr. Ladislaw is there, looking for\nsomething.”(Will had come to fetch a portfolio of his own sketches which he had\nmissed in the act of packing his movables, and did not choose to leave\nbehind.)Dorothea’s heart seemed to turn over as if it had had a blow, but she\nwas not perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will was there\nwas for the moment all-satisfying to her, like the sight of something\nprecious that one has lost. When she reached the door she said to Mrs.\nKell—“Go in first, and tell him that I am here.”Will had found his portfolio, and had laid it on the table at the far\nend of the room, to turn over the sketches and please himself by\nlooking at the memorable piece of art which had a relation to nature\ntoo mysterious for Dorothea. He was smiling at it still, and shaking\nthe sketches into order with the thought that he might find a letter\nfrom her awaiting him at Middlemarch, when Mrs. Kell close to his elbow\nsaid—“Mrs. Casaubon is coming in, sir.”Will turned round quickly, and the next moment Dorothea was entering.\nAs Mrs. Kell closed the door behind her they met: each was looking at\nthe other, and consciousness was overflowed by something that\nsuppressed utterance. It was not confusion that kept them silent, for\nthey both felt that parting was near, and there is no shamefacedness in\na sad parting.She moved automatically towards her uncle’s chair against the\nwriting-table, and Will, after drawing it out a little for her, went a\nfew paces off and stood opposite to her."

But the mixture of anger in her\nagitation had vanished at the sight of him; she had been used, when\nthey were face to face, always to feel confidence and the happy freedom\nwhich comes with mutual understanding, and how could other people’s\nwords hinder that effect on a sudden? Let the music which can take\npossession of our frame and fill the air with joy for us, sound once\nmore—what does it signify that we heard it found fault with in its\nabsence?“I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to see you,”\nsaid Will, seating himself opposite to her. “I am going away\nimmediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again.”“I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago—you\nthought you were going then,” said Dorothea, her voice trembling a\nlittle.“Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now—things\nwhich have altered my feelings about the future. When I saw you before,\nI was dreaming that I might come back some day. I don’t think I ever\nshall—now.” Will paused here.“You wished me to know the reasons?” said Dorothea, timidly.“Yes,” said Will, impetuously, shaking his head backward, and looking\naway from her with irritation in his face. “Of course I must wish it. I\nhave been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others.\nThere has been a mean implication against my character. I wish you to\nknow that under no circumstances would I have lowered myself by—under\nno circumstances would I have given men the chance of saying that I\nsought money under the pretext of seeking—something else. There was no\nneed of other safeguard against me—the safeguard of wealth was enough.”Will rose from his chair with the last word and went—he hardly knew\nwhere; but it was to the projecting window nearest him, which had been\nopen as now about the same season a year ago, when he and Dorothea had\nstood within it and talked together. Her whole heart was going out at\nthis moment in sympathy with Will’s indignation: she only wanted to\nconvince him that she had never done him injustice, and he seemed to\nhave turned away from her as if she too had been part of the unfriendly\nworld.“It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any\nmeanness to you,” she began. Then in her ardent way, wanting to plead\nwith him, she moved from her chair and went in front of him to her old\nplace in the window, saying, “Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in\nyou?”"
