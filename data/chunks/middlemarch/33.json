  "content": "“No, it is not brave,” said Lydgate, “but if a man is afraid of\ncreeping paralysis?” Then, in another tone, “Yet you have made a great\ndifference in my courage by believing in me. Everything seems more\nbearable since I have talked to you; and if you can clear me in a few\nother minds, especially in Farebrother’s, I shall be deeply grateful.\nThe point I wish you not to mention is the fact of disobedience to my\norders. That would soon get distorted. After all, there is no evidence\nfor me but people’s opinion of me beforehand. You can only repeat my\nown report of myself.”“Mr. Farebrother will believe—others will believe,” said Dorothea. “I\ncan say of you what will make it stupidity to suppose that you would be\nbribed to do a wickedness.”“I don’t know,” said Lydgate, with something like a groan in his voice.\n“I have not taken a bribe yet. But there is a pale shade of bribery\nwhich is sometimes called prosperity. You will do me another great\nkindness, then, and come to see my wife?”“Yes, I will. I remember how pretty she is,” said Dorothea, into whose\nmind every impression about Rosamond had cut deep. “I hope she will\nlike me.”As Lydgate rode away, he thought, “This young creature has a heart\nlarge enough for the Virgin Mary. She evidently thinks nothing of her\nown future, and would pledge away half her income at once, as if she\nwanted nothing for herself but a chair to sit in from which she can\nlook down with those clear eyes at the poor mortals who pray to her.\nShe seems to have what I never saw in any woman before—a fountain of\nfriendship towards men—a man can make a friend of her. Casaubon must\nhave raised some heroic hallucination in her. I wonder if she could\nhave any other sort of passion for a man? Ladislaw?—there was certainly\nan unusual feeling between them. And Casaubon must have had a notion of\nit. Well—her love might help a man more than her money.”"

  "content": "Dorothea on her side had immediately formed a plan of relieving Lydgate\nfrom his obligation to Bulstrode, which she felt sure was a part,\nthough small, of the galling pressure he had to bear. She sat down at\nonce under the inspiration of their interview, and wrote a brief note,\nin which she pleaded that she had more claim than Mr. Bulstrode had to\nthe satisfaction of providing the money which had been serviceable to\nLydgate—that it would be unkind in Lydgate not to grant her the\nposition of being his helper in this small matter, the favor being\nentirely to her who had so little that was plainly marked out for her\nto do with her superfluous money. He might call her a creditor or by\nany other name if it did but imply that he granted her request. She\nenclosed a check for a thousand pounds, and determined to take the\nletter with her the next day when she went to see Rosamond.CHAPTER LXXVII.“And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,\nTo mark the full-fraught man and best indued\nWith some suspicion.”\n—_Henry V_."

  "content": "The next day Lydgate had to go to Brassing, and told Rosamond that he\nshould be away until the evening. Of late she had never gone beyond her\nown house and garden, except to church, and once to see her papa, to\nwhom she said, “If Tertius goes away, you will help us to move, will\nyou not, papa? I suppose we shall have very little money. I am sure I\nhope some one will help us.” And Mr. Vincy had said, “Yes, child, I\ndon’t mind a hundred or two. I can see the end of that.” With these\nexceptions she had sat at home in languid melancholy and suspense,\nfixing her mind on Will Ladislaw’s coming as the one point of hope and\ninterest, and associating this with some new urgency on Lydgate to make\nimmediate arrangements for leaving Middlemarch and going to London,\ntill she felt assured that the coming would be a potent cause of the\ngoing, without at all seeing how. This way of establishing sequences is\ntoo common to be fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond. And\nit is precisely this sort of sequence which causes the greatest shock\nwhen it is sundered: for to see how an effect may be produced is often\nto see possible missings and checks; but to see nothing except the\ndesirable cause, and close upon it the desirable effect, rids us of\ndoubt and makes our minds strongly intuitive. That was the process\ngoing on in poor Rosamond, while she arranged all objects around her\nwith the same nicety as ever, only with more slowness—or sat down to\nthe piano, meaning to play, and then desisting, yet lingering on the\nmusic stool with her white fingers suspended on the wooden front, and\nlooking before her in dreamy ennui. Her melancholy had become so marked\nthat Lydgate felt a strange timidity before it, as a perpetual silent\nreproach, and the strong man, mastered by his keen sensibilities\ntowards this fair fragile creature whose life he seemed somehow to have\nbruised, shrank from her look, and sometimes started at her approach,\nfear of her and fear for her rushing in only the more forcibly after it\nhad been momentarily expelled by exasperation."

She had a letter to post—a letter addressed to Mr. Ladislaw\nand written with charming discretion, but intended to hasten his\narrival by a hint of trouble. The servant-maid, their sole\nhouse-servant now, noticed her coming down-stairs in her walking dress,\nand thought “there never did anybody look so pretty in a bonnet poor\nthing.”"

  "content": "Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was filled with her project of going to\nRosamond, and with the many thoughts, both of the past and the probable\nfuture, which gathered round the idea of that visit. Until yesterday\nwhen Lydgate had opened to her a glimpse of some trouble in his married\nlife, the image of Mrs. Lydgate had always been associated for her with\nthat of Will Ladislaw. Even in her most uneasy moments—even when she\nhad been agitated by Mrs. Cadwallader’s painfully graphic report of\ngossip—her effort, nay, her strongest impulsive prompting, had been\ntowards the vindication of Will from any sullying surmises; and when,\nin her meeting with him afterwards, she had at first interpreted his\nwords as a probable allusion to a feeling towards Mrs. Lydgate which he\nwas determined to cut himself off from indulging, she had had a quick,\nsad, excusing vision of the charm there might be in his constant\nopportunities of companionship with that fair creature, who most likely\nshared his other tastes as she evidently did his delight in music. But\nthere had followed his parting words—the few passionate words in which\nhe had implied that she herself was the object of whom his love held\nhim in dread, that it was his love for her only which he was resolved\nnot to declare but to carry away into banishment. From the time of that\nparting, Dorothea, believing in Will’s love for her, believing with a\nproud delight in his delicate sense of honor and his determination that\nno one should impeach him justly, felt her heart quite at rest as to\nthe regard he might have for Mrs. Lydgate. She was sure that the regard\nwas blameless.There are natures in which, if they love us, we are conscious of having\na sort of baptism and consecration: they bind us over to rectitude and\npurity by their pure belief about us; and our sins become that worst\nkind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible altar of trust. “If\nyou are not good, none is good”—those little words may give a terrific\nmeaning to responsibility, may hold a vitriolic intensity for remorse.Dorothea’s nature was of that kind: her own passionate faults lay along\nthe easily counted open channels of her ardent character; and while she\nwas full of pity for the visible mistakes of others, she had not yet\nany material within her experience for subtle constructions and\nsuspicions of hidden wrong. But that simplicity of hers, holding up an\nideal for others in her believing conception of them, was one of the\ngreat powers of her womanhood. And it had from the first acted strongly\non Will Ladislaw. He felt, when he parted from her, that the brief\nwords by which he had tried to convey to her his feeling about herself\nand the division which her fortune made between them, would only profit\nby their brevity when Dorothea had to interpret them: he felt that in\nher mind he had found his highest estimate."

  "content": "And he was right there. In the months since their parting Dorothea had\nfelt a delicious though sad repose in their relation to each other, as\none which was inwardly whole and without blemish. She had an active\nforce of antagonism within her, when the antagonism turned on the\ndefence either of plans or persons that she believed in; and the wrongs\nwhich she felt that Will had received from her husband, and the\nexternal conditions which to others were grounds for slighting him,\nonly gave the more tenacity to her affection and admiring judgment. And\nnow with the disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact\naffecting Will’s social position, which roused afresh Dorothea’s inward\nresistance to what was said about him in that part of her world which\nlay within park palings.“Young Ladislaw the grandson of a thieving Jew pawnbroker” was a phrase\nwhich had entered emphatically into the dialogues about the Bulstrode\nbusiness, at Lowick, Tipton, and Freshitt, and was a worse kind of\nplacard on poor Will’s back than the “Italian with white mice.” Upright\nSir James Chettam was convinced that his own satisfaction was righteous\nwhen he thought with some complacency that here was an added league to\nthat mountainous distance between Ladislaw and Dorothea, which enabled\nhim to dismiss any anxiety in that direction as too absurd. And perhaps\nthere had been some pleasure in pointing Mr. Brooke’s attention to this\nugly bit of Ladislaw’s genealogy, as a fresh candle for him to see his\nown folly by. Dorothea had observed the animus with which Will’s part\nin the painful story had been recalled more than once; but she had\nuttered no word, being checked now, as she had not been formerly in\nspeaking of Will, by the consciousness of a deeper relation between\nthem which must always remain in consecrated secrecy. But her silence\nshrouded her resistant emotion into a more thorough glow; and this\nmisfortune in Will’s lot which, it seemed, others were wishing to fling\nat his back as an opprobrium, only gave something more of enthusiasm to\nher clinging thought."

  "content": "She entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer union, and\nyet she had taken no posture of renunciation. She had accepted her\nwhole relation to Will very simply as part of her marriage sorrows, and\nwould have thought it very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail\nbecause she was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on\nthe superfluities of her lot. She could bear that the chief pleasures\nof her tenderness should lie in memory, and the idea of marriage came\nto her solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom she\nat present knew nothing, but whose merits, as seen by her friends,\nwould be a source of torment to her:—“somebody who will manage your\nproperty for you, my dear,” was Mr. Brooke’s attractive suggestion of\nsuitable characteristics. “I should like to manage it myself, if I knew\nwhat to do with it,” said Dorothea. No—she adhered to her declaration\nthat she would never be married again, and in the long valley of her\nlife which looked so flat and empty of waymarks, guidance would come as\nshe walked along the road, and saw her fellow-passengers by the way.This habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been strong in\nall her waking hours since she had proposed to pay a visit to Mrs.\nLydgate, making a sort of background against which she saw Rosamond’s\nfigure presented to her without hindrances to her interest and\ncompassion. There was evidently some mental separation, some barrier to\ncomplete confidence which had arisen between this wife and the husband\nwho had yet made her happiness a law to him. That was a trouble which\nno third person must directly touch. But Dorothea thought with deep\npity of the loneliness which must have come upon Rosamond from the\nsuspicions cast on her husband; and there would surely be help in the\nmanifestation of respect for Lydgate and sympathy with her.“I shall talk to her about her husband,” thought Dorothea, as she was\nbeing driven towards the town. The clear spring morning, the scent of\nthe moist earth, the fresh leaves just showing their creased-up wealth\nof greenery from out their half-opened sheaths, seemed part of the\ncheerfulness she was feeling from a long conversation with Mr.\nFarebrother, who had joyfully accepted the justifying explanation of\nLydgate’s conduct. “I shall take Mrs. Lydgate good news, and perhaps\nshe will like to talk to me and make a friend of me.”Dorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate: it was about a new\nfine-toned bell for the school-house, and as she had to get out of her\ncarriage very near to Lydgate’s, she walked thither across the street,\nhaving told the coachman to wait for some packages. The street door was\nopen, and the servant was taking the opportunity of looking out at the\ncarriage which was pausing within sight when it became apparent to her\nthat the lady who “belonged to it” was coming towards her.“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea."

The drawing-room door was unlatched,\nand Martha, pushing it without looking into the room, waited for Mrs.\nCasaubon to enter and then turned away, the door having swung open and\nswung back again without noise.Dorothea had less of outward vision than usual this morning, being\nfilled with images of things as they had been and were going to be. She\nfound herself on the other side of the door without seeing anything\nremarkable, but immediately she heard a voice speaking in low tones\nwhich startled her as with a sense of dreaming in daylight, and\nadvancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a\nbookcase, she saw, in the terrible illumination of a certainty which\nfilled up all outlines, something which made her pause, motionless,\nwithout self-possession enough to speak.Seated with his back towards her on a sofa which stood against the wall\non a line with the door by which she had entered, she saw Will\nLadislaw: close by him and turned towards him with a flushed\ntearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to her face sat Rosamond, her\nbonnet hanging back, while Will leaning towards her clasped both her\nupraised hands in his and spoke with low-toned fervor."

  "content": "Rosamond in her agitated absorption had not noticed the silently\nadvancing figure; but when Dorothea, after the first immeasurable\ninstant of this vision, moved confusedly backward and found herself\nimpeded by some piece of furniture, Rosamond was suddenly aware of her\npresence, and with a spasmodic movement snatched away her hands and\nrose, looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested. Will Ladislaw,\nstarting up, looked round also, and meeting Dorothea’s eyes with a new\nlightning in them, seemed changing to marble. But she immediately\nturned them away from him to Rosamond and said in a firm voice—“Excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate, the servant did not know that you were here.\nI called to deliver an important letter for Mr. Lydgate, which I wished\nto put into your own hands.”She laid down the letter on the small table which had checked her\nretreat, and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant glance and\nbow, she went quickly out of the room, meeting in the passage the\nsurprised Martha, who said she was sorry the mistress was not at home,\nand then showed the strange lady out with an inward reflection that\ngrand people were probably more impatient than others.Dorothea walked across the street with her most elastic step and was\nquickly in her carriage again.“Drive on to Freshitt Hall,” she said to the coachman, and any one\nlooking at her might have thought that though she was paler than usual\nshe was never animated by a more self-possessed energy. And that was\nreally her experience. It was as if she had drunk a great draught of\nscorn that stimulated her beyond the susceptibility to other feelings.\nShe had seen something so far below her belief, that her emotions\nrushed back from it and made an excited throng without an object. She\nneeded something active to turn her excitement out upon. She felt power\nto walk and work for a day, without meat or drink. And she would carry\nout the purpose with which she had started in the morning, of going to\nFreshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished\nthem to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial\nnow presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more\nardent in readiness to be his champion. She had never felt anything\nlike this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of her\nmarried life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing pang;\nand she took it as a sign of new strength."

You are going to do something uncomfortable, I know. Is it\nall about Mr. Lydgate, or has something else happened?” Celia had been\nused to watch her sister with expectation.“Yes, dear, a great many things have happened,” said Dodo, in her full\ntones.“I wonder what,” said Celia, folding her arms cozily and leaning\nforward upon them.“Oh, all the troubles of all people on the face of the earth,” said\nDorothea, lifting her arms to the back of her head.“Dear me, Dodo, are you going to have a scheme for them?” said Celia, a\nlittle uneasy at this Hamlet-like raving.But Sir James came in again, ready to accompany Dorothea to the Grange,\nand she finished her expedition well, not swerving in her resolution\nuntil she descended at her own door.CHAPTER LXXVIII.“Would it were yesterday and I i’ the grave,\nWith her sweet faith above for monument.”Rosamond and Will stood motionless—they did not know how long—he\nlooking towards the spot where Dorothea had stood, and she looking\ntowards him with doubt. It seemed an endless time to Rosamond, in whose\ninmost soul there was hardly so much annoyance as gratification from\nwhat had just happened. Shallow natures dream of an easy sway over the\nemotions of others, trusting implicitly in their own petty magic to\nturn the deepest streams, and confident, by pretty gestures and\nremarks, of making the thing that is not as though it were. She knew\nthat Will had received a severe blow, but she had been little used to\nimagining other people’s states of mind except as a material cut into\nshape by her own wishes; and she believed in her own power to soothe or\nsubdue. Even Tertius, that most perverse of men, was always subdued in\nthe long-run: events had been obstinate, but still Rosamond would have\nsaid now, as she did before her marriage, that she never gave up what\nshe had set her mind on.She put out her arm and laid the tips of her fingers on Will’s\ncoat-sleeve."

  "content": "“Don’t touch me!” he said, with an utterance like the cut of a lash,\ndarting from her, and changing from pink to white and back again, as if\nhis whole frame were tingling with the pain of the sting. He wheeled\nround to the other side of the room and stood opposite to her, with the\ntips of his fingers in his pockets and his head thrown back, looking\nfiercely not at Rosamond but at a point a few inches away from her.She was keenly offended, but the signs she made of this were such as\nonly Lydgate was used to interpret. She became suddenly quiet and\nseated herself, untying her hanging bonnet and laying it down with her\nshawl. Her little hands which she folded before her were very cold.It would have been safer for Will in the first instance to have taken\nup his hat and gone away; but he had felt no impulse to do this; on the\ncontrary, he had a horrible inclination to stay and shatter Rosamond\nwith his anger. It seemed as impossible to bear the fatality she had\ndrawn down on him without venting his fury as it would be to a panther\nto bear the javelin-wound without springing and biting. And yet—how\ncould he tell a woman that he was ready to curse her? He was fuming\nunder a repressive law which he was forced to acknowledge: he was\ndangerously poised, and Rosamond’s voice now brought the decisive\nvibration. In flute-like tones of sarcasm she said—“You can easily go after Mrs. Casaubon and explain your preference.”“Go after her!” he burst out, with a sharp edge in his voice. “Do you\nthink she would turn to look at me, or value any word I ever uttered to\nher again at more than a dirty feather?—Explain! How can a man explain\nat the expense of a woman?”“You can tell her what you please,” said Rosamond with more tremor.“Do you suppose she would like me better for sacrificing you? She is\nnot a woman to be flattered because I made myself despicable—to believe\nthat I must be true to her because I was a dastard to you.”He began to move about with the restlessness of a wild animal that sees\nprey but cannot reach it. Presently he burst out again—"

She’ll think of me as an incarnate insult to her, from the\nfirst moment we—”Will stopped as if he had found himself grasping something that must\nnot be thrown and shattered. He found another vent for his rage by\nsnatching up Rosamond’s words again, as if they were reptiles to be\nthrottled and flung off.“Explain! Tell a man to explain how he dropped into hell! Explain my\npreference! I never had a _preference_ for her, any more than I have a\npreference for breathing. No other woman exists by the side of her. I\nwould rather touch her hand if it were dead, than I would touch any\nother woman’s living.”Rosamond, while these poisoned weapons were being hurled at her, was\nalmost losing the sense of her identity, and seemed to be waking into\nsome new terrible existence. She had no sense of chill resolute\nrepulsion, of reticent self-justification such as she had known under\nLydgate’s most stormy displeasure: all her sensibility was turned into\na bewildering novelty of pain; she felt a new terrified recoil under a\nlash never experienced before. What another nature felt in opposition\nto her own was being burnt and bitten into her consciousness. When Will\nhad ceased to speak she had become an image of sickened misery: her\nlips were pale, and her eyes had a tearless dismay in them. If it had\nbeen Tertius who stood opposite to her, that look of misery would have\nbeen a pang to him, and he would have sunk by her side to comfort her,\nwith that strong-armed comfort which she had often held very cheap.Let it be forgiven to Will that he had no such movement of pity. He had\nfelt no bond beforehand to this woman who had spoiled the ideal\ntreasure of his life, and he held himself blameless. He knew that he\nwas cruel, but he had no relenting in him yet."

  "content": "After he had done speaking, he still moved about, half in absence of\nmind, and Rosamond sat perfectly still. At length Will, seeming to\nbethink himself, took up his hat, yet stood some moments irresolute. He\nhad spoken to her in a way that made a phrase of common politeness\ndifficult to utter; and yet, now that he had come to the point of going\naway from her without further speech, he shrank from it as a brutality;\nhe felt checked and stultified in his anger. He walked towards the\nmantel-piece and leaned his arm on it, and waited in silence for—he\nhardly knew what. The vindictive fire was still burning in him, and he\ncould utter no word of retractation; but it was nevertheless in his\nmind that having come back to this hearth where he had enjoyed a\ncaressing friendship he had found calamity seated there—he had had\nsuddenly revealed to him a trouble that lay outside the home as well as\nwithin it. And what seemed a foreboding was pressing upon him as with\nslow pincers:—that his life might come to be enslaved by this helpless\nwoman who had thrown herself upon him in the dreary sadness of her\nheart. But he was in gloomy rebellion against the fact that his quick\napprehensiveness foreshadowed to him, and when his eyes fell on\nRosamond’s blighted face it seemed to him that he was the more pitiable\nof the two; for pain must enter into its glorified life of memory\nbefore it can turn into compassion.And so they remained for many minutes, opposite each other, far apart,\nin silence; Will’s face still possessed by a mute rage, and Rosamond’s\nby a mute misery. The poor thing had no force to fling out any passion\nin return; the terrible collapse of the illusion towards which all her\nhope had been strained was a stroke which had too thoroughly shaken\nher: her little world was in ruins, and she felt herself tottering in\nthe midst as a lonely bewildered consciousness.Will wished that she would speak and bring some mitigating shadow\nacross his own cruel speech, which seemed to stand staring at them both\nin mockery of any attempt at revived fellowship. But she said nothing,\nand at last with a desperate effort over himself, he asked, “Shall I\ncome in and see Lydgate this evening?”“If you like,” Rosamond answered, just audibly.And then Will went out of the house, Martha never knowing that he had\nbeen in.After he was gone, Rosamond tried to get up from her seat, but fell\nback fainting. When she came to herself again, she felt too ill to make\nthe exertion of rising to ring the bell, and she remained helpless\nuntil the girl, surprised at her long absence, thought for the first\ntime of looking for her in all the down-stairs rooms. Rosamond said\nthat she had felt suddenly sick and faint, and wanted to be helped\nup-stairs. When there she threw herself on the bed with her clothes on,\nand lay in apparent torpor, as she had done once before on a memorable\nday of grief."

When he felt her pulse, her eyes rested on\nhim with more persistence than they had done for a long while, as if\nshe felt some content that he was there. He perceived the difference in\na moment, and seating himself by her put his arm gently under her, and\nbending over her said, “My poor Rosamond! has something agitated you?”\nClinging to him she fell into hysterical sobbings and cries, and for\nthe next hour he did nothing but soothe and tend her. He imagined that\nDorothea had been to see her, and that all this effect on her nervous\nsystem, which evidently involved some new turning towards himself, was\ndue to the excitement of the new impressions which that visit had\nraised.CHAPTER LXXIX.“Now, I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended their talk, they\ndrew nigh to a very miry slough, that was in the midst of the plain;\nand they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into the bog. The name\nof the slough was Despond.”—BUNYAN.When Rosamond was quiet, and Lydgate had left her, hoping that she\nmight soon sleep under the effect of an anodyne, he went into the\ndrawing-room to fetch a book which he had left there, meaning to spend\nthe evening in his work-room, and he saw on the table Dorothea’s letter\naddressed to him. He had not ventured to ask Rosamond if Mrs. Casaubon\nhad called, but the reading of this letter assured him of the fact, for\nDorothea mentioned that it was to be carried by herself.When Will Ladislaw came in a little later Lydgate met him with a\nsurprise which made it clear that he had not been told of the earlier\nvisit, and Will could not say, “Did not Mrs. Lydgate tell you that I\ncame this morning?”“Poor Rosamond is ill,” Lydgate added immediately on his greeting.“Not seriously, I hope,” said Will.“No—only a slight nervous shock—the effect of some agitation. She has\nbeen overwrought lately. The truth is, Ladislaw, I am an unlucky devil.\nWe have gone through several rounds of purgatory since you left, and I\nhave lately got on to a worse ledge of it than ever. I suppose you are\nonly just come down—you look rather battered—you have not been long\nenough in the town to hear anything?”“I travelled all night and got to the White Hart at eight o’clock this\nmorning. I have been shutting myself up and resting,” said Will,\nfeeling himself a sneak, but seeing no alternative to this evasion.And then he heard Lydgate’s account of the troubles which Rosamond had\nalready depicted to him in her way. She had not mentioned the fact of\nWill’s name being connected with the public story—this detail not\nimmediately affecting her—and he now heard it for the first time."

I suppose it is true\nthat Raffles spoke to you.”“Yes,” said Will, sardonically. “I shall be fortunate if gossip does\nnot make me the most disreputable person in the whole affair. I should\nthink the latest version must be, that I plotted with Raffles to murder\nBulstrode, and ran away from Middlemarch for the purpose.”He was thinking “Here is a new ring in the sound of my name to\nrecommend it in her hearing; however—what does it signify now?”But he said nothing of Bulstrode’s offer to him. Will was very open and\ncareless about his personal affairs, but it was among the more\nexquisite touches in nature’s modelling of him that he had a delicate\ngenerosity which warned him into reticence here. He shrank from saying\nthat he had rejected Bulstrode’s money, in the moment when he was\nlearning that it was Lydgate’s misfortune to have accepted it.Lydgate too was reticent in the midst of his confidence. He made no\nallusion to Rosamond’s feeling under their trouble, and of Dorothea he\nonly said, “Mrs. Casaubon has been the one person to come forward and\nsay that she had no belief in any of the suspicions against me.”\nObserving a change in Will’s face, he avoided any further mention of\nher, feeling himself too ignorant of their relation to each other not\nto fear that his words might have some hidden painful bearing on it.\nAnd it occurred to him that Dorothea was the real cause of the present\nvisit to Middlemarch."

When Lydgate spoke with\ndesperate resignation of going to settle in London, and said with a\nfaint smile, “We shall have you again, old fellow,” Will felt\ninexpressibly mournful, and said nothing. Rosamond had that morning\nentreated him to urge this step on Lydgate; and it seemed to him as if\nhe were beholding in a magic panorama a future where he himself was\nsliding into that pleasureless yielding to the small solicitations of\ncircumstance, which is a commoner history of perdition than any single\nmomentous bargain.We are on a perilous margin when we begin to look passively at our\nfuture selves, and see our own figures led with dull consent into\ninsipid misdoing and shabby achievement. Poor Lydgate was inwardly\ngroaning on that margin, and Will was arriving at it. It seemed to him\nthis evening as if the cruelty of his outburst to Rosamond had made an\nobligation for him, and he dreaded the obligation: he dreaded Lydgate’s\nunsuspecting good-will: he dreaded his own distaste for his spoiled\nlife, which would leave him in motiveless levity.CHAPTER LXXX.Stern lawgiver! yet thou dost wear\nThe Godhead’s most benignant grace;\nNor know we anything so fair\nAs is the smile upon thy face;\nFlowers laugh before thee on their beds,\nAnd fragrance in thy footing treads;\nThou dost preserve the Stars from wrong;\nAnd the most ancient Heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong.\n—WORDSWORTH: _Ode to Duty_."

  "content": "When Dorothea had seen Mr. Farebrother in the morning, she had promised\nto go and dine at the parsonage on her return from Freshitt. There was\na frequent interchange of visits between her and the Farebrother\nfamily, which enabled her to say that she was not at all lonely at the\nManor, and to resist for the present the severe prescription of a lady\ncompanion. When she reached home and remembered her engagement, she was\nglad of it; and finding that she had still an hour before she could\ndress for dinner, she walked straight to the schoolhouse and entered\ninto a conversation with the master and mistress about the new bell,\ngiving eager attention to their small details and repetitions, and\ngetting up a dramatic sense that her life was very busy. She paused on\nher way back to talk to old Master Bunney who was putting in some\ngarden-seeds, and discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the\ncrops that would make the most return on a perch of ground, and the\nresult of sixty years’ experience as to soils—namely, that if your soil\nwas pretty mellow it would do, but if there came wet, wet, wet to make\nit all of a mummy, why then—Finding that the social spirit had beguiled her into being rather late,\nshe dressed hastily and went over to the parsonage rather earlier than\nwas necessary. That house was never dull, Mr. Farebrother, like another\nWhite of Selborne, having continually something new to tell of his\ninarticulate guests and _proteges_, whom he was teaching the boys not\nto torment; and he had just set up a pair of beautiful goats to be pets\nof the village in general, and to walk at large as sacred animals. The\nevening went by cheerfully till after tea, Dorothea talking more than\nusual and dilating with Mr. Farebrother on the possible histories of\ncreatures that converse compendiously with their antennae, and for\naught we know may hold reformed parliaments; when suddenly some\ninarticulate little sounds were heard which called everybody’s\nattention.“Henrietta Noble,” said Mrs. Farebrother, seeing her small sister\nmoving about the furniture-legs distressfully, “what is the matter?”“I have lost my tortoise-shell lozenge-box. I fear the kitten has\nrolled it away,” said the tiny old lady, involuntarily continuing her\nbeaver-like notes.“Is it a great treasure, aunt?” said Mr. Farebrother, putting up his\nglasses and looking at the carpet.“Mr. Ladislaw gave it me,” said Miss Noble. “A German box—very pretty,\nbut if it falls it always spins away as far as it can.”“Oh, if it is Ladislaw’s present,” said Mr. Farebrother, in a deep tone\nof comprehension, getting up and hunting. The box was found at last\nunder a chiffonier, and Miss Noble grasped it with delight, saying, “it\nwas under a fender the last time.”“That is an affair of the heart with my aunt,” said Mr. Farebrother,\nsmiling at Dorothea, as he reseated himself.“If Henrietta Noble forms an attachment to any one, Mrs. Casaubon,”\nsaid his mother, emphatically,—“she is like a dog—she would take their\nshoes for a pillow and sleep the better.”“Mr. Ladislaw’s shoes, I would,” said Henrietta Noble."

She was surprised and\nannoyed to find that her heart was palpitating violently, and that it\nwas quite useless to try after a recovery of her former animation.\nAlarmed at herself—fearing some further betrayal of a change so marked\nin its occasion, she rose and said in a low voice with undisguised\nanxiety, “I must go; I have overtired myself.”Mr. Farebrother, quick in perception, rose and said, “It is true; you\nmust have half-exhausted yourself in talking about Lydgate. That sort\nof work tells upon one after the excitement is over.”He gave her his arm back to the Manor, but Dorothea did not attempt to\nspeak, even when he said good-night.The limit of resistance was reached, and she had sunk back helpless\nwithin the clutch of inescapable anguish. Dismissing Tantripp with a\nfew faint words, she locked her door, and turning away from it towards\nthe vacant room she pressed her hands hard on the top of her head, and\nmoaned out—“Oh, I did love him!”Then came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook her too\nthoroughly to leave any power of thought. She could only cry in loud\nwhispers, between her sobs, after her lost belief which she had planted\nand kept alive from a very little seed since the days in Rome—after her\nlost joy of clinging with silent love and faith to one who, misprized\nby others, was worthy in her thought—after her lost woman’s pride of\nreigning in his memory—after her sweet dim perspective of hope, that\nalong some pathway they should meet with unchanged recognition and take\nup the backward years as a yesterday.In that hour she repeated what the merciful eyes of solitude have\nlooked on for ages in the spiritual struggles of man—she besought\nhardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring her relief from the\nmysterious incorporeal might of her anguish: she lay on the bare floor\nand let the night grow cold around her; while her grand woman’s frame\nwas shaken by sobs as if she had been a despairing child.There were two images—two living forms that tore her heart in two, as\nif it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her child divided\nby the sword, and presses one bleeding half to her breast while her\ngaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the\nlying woman that has never known the mother’s pang."

The fire of Dorothea’s anger\nwas not easily spent, and it flamed out in fitful returns of spurning\nreproach. Why had he come obtruding his life into hers, hers that might\nhave been whole enough without him? Why had he brought his cheap regard\nand his lip-born words to her who had nothing paltry to give in\nexchange? He knew that he was deluding her—wished, in the very moment\nof farewell, to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of\nher heart, and knew that he had spent it half before. Why had he not\nstayed among the crowd of whom she asked nothing—but only prayed that\nthey might be less contemptible?But she lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries and\nmoans: she subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor she\nsobbed herself to sleep."

  "content": "In the chill hours of the morning twilight, when all was dim around\nher, she awoke—not with any amazed wondering where she was or what had\nhappened, but with the clearest consciousness that she was looking into\nthe eyes of sorrow. She rose, and wrapped warm things around her, and\nseated herself in a great chair where she had often watched before. She\nwas vigorous enough to have borne that hard night without feeling ill\nin body, beyond some aching and fatigue; but she had waked to a new\ncondition: she felt as if her soul had been liberated from its terrible\nconflict; she was no longer wrestling with her grief, but could sit\ndown with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her\nthoughts. For now the thoughts came thickly. It was not in Dorothea’s\nnature, for longer than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the\nnarrow cell of her calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness\nthat only sees another’s lot as an accident of its own.She began now to live through that yesterday morning deliberately\nagain, forcing herself to dwell on every detail and its possible\nmeaning. Was she alone in that scene? Was it her event only? She forced\nherself to think of it as bound up with another woman’s life—a woman\ntowards whom she had set out with a longing to carry some clearness and\ncomfort into her beclouded youth. In her first outleap of jealous\nindignation and disgust, when quitting the hateful room, she had flung\naway all the mercy with which she had undertaken that visit. She had\nenveloped both Will and Rosamond in her burning scorn, and it seemed to\nher as if Rosamond were burned out of her sight forever. But that base\nprompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless\nlover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the\ndominant spirit of justice within her had once overcome the tumult and\nhad once shown her the truer measure of things. All the active thought\nwith which she had before been representing to herself the trials of\nLydgate’s lot, and this young marriage union which, like her own,\nseemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles—all this vivid\nsympathetic experience returned to her now as a power: it asserted\nitself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let us see as\nwe saw in the day of our ignorance. She said to her own irremediable\ngrief, that it should make her more helpful, instead of driving her\nback from effort.And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact\nwith hers laid an obligation on her as if they had been suppliants\nbearing the sacred branch? The objects of her rescue were not to be\nsought out by her fancy: they were chosen for her. She yearned towards\nthe perfect Right, that it might make a throne within her, and rule her\nerrant will. “What should I do—how should I act now, this very day, if\nI could clutch my own pain, and compel it to silence, and think of\nthose three?”"

  "content": "It had taken long for her to come to that question, and there was light\npiercing into the room. She opened her curtains, and looked out towards\nthe bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the\nentrance-gates. On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back\nand a woman carrying her baby; in the field she could see figures\nmoving—perhaps the shepherd with his dog. Far off in the bending sky\nwas the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of the world and the\nmanifold wakings of men to labor and endurance. She was a part of that\ninvoluntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from\nher luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish\ncomplaining.What she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear, but\nsomething that she could achieve stirred her as with an approaching\nmurmur which would soon gather distinctness. She took off the clothes\nwhich seemed to have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them,\nand began to make her toilet. Presently she rang for Tantripp, who came\nin her dressing-gown.“Why, madam, you’ve never been in bed this blessed night,” burst out\nTantripp, looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea’s face, which\nin spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater\ndolorosa. “You’ll kill yourself, you _will_. Anybody might think now\nyou had a right to give yourself a little comfort.”“Don’t be alarmed, Tantripp,” said Dorothea, smiling. “I have slept; I\nam not ill. I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible. And\nI want you to bring me my new dress; and most likely I shall want my\nnew bonnet to-day.”“They’ve lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and most\nthankful I shall be to see you with a couple o’ pounds’ worth less of\ncrape,” said Tantripp, stooping to light the fire. “There’s a reason in\nmourning, as I’ve always said; and three folds at the bottom of your\nskirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet—and if ever anybody looked\nlike an angel, it’s you in a net quilling—is what’s consistent for a\nsecond year. At least, that’s _my_ thinking,” ended Tantripp, looking\nanxiously at the fire; “and if anybody was to marry me flattering\nhimself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years for him, he’d be\ndeceived by his own vanity, that’s all.”“The fire will do, my good Tan,” said Dorothea, speaking as she used to\ndo in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice; “get me the\ncoffee.”"

Tantripp would never have\nfound the clew to this mystery. Dorothea wished to acknowledge that she\nhad not the less an active life before her because she had buried a\nprivate joy; and the tradition that fresh garments belonged to all\ninitiation, haunting her mind, made her grasp after even that slight\noutward help towards calm resolve. For the resolve was not easy.Nevertheless at eleven o’clock she was walking towards Middlemarch,\nhaving made up her mind that she would make as quietly and unnoticeably\nas possible her second attempt to see and save Rosamond.CHAPTER LXXXI.Du Erde warst auch diese Nacht beständig,\nUnd athmest neu erquickt zu meinen Füssen,\nBeginnest schon mit Lust mich zu umgeben,\nDu regst und rührst ein kräftiges Beschliessen\n_Zum höchsten Dasein immerfort zu streben_.\n—_Faust:_ 2r Theil.When Dorothea was again at Lydgate’s door speaking to Martha, he was in\nthe room close by with the door ajar, preparing to go out. He heard her\nvoice, and immediately came to her.“Do you think that Mrs. Lydgate can receive me this morning?” she said,\nhaving reflected that it would be better to leave out all allusion to\nher previous visit.“I have no doubt she will,” said Lydgate, suppressing his thought about\nDorothea’s looks, which were as much changed as Rosamond’s, “if you\nwill be kind enough to come in and let me tell her that you are here.\nShe has not been very well since you were here yesterday, but she is\nbetter this morning, and I think it is very likely that she will be\ncheered by seeing you again.”It was plain that Lydgate, as Dorothea had expected, knew nothing about\nthe circumstances of her yesterday’s visit; nay, he appeared to imagine\nthat she had carried it out according to her intention. She had\nprepared a little note asking Rosamond to see her, which she would have\ngiven to the servant if he had not been in the way, but now she was in\nmuch anxiety as to the result of his announcement.After leading her into the drawing-room, he paused to take a letter\nfrom his pocket and put it into her hands, saying, “I wrote this last\nnight, and was going to carry it to Lowick in my ride. When one is\ngrateful for something too good for common thanks, writing is less\nunsatisfactory than speech—one does not at least _hear_ how inadequate\nthe words are.”"
