  "content": "Rosamond, with an overmastering pang, as if a wound within her had been\nprobed, burst into hysterical crying as she had done the day before\nwhen she clung to her husband. Poor Dorothea was feeling a great wave\nof her own sorrow returning over her—her thought being drawn to the\npossible share that Will Ladislaw might have in Rosamond’s mental\ntumult. She was beginning to fear that she should not be able to\nsuppress herself enough to the end of this meeting, and while her hand\nwas still resting on Rosamond’s lap, though the hand underneath it was\nwithdrawn, she was struggling against her own rising sobs. She tried to\nmaster herself with the thought that this might be a turning-point in\nthree lives—not in her own; no, there the irrevocable had happened,\nbut—in those three lives which were touching hers with the solemn\nneighborhood of danger and distress. The fragile creature who was\ncrying close to her—there might still be time to rescue her from the\nmisery of false incompatible bonds; and this moment was unlike any\nother: she and Rosamond could never be together again with the same\nthrilling consciousness of yesterday within them both. She felt the\nrelation between them to be peculiar enough to give her a peculiar\ninfluence, though she had no conception that the way in which her own\nfeelings were involved was fully known to Mrs. Lydgate.It was a newer crisis in Rosamond’s experience than even Dorothea could\nimagine: she was under the first great shock that had shattered her\ndream-world in which she had been easily confident of herself and\ncritical of others; and this strange unexpected manifestation of\nfeeling in a woman whom she had approached with a shrinking aversion\nand dread, as one who must necessarily have a jealous hatred towards\nher, made her soul totter all the more with a sense that she had been\nwalking in an unknown world which had just broken in upon her.When Rosamond’s convulsed throat was subsiding into calm, and she\nwithdrew the handkerchief with which she had been hiding her face, her\neyes met Dorothea’s as helplessly as if they had been blue flowers.\nWhat was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying? And\nDorothea looked almost as childish, with the neglected trace of a\nsilent tear. Pride was broken down between these two.“We were talking about your husband,” Dorothea said, with some\ntimidity. “I thought his looks were sadly changed with suffering the\nother day. I had not seen him for many weeks before. He said he had\nbeen feeling very lonely in his trial; but I think he would have borne\nit all better if he had been able to be quite open with you.”“Tertius is so angry and impatient if I say anything,” said Rosamond,\nimagining that he had been complaining of her to Dorothea. “He ought\nnot to wonder that I object to speak to him on painful subjects.”"

  "content": "“It was himself he blamed for not speaking,” said Dorothea. “What he\nsaid of you was, that he could not be happy in doing anything which\nmade you unhappy—that his marriage was of course a bond which must\naffect his choice about everything; and for that reason he refused my\nproposal that he should keep his position at the Hospital, because that\nwould bind him to stay in Middlemarch, and he would not undertake to do\nanything which would be painful to you. He could say that to me,\nbecause he knows that I had much trial in my marriage, from my\nhusband’s illness, which hindered his plans and saddened him; and he\nknows that I have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting\nanother who is tied to us.”Dorothea waited a little; she had discerned a faint pleasure stealing\nover Rosamond’s face. But there was no answer, and she went on, with a\ngathering tremor, “Marriage is so unlike everything else. There is\nsomething even awful in the nearness it brings. Even if we loved some\none else better than—than those we were married to, it would be no\nuse”—poor Dorothea, in her palpitating anxiety, could only seize her\nlanguage brokenly—“I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving\nor getting any blessedness in that sort of love. I know it may be very\ndear—but it murders our marriage—and then the marriage stays with us\nlike a murder—and everything else is gone. And then our husband—if he\nloved and trusted us, and we have not helped him, but made a curse in\nhis life—”Her voice had sunk very low: there was a dread upon her of presuming\ntoo far, and of speaking as if she herself were perfection addressing\nerror. She was too much preoccupied with her own anxiety, to be aware\nthat Rosamond was trembling too; and filled with the need to express\npitying fellowship rather than rebuke, she put her hands on Rosamond’s,\nand said with more agitated rapidity,—“I know, I know that the feeling\nmay be very dear—it has taken hold of us unawares—it is so hard, it may\nseem like death to part with it—and we are weak—I am weak—”The waves of her own sorrow, from out of which she was struggling to\nsave another, rushed over Dorothea with conquering force. She stopped\nin speechless agitation, not crying, but feeling as if she were being\ninwardly grappled. Her face had become of a deathlier paleness, her\nlips trembled, and she pressed her hands helplessly on the hands that\nlay under them."

  "content": "Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her own—hurried\nalong in a new movement which gave all things some new, awful,\nundefined aspect—could find no words, but involuntarily she put her\nlips to Dorothea’s forehead which was very near her, and then for a\nminute the two women clasped each other as if they had been in a\nshipwreck.“You are thinking what is not true,” said Rosamond, in an eager\nhalf-whisper, while she was still feeling Dorothea’s arms round\nher—urged by a mysterious necessity to free herself from something that\noppressed her as if it were blood guiltiness.They moved apart, looking at each other.“When you came in yesterday—it was not as you thought,” said Rosamond\nin the same tone.There was a movement of surprised attention in Dorothea. She expected a\nvindication of Rosamond herself.“He was telling me how he loved another woman, that I might know he\ncould never love me,” said Rosamond, getting more and more hurried as\nshe went on. “And now I think he hates me because—because you mistook\nhim yesterday. He says it is through me that you will think ill of\nhim—think that he is a false person. But it shall not be through me. He\nhas never had any love for me—I know he has not—he has always thought\nslightly of me. He said yesterday that no other woman existed for him\nbeside you. The blame of what happened is entirely mine. He said he\ncould never explain to you—because of me. He said you could never think\nwell of him again. But now I have told you, and he cannot reproach me\nany more.”Rosamond had delivered her soul under impulses which she had not known\nbefore. She had begun her confession under the subduing influence of\nDorothea’s emotion; and as she went on she had gathered the sense that\nshe was repelling Will’s reproaches, which were still like a\nknife-wound within her.The revulsion of feeling in Dorothea was too strong to be called joy.\nIt was a tumult in which the terrible strain of the night and morning\nmade a resistant pain:—she could only perceive that this would be joy\nwhen she had recovered her power of feeling it. Her immediate\nconsciousness was one of immense sympathy without check; she cared for\nRosamond without struggle now, and responded earnestly to her last\nwords—“No, he cannot reproach you any more.”"

  "content": "With her usual tendency to over-estimate the good in others, she felt a\ngreat outgoing of her heart towards Rosamond, for the generous effort\nwhich had redeemed her from suffering, not counting that the effort was\na reflex of her own energy. After they had been silent a little, she\nsaid—“You are not sorry that I came this morning?”“No, you have been very good to me,” said Rosamond. “I did not think\nthat you would be so good. I was very unhappy. I am not happy now.\nEverything is so sad.”“But better days will come. Your husband will be rightly valued. And he\ndepends on you for comfort. He loves you best. The worst loss would be\nto lose that—and you have not lost it,” said Dorothea.She tried to thrust away the too overpowering thought of her own\nrelief, lest she should fail to win some sign that Rosamond’s affection\nwas yearning back towards her husband.“Tertius did not find fault with me, then?” said Rosamond,\nunderstanding now that Lydgate might have said anything to Mrs.\nCasaubon, and that she certainly was different from other women.\nPerhaps there was a faint taste of jealousy in the question. A smile\nbegan to play over Dorothea’s face as she said—“No, indeed! How could you imagine it?” But here the door opened, and\nLydgate entered.“I am come back in my quality of doctor,” he said. “After I went away,\nI was haunted by two pale faces: Mrs. Casaubon looked as much in need\nof care as you, Rosy. And I thought that I had not done my duty in\nleaving you together; so when I had been to Coleman’s I came home\nagain. I noticed that you were walking, Mrs. Casaubon, and the sky has\nchanged—I think we may have rain. May I send some one to order your\ncarriage to come for you?”“Oh, no! I am strong: I need the walk,” said Dorothea, rising with\nanimation in her face. “Mrs. Lydgate and I have chatted a great deal,\nand it is time for me to go. I have always been accused of being\nimmoderate and saying too much.”She put out her hand to Rosamond, and they said an earnest, quiet\ngood-by without kiss or other show of effusion: there had been between\nthem too much serious emotion for them to use the signs of it\nsuperficially."

If you go to talk to her so often, you will be more\ndiscontented with me than ever!”Lydgate laughed at the “so often.” “But has she made you any less\ndiscontented with me?”“I think she has,” said Rosamond, looking up in his face. “How heavy\nyour eyes are, Tertius—and do push your hair back.” He lifted up his\nlarge white hand to obey her, and felt thankful for this little mark of\ninterest in him. Poor Rosamond’s vagrant fancy had come back terribly\nscourged—meek enough to nestle under the old despised shelter. And the\nshelter was still there: Lydgate had accepted his narrowed lot with sad\nresignation. He had chosen this fragile creature, and had taken the\nburthen of her life upon his arms. He must walk as he could, carrying\nthat burthen pitifully.CHAPTER LXXXII.“My grief lies onward and my joy behind.”\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_."

  "content": "Exiles notoriously feed much on hopes, and are unlikely to stay in\nbanishment unless they are obliged. When Will Ladislaw exiled himself\nfrom Middlemarch he had placed no stronger obstacle to his return than\nhis own resolve, which was by no means an iron barrier, but simply a\nstate of mind liable to melt into a minuet with other states of mind,\nand to find itself bowing, smiling, and giving place with polite\nfacility. As the months went on, it had seemed more and more difficult\nto him to say why he should not run down to Middlemarch—merely for the\nsake of hearing something about Dorothea; and if on such a flying visit\nhe should chance by some strange coincidence to meet with her, there\nwas no reason for him to be ashamed of having taken an innocent journey\nwhich he had beforehand supposed that he should not take. Since he was\nhopelessly divided from her, he might surely venture into her\nneighborhood; and as to the suspicious friends who kept a dragon watch\nover her—their opinions seemed less and less important with time and\nchange of air.And there had come a reason quite irrespective of Dorothea, which\nseemed to make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of philanthropic duty.\nWill had given a disinterested attention to an intended settlement on a\nnew plan in the Far West, and the need for funds in order to carry out\na good design had set him on debating with himself whether it would not\nbe a laudable use to make of his claim on Bulstrode, to urge the\napplication of that money which had been offered to himself as a means\nof carrying out a scheme likely to be largely beneficial. The question\nseemed a very dubious one to Will, and his repugnance to again entering\ninto any relation with the banker might have made him dismiss it\nquickly, if there had not arisen in his imagination the probability\nthat his judgment might be more safely determined by a visit to\nMiddlemarch.That was the object which Will stated to himself as a reason for coming\ndown. He had meant to confide in Lydgate, and discuss the money\nquestion with him, and he had meant to amuse himself for the few\nevenings of his stay by having a great deal of music and badinage with\nfair Rosamond, without neglecting his friends at Lowick Parsonage:—if\nthe Parsonage was close to the Manor, that was no fault of his. He had\nneglected the Farebrothers before his departure, from a proud\nresistance to the possible accusation of indirectly seeking interviews\nwith Dorothea; but hunger tames us, and Will had become very hungry for\nthe vision of a certain form and the sound of a certain voice. Nothing\nhad done instead—not the opera, or the converse of zealous politicians,\nor the flattering reception (in dim corners) of his new hand in leading\narticles."

  "content": "Thus he had come down, foreseeing with confidence how almost everything\nwould be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed, that there\nwould be no surprises in his visit. But he had found that humdrum world\nin a terribly dynamic condition, in which even badinage and lyrism had\nturned explosive; and the first day of this visit had become the most\nfatal epoch of his life. The next morning he felt so harassed with the\nnightmare of consequences—he dreaded so much the immediate issues\nbefore him—that seeing while he breakfasted the arrival of the\nRiverston coach, he went out hurriedly and took his place on it, that\nhe might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing\nor saying anything in Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those\ntangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine,\nfrom the shallow absoluteness of men’s judgments. He had found Lydgate,\nfor whom he had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which\nclaimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why,\nin spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will to have\navoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was\nprecisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To a\ncreature of Will’s susceptible temperament—without any neutral region\nof indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him\ninto the collisions of a passionate drama—the revelation that Rosamond\nhad made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty\nwhich his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for\nhim. He hated his own cruelty, and yet he dreaded to show the fulness\nof his relenting: he must go to her again; the friendship could not be\nput to a sudden end; and her unhappiness was a power which he dreaded.\nAnd all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life\nbefore him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his\nfresh start on crutches. In the night he had debated whether he should\nnot get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note\nto Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat. But\nthere were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure:\nthe blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of\nthat chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged\nnecessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for him to resign\nhimself to it and go straightway into a distance which was also\ndespair."

He\ncame back again by it while it was still daylight, having made up his\nmind that he must go to Lydgate’s that evening. The Rubicon, we know,\nwas a very insignificant stream to look at; its significance lay\nentirely in certain invisible conditions. Will felt as if he were\nforced to cross his small boundary ditch, and what he saw beyond it was\nnot empire, but discontented subjection.But it is given to us sometimes even in our every-day life to witness\nthe saving influence of a noble nature, the divine efficacy of rescue\nthat may lie in a self-subduing act of fellowship. If Dorothea, after\nher night’s anguish, had not taken that walk to Rosamond—why, she\nperhaps would have been a woman who gained a higher character for\ndiscretion, but it would certainly not have been as well for those\nthree who were on one hearth in Lydgate’s house at half-past seven that\nevening."

And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of work, he\ninnocently apologized for her in an indirect way by begging her to lean\nbackward and rest. Will was miserable in the necessity for playing the\npart of a friend who was making his first appearance and greeting to\nRosamond, while his thoughts were busy about her feeling since that\nscene of yesterday, which seemed still inexorably to enclose them both,\nlike the painful vision of a double madness. It happened that nothing\ncalled Lydgate out of the room; but when Rosamond poured out the tea,\nand Will came near to fetch it, she placed a tiny bit of folded paper\nin his saucer. He saw it and secured it quickly, but as he went back to\nhis inn he had no eagerness to unfold the paper. What Rosamond had\nwritten to him would probably deepen the painful impressions of the\nevening. Still, he opened and read it by his bed-candle. There were\nonly these few words in her neatly flowing hand:—“I have told Mrs. Casaubon. She is not under any mistake about you. I\ntold her because she came to see me and was very kind. You will have\nnothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made any difference\nto you.”The effect of these words was not quite all gladness. As Will dwelt on\nthem with excited imagination, he felt his cheeks and ears burning at\nthe thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond—at the\nuncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her dignity wounded in\nhaving an explanation of his conduct offered to her. There might still\nremain in her mind a changed association with him which made an\nirremediable difference—a lasting flaw. With active fancy he wrought\nhimself into a state of doubt little more easy than that of the man who\nhas escaped from wreck by night and stands on unknown ground in the\ndarkness. Until that wretched yesterday—except the moment of vexation\nlong ago in the very same room and in the very same presence—all their\nvision, all their thought of each other, had been as in a world apart,\nwhere the sunshine fell on tall white lilies, where no evil lurked, and\nno other soul entered. But now—would Dorothea meet him in that world\nagain?CHAPTER LXXXIII.“And now good-morrow to our waking souls\nWhich watch not one another out of fear;\nFor love all love of other sights controls,\nAnd makes one little room, an everywhere.”\n—DR.

  "content": "On the second morning after Dorothea’s visit to Rosamond, she had had\ntwo nights of sound sleep, and had not only lost all traces of fatigue,\nbut felt as if she had a great deal of superfluous strength—that is to\nsay, more strength than she could manage to concentrate on any\noccupation. The day before, she had taken long walks outside the\ngrounds, and had paid two visits to the Parsonage; but she never in her\nlife told any one the reason why she spent her time in that fruitless\nmanner, and this morning she was rather angry with herself for her\nchildish restlessness. To-day was to be spent quite differently. What\nwas there to be done in the village? Oh dear! nothing. Everybody was\nwell and had flannel; nobody’s pig had died; and it was Saturday\nmorning, when there was a general scrubbing of doors and door-stones,\nand when it was useless to go into the school. But there were various\nsubjects that Dorothea was trying to get clear upon, and she resolved\nto throw herself energetically into the gravest of all. She sat down in\nthe library before her particular little heap of books on political\neconomy and kindred matters, out of which she was trying to get light\nas to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one’s\nneighbors, or—what comes to the same thing—so as to do them the most\ngood. Here was a weighty subject which, if she could but lay hold of\nit, would certainly keep her mind steady. Unhappily her mind slipped\noff it for a whole hour; and at the end she found herself reading\nsentences twice over with an intense consciousness of many things, but\nnot of any one thing contained in the text. This was hopeless. Should\nshe order the carriage and drive to Tipton? No; for some reason or\nother she preferred staying at Lowick. But her vagrant mind must be\nreduced to order: there was an art in self-discipline; and she walked\nround and round the brown library considering by what sort of manoeuvre\nshe could arrest her wandering thoughts. Perhaps a mere task was the\nbest means—something to which she must go doggedly. Was there not the\ngeography of Asia Minor, in which her slackness had often been rebuked\nby Mr. Casaubon? She went to the cabinet of maps and unrolled one: this\nmorning she might make herself finally sure that Paphlagonia was not on\nthe Levantine coast, and fix her total darkness about the Chalybes\nfirmly on the shores of the Euxine. A map was a fine thing to study\nwhen you were disposed to think of something else, being made up of\nnames that would turn into a chime if you went back upon them. Dorothea\nset earnestly to work, bending close to her map, and uttering the names\nin an audible, subdued tone, which often got into a chime. She looked\namusingly girlish after all her deep experience—nodding her head and\nmarking the names off on her fingers, with a little pursing of her lip,\nand now and then breaking off to put her hands on each side of her face\nand say, “Oh dear! oh dear!”"

I shall be so glad if I can do anything.”“I will not stay,” said Miss Noble, putting her hand into her small\nbasket, and holding some article inside it nervously; “I have left a\nfriend in the churchyard.” She lapsed into her inarticulate sounds, and\nunconsciously drew forth the article which she was fingering. It was\nthe tortoise-shell lozenge-box, and Dorothea felt the color mounting to\nher cheeks.“Mr. Ladislaw,” continued the timid little woman. “He fears he has\noffended you, and has begged me to ask if you will see him for a few\nminutes.”Dorothea did not answer on the instant: it was crossing her mind that\nshe could not receive him in this library, where her husband’s\nprohibition seemed to dwell. She looked towards the window. Could she\ngo out and meet him in the grounds? The sky was heavy, and the trees\nhad begun to shiver as at a coming storm. Besides, she shrank from\ngoing out to him.“Do see him, Mrs. Casaubon,” said Miss Noble, pathetically; “else I\nmust go back and say No, and that will hurt him.”“Yes, I will see him,” said Dorothea. “Pray tell him to come.”What else was there to be done? There was nothing that she longed for\nat that moment except to see Will: the possibility of seeing him had\nthrust itself insistently between her and every other object; and yet\nshe had a throbbing excitement like an alarm upon her—a sense that she\nwas doing something daringly defiant for his sake."

What she was least conscious of just then was her own\nbody: she was thinking of what was likely to be in Will’s mind, and of\nthe hard feelings that others had had about him. How could any duty\nbind her to hardness? Resistance to unjust dispraise had mingled with\nher feeling for him from the very first, and now in the rebound of her\nheart after her anguish the resistance was stronger than ever. “If I\nlove him too much it is because he has been used so ill:”—there was a\nvoice within her saying this to some imagined audience in the library,\nwhen the door was opened, and she saw Will before her.She did not move, and he came towards her with more doubt and timidity\nin his face than she had ever seen before. He was in a state of\nuncertainty which made him afraid lest some look or word of his should\ncondemn him to a new distance from her; and Dorothea was afraid of her\n_own_ emotion. She looked as if there were a spell upon her, keeping\nher motionless and hindering her from unclasping her hands, while some\nintense, grave yearning was imprisoned within her eyes. Seeing that she\ndid not put out her hand as usual, Will paused a yard from her and said\nwith embarrassment, “I am so grateful to you for seeing me.”“I wanted to see you,” said Dorothea, having no other words at command.\nIt did not occur to her to sit down, and Will did not give a cheerful\ninterpretation to this queenly way of receiving him; but he went on to\nsay what he had made up his mind to say.“I fear you think me foolish and perhaps wrong for coming back so soon.\nI have been punished for my impatience. You know—every one knows now—a\npainful story about my parentage. I knew of it before I went away, and\nI always meant to tell you of it if—if we ever met again.”There was a slight movement in Dorothea, and she unclasped her hands,\nbut immediately folded them over each other.“But the affair is matter of gossip now,” Will continued. “I wished you\nto know that something connected with it—something which happened\nbefore I went away, helped to bring me down here again. At least I\nthought it excused my coming. It was the idea of getting Bulstrode to\napply some money to a public purpose—some money which he had thought of\ngiving me. Perhaps it is rather to Bulstrode’s credit that he privately\noffered me compensation for an old injury: he offered to give me a good\nincome to make amends; but I suppose you know the disagreeable story?”"

He added, “You know that it must be altogether painful to me.”“Yes—yes—I know,” said Dorothea, hastily.“I did not choose to accept an income from such a source. I was sure\nthat you would not think well of me if I did so,” said Will. Why should\nhe mind saying anything of that sort to her now? She knew that he had\navowed his love for her. “I felt that”—he broke off, nevertheless.“You acted as I should have expected you to act,” said Dorothea, her\nface brightening and her head becoming a little more erect on its\nbeautiful stem.“I did not believe that you would let any circumstance of my birth\ncreate a prejudice in you against me, though it was sure to do so in\nothers,” said Will, shaking his head backward in his old way, and\nlooking with a grave appeal into her eyes.“If it were a new hardship it would be a new reason for me to cling to\nyou,” said Dorothea, fervidly. “Nothing could have changed me but—” her\nheart was swelling, and it was difficult to go on; she made a great\neffort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice, “but thinking that\nyou were different—not so good as I had believed you to be.”“You are sure to believe me better than I am in everything but one,”\nsaid Will, giving way to his own feeling in the evidence of hers. “I\nmean, in my truth to you. When I thought you doubted of that, I didn’t\ncare about anything that was left. I thought it was all over with me,\nand there was nothing to try for—only things to endure.”“I don’t doubt you any longer,” said Dorothea, putting out her hand; a\nvague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection.He took her hand and raised it to his lips with something like a sob.\nBut he stood with his hat and gloves in the other hand, and might have\ndone for the portrait of a Royalist. Still it was difficult to loose\nthe hand, and Dorothea, withdrawing it in a confusion that distressed\nher, looked and moved away.“See how dark the clouds have become, and how the trees are tossed,”\nshe said, walking towards the window, yet speaking and moving with only\na dim sense of what she was doing."

He was not much afraid of anything that she might feel now.They stood silent, not looking at each other, but looking at the\nevergreens which were being tossed, and were showing the pale underside\nof their leaves against the blackening sky. Will never enjoyed the\nprospect of a storm so much: it delivered him from the necessity of\ngoing away. Leaves and little branches were hurled about, and the\nthunder was getting nearer. The light was more and more sombre, but\nthere came a flash of lightning which made them start and look at each\nother, and then smile. Dorothea began to say what she had been thinking\nof.“That was a wrong thing for you to say, that you would have had nothing\nto try for. If we had lost our own chief good, other people’s good\nwould remain, and that is worth trying for. Some can be happy. I seemed\nto see that more clearly than ever, when I was the most wretched. I can\nhardly think how I could have borne the trouble, if that feeling had\nnot come to me to make strength.”“You have never felt the sort of misery I felt,” said Will; “the misery\nof knowing that you must despise me.”“But I have felt worse—it was worse to think ill—” Dorothea had begun\nimpetuously, but broke off.Will colored. He had the sense that whatever she said was uttered in\nthe vision of a fatality that kept them apart.

Since I must go away—since we must always be divided—you may\nthink of me as one on the brink of the grave.”"

Dorothea darted instantaneously from the window; Will\nfollowed her, seizing her hand with a spasmodic movement; and so they\nstood, with their hands clasped, like two children, looking out on the\nstorm, while the thunder gave a tremendous crack and roll above them,\nand the rain began to pour down. Then they turned their faces towards\neach other, with the memory of his last words in them, and they did not\nloose each other’s hands.“There is no hope for me,” said Will. “Even if you loved me as well as\nI love you—even if I were everything to you—I shall most likely always\nbe very poor: on a sober calculation, one can count on nothing but a\ncreeping lot. It is impossible for us ever to belong to each other. It\nis perhaps base of me to have asked for a word from you. I meant to go\naway into silence, but I have not been able to do what I meant.”“Don’t be sorry,” said Dorothea, in her clear tender tones. “I would\nrather share all the trouble of our parting.”Her lips trembled, and so did his. It was never known which lips were\nthe first to move towards the other lips; but they kissed tremblingly,\nand then they moved apart.The rain was dashing against the window-panes as if an angry spirit\nwere within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the wind; it was\none of those moments in which both the busy and the idle pause with a\ncertain awe.Dorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her, a long low ottoman in the\nmiddle of the room, and with her hands folded over each other on her\nlap, looked at the drear outer world. Will stood still an instant\nlooking at her, then seated himself beside her, and laid his hand on\nhers, which turned itself upward to be clasped. They sat in that way\nwithout looking at each other, until the rain abated and began to fall\nin stillness. Each had been full of thoughts which neither of them\ncould begin to utter.But when the rain was quiet, Dorothea turned to look at Will. With\npassionate exclamation, as if some torture screw were threatening him,\nhe started up and said, “It is impossible!”He went and leaned on the back of the chair again, and seemed to be\nbattling with his own anger, while she looked towards him sadly.“It is as fatal as a murder or any other horror that divides people,”\nhe burst out again; “it is more intolerable—to have our life maimed by\npetty accidents.”“No—don’t say that—your life need not be maimed,” said Dorothea,\ngently."

  "content": "“Yes, it must,” said Will, angrily. “It is cruel of you to speak in\nthat way—as if there were any comfort. You may see beyond the misery of\nit, but I don’t. It is unkind—it is throwing back my love for you as if\nit were a trifle, to speak in that way in the face of the fact. We can\nnever be married.”“Some time—we might,” said Dorothea, in a trembling voice.“When?” said Will, bitterly. “What is the use of counting on any\nsuccess of mine? It is a mere toss up whether I shall ever do more than\nkeep myself decently, unless I choose to sell myself as a mere pen and\na mouthpiece. I can see that clearly enough. I could not offer myself\nto any woman, even if she had no luxuries to renounce.”There was silence. Dorothea’s heart was full of something that she\nwanted to say, and yet the words were too difficult. She was wholly\npossessed by them: at that moment debate was mute within her. And it\nwas very hard that she could not say what she wanted to say. Will was\nlooking out of the window angrily. If he would have looked at her and\nnot gone away from her side, she thought everything would have been\neasier. At last he turned, still resting against the chair, and\nstretching his hand automatically towards his hat, said with a sort of\nexasperation, “Good-by.”“Oh, I cannot bear it—my heart will break,” said Dorothea, starting\nfrom her seat, the flood of her young passion bearing down all the\nobstructions which had kept her silent—the great tears rising and\nfalling in an instant: “I don’t mind about poverty—I hate my wealth.”In an instant Will was close to her and had his arms round her, but she\ndrew her head back and held his away gently that she might go on\nspeaking, her large tear-filled eyes looking at his very simply, while\nshe said in a sobbing childlike way, “We could live quite well on my\nown fortune—it is too much—seven hundred a-year—I want so little—no new\nclothes—and I will learn what everything costs.”CHAPTER LXXXIV.“Though it be songe of old and yonge,\n    That I sholde be to blame,\nTheyrs be the charge, that spoke so large\n    In hurtynge of my name.”\n—_The Not-Browne Mayde_."

  "content": "It was just after the Lords had thrown out the Reform Bill: that\nexplains how Mr. Cadwallader came to be walking on the slope of the\nlawn near the great conservatory at Freshitt Hall, holding the “Times”\nin his hands behind him, while he talked with a trout-fisher’s\ndispassionateness about the prospects of the country to Sir James\nChettam. Mrs. Cadwallader, the Dowager Lady Chettam, and Celia were\nsometimes seated on garden-chairs, sometimes walking to meet little\nArthur, who was being drawn in his chariot, and, as became the\ninfantine Bouddha, was sheltered by his sacred umbrella with handsome\nsilken fringe.The ladies also talked politics, though more fitfully. Mrs. Cadwallader\nwas strong on the intended creation of peers: she had it for certain\nfrom her cousin that Truberry had gone over to the other side entirely\nat the instigation of his wife, who had scented peerages in the air\nfrom the very first introduction of the Reform question, and would sign\nher soul away to take precedence of her younger sister, who had married\na baronet. Lady Chettam thought that such conduct was very\nreprehensible, and remembered that Mrs. Truberry’s mother was a Miss\nWalsingham of Melspring. Celia confessed it was nicer to be “Lady” than\n“Mrs.,” and that Dodo never minded about precedence if she could have\nher own way. Mrs. Cadwallader held that it was a poor satisfaction to\ntake precedence when everybody about you knew that you had not a drop\nof good blood in your veins; and Celia again, stopping to look at\nArthur, said, “It would be very nice, though, if he were a Viscount—and\nhis lordship’s little tooth coming through! He might have been, if\nJames had been an Earl.”“My dear Celia,” said the Dowager, “James’s title is worth far more\nthan any new earldom. I never wished his father to be anything else\nthan Sir James.”“Oh, I only meant about Arthur’s little tooth,” said Celia,\ncomfortably. “But see, here is my uncle coming.”She tripped off to meet her uncle, while Sir James and Mr. Cadwallader\ncame forward to make one group with the ladies. Celia had slipped her\narm through her uncle’s, and he patted her hand with a rather\nmelancholy “Well, my dear!” As they approached, it was evident that Mr.\nBrooke was looking dejected, but this was fully accounted for by the\nstate of politics; and as he was shaking hands all round without more\ngreeting than a “Well, you’re all here, you know,” the Rector said,\nlaughingly—“Don’t take the throwing out of the Bill so much to heart, Brooke;\nyou’ve got all the riff-raff of the country on your side.”"

I mean, here at home—sad\nnews. But you must not blame me, Chettam.”“What is the matter?” said Sir James. “Not another gamekeeper shot, I\nhope? It’s what I should expect, when a fellow like Trapping Bass is\nlet off so easily.”“Gamekeeper? No. Let us go in; I can tell you all in the house, you\nknow,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding at the Cadwalladers, to show that he\nincluded them in his confidence. “As to poachers like Trapping Bass,\nyou know, Chettam,” he continued, as they were entering, “when you are\na magistrate, you’ll not find it so easy to commit. Severity is all\nvery well, but it’s a great deal easier when you’ve got somebody to do\nit for you. You have a soft place in your heart yourself, you\nknow—you’re not a Draco, a Jeffreys, that sort of thing.”Mr. Brooke was evidently in a state of nervous perturbation. When he\nhad something painful to tell, it was usually his way to introduce it\namong a number of disjointed particulars, as if it were a medicine that\nwould get a milder flavor by mixing. He continued his chat with Sir\nJames about the poachers until they were all seated, and Mrs.\nCadwallader, impatient of this drivelling, said—“I’m dying to know the sad news. The gamekeeper is not shot: that is\nsettled. What is it, then?”“Well, it’s a very trying thing, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “I’m glad\nyou and the Rector are here; it’s a family matter—but you will help us\nall to bear it, Cadwallader. I’ve got to break it to you, my dear.”\nHere Mr. Brooke looked at Celia—“You’ve no notion what it is, you know.\nAnd, Chettam, it will annoy you uncommonly—but, you see, you have not\nbeen able to hinder it, any more than I have. There’s something\nsingular in things: they come round, you know.”“It must be about Dodo,” said Celia, who had been used to think of her\nsister as the dangerous part of the family machinery. She had seated\nherself on a low stool against her husband’s knee.“For God’s sake let us hear what it is!” said Sir James.“Well, you know, Chettam, I couldn’t help Casaubon’s will: it was a\nsort of will to make things worse.”"

  "content": "“Exactly,” said Sir James, hastily. “But _what_ is worse?”“Dorothea is going to be married again, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,\nnodding towards Celia, who immediately looked up at her husband with a\nfrightened glance, and put her hand on his knee. Sir James was almost\nwhite with anger, but he did not speak.“Merciful heaven!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Not to _young_ Ladislaw?”Mr. Brooke nodded, saying, “Yes; to Ladislaw,” and then fell into a\nprudential silence.“You see, Humphrey!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her arm towards her\nhusband. “Another time you will admit that I have some foresight; or\nrather you will contradict me and be just as blind as ever. _You_\nsupposed that the young gentleman was gone out of the country.”“So he might be, and yet come back,” said the Rector, quietly.“When did you learn this?” said Sir James, not liking to hear any one\nelse speak, though finding it difficult to speak himself.“Yesterday,” said Mr. Brooke, meekly. “I went to Lowick. Dorothea sent\nfor me, you know. It had come about quite suddenly—neither of them had\nany idea two days ago—not any idea, you know. There’s something\nsingular in things. But Dorothea is quite determined—it is no use\nopposing. I put it strongly to her. I did my duty, Chettam. But she can\nact as she likes, you know.”“It would have been better if I had called him out and shot him a year\nago,” said Sir James, not from bloody-mindedness, but because he needed\nsomething strong to say.“Really, James, that would have been very disagreeable,” said Celia.“Be reasonable, Chettam. Look at the affair more quietly,” said Mr.\nCadwallader, sorry to see his good-natured friend so overmastered by\nanger."

  "content": "“That is not so very easy for a man of any dignity—with any sense of\nright—when the affair happens to be in his own family,” said Sir James,\nstill in his white indignation. “It is perfectly scandalous. If\nLadislaw had had a spark of honor he would have gone out of the country\nat once, and never shown his face in it again. However, I am not\nsurprised. The day after Casaubon’s funeral I said what ought to be\ndone. But I was not listened to.”“You wanted what was impossible, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke.\n“You wanted him shipped off. I told you Ladislaw was not to be done as\nwe liked with: he had his ideas. He was a remarkable fellow—I always\nsaid he was a remarkable fellow.”“Yes,” said Sir James, unable to repress a retort, “it is rather a pity\nyou formed that high opinion of him. We are indebted to that for his\nbeing lodged in this neighborhood. We are indebted to that for seeing a\nwoman like Dorothea degrading herself by marrying him.” Sir James made\nlittle stoppages between his clauses, the words not coming easily. “A\nman so marked out by her husband’s will, that delicacy ought to have\nforbidden her from seeing him again—who takes her out of her proper\nrank—into poverty—has the meanness to accept such a sacrifice—has\nalways had an objectionable position—a bad origin—and, _I believe_, is\na man of little principle and light character. That is my opinion.” Sir\nJames ended emphatically, turning aside and crossing his leg.“I pointed everything out to her,” said Mr. Brooke, apologetically—“I\nmean the poverty, and abandoning her position. I said, ‘My dear, you\ndon’t know what it is to live on seven hundred a-year, and have no\ncarriage, and that kind of thing, and go amongst people who don’t know\nwho you are.’ I put it strongly to her. But I advise you to talk to\nDorothea herself. The fact is, she has a dislike to Casaubon’s\nproperty. You will hear what she says, you know.”“No—excuse me—I shall not,” said Sir James, with more coolness. “I\ncannot bear to see her again; it is too painful. It hurts me too much\nthat a woman like Dorothea should have done what is wrong.”"

  "content": "“Be just, Chettam,” said the easy, large-lipped Rector, who objected to\nall this unnecessary discomfort. “Mrs. Casaubon may be acting\nimprudently: she is giving up a fortune for the sake of a man, and we\nmen have so poor an opinion of each other that we can hardly call a\nwoman wise who does that. But I think you should not condemn it as a\nwrong action, in the strict sense of the word.”“Yes, I do,” answered Sir James. “I think that Dorothea commits a wrong\naction in marrying Ladislaw.”“My dear fellow, we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it\nis unpleasant to us,” said the Rector, quietly. Like many men who take\nlife easily, he had the knack of saying a home truth occasionally to\nthose who felt themselves virtuously out of temper. Sir James took out\nhis handkerchief and began to bite the corner.“It is very dreadful of Dodo, though,” said Celia, wishing to justify\nher husband. “She said she _never would_ marry again—not anybody at\nall.”“I heard her say the same thing myself,” said Lady Chettam,\nmajestically, as if this were royal evidence.“Oh, there is usually a silent exception in such cases,” said Mrs.\nCadwallader. “The only wonder to me is, that any of you are surprised.\nYou did nothing to hinder it. If you would have had Lord Triton down\nhere to woo her with his philanthropy, he might have carried her off\nbefore the year was over. There was no safety in anything else. Mr.\nCasaubon had prepared all this as beautifully as possible. He made\nhimself disagreeable—or it pleased God to make him so—and then he dared\nher to contradict him. It’s the way to make any trumpery tempting, to\nticket it at a high price in that way.”“I don’t know what you mean by wrong, Cadwallader,” said Sir James,\nstill feeling a little stung, and turning round in his chair towards\nthe Rector. “He’s not a man we can take into the family. At least, I\nmust speak for myself,” he continued, carefully keeping his eyes off\nMr. Brooke. “I suppose others will find his society too pleasant to\ncare about the propriety of the thing.”“Well, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke, good-humoredly, nursing his\nleg, “I can’t turn my back on Dorothea. I must be a father to her up to\na certain point. I said, ‘My dear, I won’t refuse to give you away.’ I\nhad spoken strongly before. But I can cut off the entail, you know. It\nwill cost money and be troublesome; but I can do it, you know.”"
