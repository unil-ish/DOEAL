  "content": "“Well, now I may go on. Fred, you know, has taken his degree. He has\nworked his way so far, and now the question is, what is he to do? That\nquestion is so difficult that he is inclined to follow his father’s\nwishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that he\nwas quite set against that formerly. I have questioned him on the\nsubject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to his being a\nclergyman, as things go. He says that he could turn his mind to doing\nhis best in that vocation, on one condition. If that condition were\nfulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred on. After a time—not, of\ncourse, at first—he might be with me as my curate, and he would have so\nmuch to do that his stipend would be nearly what I used to get as\nvicar. But I repeat that there is a condition without which all this\ngood cannot come to pass. He has opened his heart to me, Miss Garth,\nand asked me to plead for him. The condition lies entirely in your\nfeeling.”Mary looked so much moved, that he said after a moment, “Let us walk a\nlittle;” and when they were walking he added, “To speak quite plainly,\nFred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you\nwould consent to be his wife; but with that prospect, he will try his\nbest at anything you approve.”“I cannot possibly say that I will ever be his wife, Mr. Farebrother:\nbut I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman. What\nyou say is most generous and kind; I don’t mean for a moment to correct\nyour judgment. It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of\nlooking at things,” said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness\nin her answer which only made its modesty more charming.“He wishes me to report exactly what you think,” said Mr. Farebrother.“I could not love a man who is ridiculous,” said Mary, not choosing to\ngo deeper. “Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make him\nrespectable, if he likes, in some good worldly business, but I can\nnever imagine him preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings,\nand praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a\ncaricature. His being a clergyman would be only for gentility’s sake,\nand I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile\ngentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and\nneat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men to\nrepresent Christianity—as if it were an institution for getting up\nidiots genteelly—as if—” Mary checked herself. She had been carried\nalong as if she had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother.“Young women are severe: they don’t feel the stress of action as men\ndo, though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there. But you\ndon’t put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?”“No, indeed, he has plenty of sense, but I think he would not show it\nas a clergyman. He would be a piece of professional affectation.”“Then the answer is quite decided. As a clergyman he could have no\nhope?”"

  "content": "Mary shook her head.“But if he braved all the difficulties of getting his bread in some\nother way—will you give him the support of hope? May he count on\nwinning you?”“I think Fred ought not to need telling again what I have already said\nto him,” Mary answered, with a slight resentment in her manner. “I mean\nthat he ought not to put such questions until he has done something\nworthy, instead of saying that he could do it.”Mr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more, and then, as they\nturned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy\nwalk, said, “I understand that you resist any attempt to fetter you,\nbut either your feeling for Fred Vincy excludes your entertaining\nanother attachment, or it does not: either he may count on your\nremaining single until he shall have earned your hand, or he may in any\ncase be disappointed. Pardon me, Mary—you know I used to catechise you\nunder that name—but when the state of a woman’s affections touches the\nhappiness of another life—of more lives than one—I think it would be\nthe nobler course for her to be perfectly direct and open.”Mary in her turn was silent, wondering not at Mr. Farebrother’s manner\nbut at his tone, which had a grave restrained emotion in it. When the\nstrange idea flashed across her that his words had reference to\nhimself, she was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it. She had\nnever thought that any man could love her except Fred, who had espoused\nher with the umbrella ring, when she wore socks and little strapped\nshoes; still less that she could be of any importance to Mr.\nFarebrother, the cleverest man in her narrow circle. She had only time\nto feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory; but one thing was\nclear and determined—her answer."

  "content": "“Since you think it my duty, Mr. Farebrother, I will tell you that I\nhave too strong a feeling for Fred to give him up for any one else. I\nshould never be quite happy if I thought he was unhappy for the loss of\nme. It has taken such deep root in me—my gratitude to him for always\nloving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time\nwhen we were very little. I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to\nmake that weaker. I should like better than anything to see him worthy\nof every one’s respect. But please tell him I will not promise to marry\nhim till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother. He is\nfree to choose some one else.”“Then I have fulfilled my commission thoroughly,” said Mr. Farebrother,\nputting out his hand to Mary, “and I shall ride back to Middlemarch\nforthwith. With this prospect before him, we shall get Fred into the\nright niche somehow, and I hope I shall live to join your hands. God\nbless you!”“Oh, please stay, and let me give you some tea,” said Mary. Her eyes\nfilled with tears, for something indefinable, something like the\nresolute suppression of a pain in Mr. Farebrother’s manner, made her\nfeel suddenly miserable, as she had once felt when she saw her father’s\nhands trembling in a moment of trouble.“No, my dear, no. I must get back.”In three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again, having gone\nmagnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of\nwhist, or even than the writing of penitential meditations.CHAPTER LIII.It is but a shallow haste which concludeth insincerity from what\noutsiders call inconsistency—putting a dead mechanism of “ifs” and\n“therefores” for the living myriad of hidden suckers whereby the belief\nand the conduct are wrought into mutual sustainment."

  "content": "Mr. Bulstrode, when he was hoping to acquire a new interest in Lowick,\nhad naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman should be one\nwhom he thoroughly approved; and he believed it to be a chastisement\nand admonition directed to his own shortcomings and those of the nation\nat large, that just about the time when he came in possession of the\ndeeds which made him the proprietor of Stone Court, Mr. Farebrother\n“read himself” into the quaint little church and preached his first\nsermon to the congregation of farmers, laborers, and village artisans.\nIt was not that Mr. Bulstrode intended to frequent Lowick Church or to\nreside at Stone Court for a good while to come: he had bought the\nexcellent farm and fine homestead simply as a retreat which he might\ngradually enlarge as to the land and beautify as to the dwelling, until\nit should be conducive to the divine glory that he should enter on it\nas a residence, partially withdrawing from his present exertions in the\nadministration of business, and throwing more conspicuously on the side\nof Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship, which\nProvidence might increase by unforeseen occasions of purchase. A strong\nleading in this direction seemed to have been given in the surprising\nfacility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected that Mr.\nRigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of Eden. That\nwas what poor old Peter himself had expected; having often, in\nimagination, looked up through the sods above him, and, unobstructed by\nperspective, seen his frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old place to\nthe perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors.But how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors! We\njudge from our own desires, and our neighbors themselves are not always\nopen enough even to throw out a hint of theirs. The cool and judicious\nJoshua Rigg had not allowed his parent to perceive that Stone Court was\nanything less than the chief good in his estimation, and he had\ncertainly wished to call it his own. But as Warren Hastings looked at\ngold and thought of buying Daylesford, so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone\nCourt and thought of buying gold. He had a very distinct and intense\nvision of his chief good, the vigorous greed which he had inherited\nhaving taken a special form by dint of circumstance: and his chief good\nwas to be a moneychanger. From his earliest employment as an errand-boy\nin a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers as\nother boys look through the windows of the pastry-cooks; the\nfascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep special passion;\nhe meant, when he had property, to do many things, one of them being to\nmarry a genteel young person; but these were all accidents and joys\nthat imagination could dispense with. The one joy after which his soul\nthirsted was to have a money-changer’s shop on a much-frequented quay,\nto have locks all round him of which he held the keys, and to look\nsublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations, while\nhelpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the other side of an\niron lattice. The strength of that passion had been a power enabling\nhim to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it. And when\nothers were thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for life,\nJoshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off when he\nshould settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in safes and\nlocks."

  "content": "Enough. We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg’s sale of his land\nfrom Mr. Bulstrode’s point of view, and he interpreted it as a cheering\ndispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for\nsome time entertained without external encouragement; he interpreted it\nthus, but not too confidently, offering up his thanksgiving in guarded\nphraseology. His doubts did not arise from the possible relations of\nthe event to Joshua Rigg’s destiny, which belonged to the unmapped\nregions not taken under the providential government, except perhaps in\nan imperfect colonial way; but they arose from reflecting that this\ndispensation too might be a chastisement for himself, as Mr.\nFarebrother’s induction to the living clearly was.This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of\ndeceiving him: it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely his\nmode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen\nto disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our theories\ndoes not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is\nsatisfied, the more robust is our belief.However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,\nhardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become\nthe proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say “if he were\nworthy to know,” had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of\nconversation to his disappointed relatives. The tables were now turned\non that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of\nhis cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of\ndelight to Solomon. Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof\nthat it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the\ngenuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said,\n“Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so pleased with the\nalmshouses after all.”Affectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage\nwhich her husband’s health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone\nCourt. Few days passed without his riding thither and looking over some\npart of the farm with the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious in\nthat quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks lately set up were sending\nforth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden. One\nevening, while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in\ngolden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was pausing\non horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had\nmet him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable\ndrainage, and was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard."

  "content": "Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more\nthan usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation. He\nwas doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in\nhimself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when\nthe sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and\nrevive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be\nheld with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a\nmeasure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are\npeculiar instruments of the divine intention. The memory has as many\nmoods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this\nmoment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of\nfar-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out\npreaching beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service\nof exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was\nhis own facility in expounding them. His brief reverie was interrupted\nby the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback, and was just\nshaking his bridle before starting, when he exclaimed—“Bless my heart! what’s this fellow in black coming along the lane?\nHe’s like one of those men one sees about after the races.”Mr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but made no\nreply. The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose\nappearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of\nblack and a crape hat-band. He was within three yards of the horseman\nnow, and they could see the flash of recognition in his face as he\nwhirled his stick upward, looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode, and\nat last exclaiming:—“By Jove, Nick, it’s you! I couldn’t be mistaken, though the\nfive-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both! How are you,\neh? you didn’t expect to see _me_ here. Come, shake us by the hand.” To\nsay that Mr. Raffles’ manner was rather excited would be only one mode\nof saying that it was evening. Caleb Garth could see that there was a\nmoment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode, but it ended in his\nputting out his hand coldly to Raffles and saying—“I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.”“Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,” said Raffles, adjusting\nhimself in a swaggering attitude. “I came to see him here before. I’m\nnot so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a\nletter—what you may call a providential thing. It’s uncommonly\nfortunate I met you, though; for I don’t care about seeing my stepson:\nhe’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone now. To tell the\ntruth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address,\nfor—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket."

  "content": "Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger\non the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose\nacquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker’s\nlife so unlike anything that was known of him in Middlemarch that they\nmust have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity. But Caleb was\npeculiar: certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were\nalmost absent from his mind; and one of these was curiosity about\npersonal affairs. Especially if there was anything discreditable to be\nfound out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and\nif he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were\ndiscovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit. He now spurred\nhis horse, and saying, “I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must\nbe getting home,” set off at a trot.“You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles continued.\n“That was not like the first-rate man of business you used to be. ‘The\nShrubs,’—they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut the\nLondon concern altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a rural\nmansion to invite me to. Lord, how many years it is ago! The old lady\nmust have been dead a pretty long while—gone to glory without the pain\nof knowing how poor her daughter was, eh? But, by Jove! you’re very\npale and pasty, Nick. Come, if you’re going home, I’ll walk by your\nside.”Mr. Bulstrode’s usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue.\nFive minutes before, the expanse of his life had been submerged in its\nevening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin\nseemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation\nan exercise of the closet, the bearing of his deeds a matter of private\nvision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the\ndivine purposes. And now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red\nfigure had risen before him in unmanageable solidity—an incorporate\npast which had not entered into his imagination of chastisements. But\nMr. Bulstrode’s thought was busy, and he was not a man to act or speak\nrashly.“I was going home,” he said, “but I can defer my ride a little. And you\ncan, if you please, rest here.”“Thank you,” said Raffles, making a grimace. “I don’t care now about\nseeing my stepson. I’d rather go home with you.”“Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he, is here no longer. I am\nmaster here now.”"

  "content": "Raffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before\nhe said, “Well then, I’ve no objection. I’ve had enough walking from\nthe coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider either. What I\nlike is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob. I was always a little heavy\nin the saddle. What a pleasant surprise it must be to you to see me,\nold fellow!” he continued, as they turned towards the house. “You don’t\nsay so; but you never took your luck heartily—you were always thinking\nof improving the occasion—you’d such a gift for improving your luck.”Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and swung his leg in a\nswaggering manner which was rather too much for his companion’s\njudicious patience.“If I remember rightly,” Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, “our\nacquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are\nnow assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you desire of me will be the\nmore readily rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did\nnot lie in our former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more\nthan twenty years of separation.”“You don’t like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick in my\nheart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my feelings\nhave ripened for you like fine old cognac. I hope you’ve got some in\nthe house now. Josh filled my flask well the last time.”Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac\nwas not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint\nof annoyance always served him as a fresh cue. But it was at least\nclear that further objection was useless, and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving\norders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest, had a\nresolute air of quietude.There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the\nservice of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode\nentertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former master.When there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the\nwainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said—"

  "content": "“Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly\nenjoy each other’s society. The wisest plan for both of us will\ntherefore be to part as soon as possible. Since you say that you wished\nto meet me, you probably considered that you had some business to\ntransact with me. But under the circumstances I will invite you to\nremain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early\nto-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can receive any\ncommunication you have to make to me.”“With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable place—a\nlittle dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night,\nwith this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the\nmorning. You’re a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed\nme a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between you and me\nthere was never anything but kindness.”Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and\nsneering in Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had\ndetermined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words\nupon him. But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the\ndifficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be\npermanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he should\nwish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could not be\nregarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might\nhave sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode’s subversion as an instrument\nof good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a\nchastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him very\ndifferent from the hours in which his struggle had been securely\nprivate, and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were\npardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds even when\ncommitted—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his\ndesire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the\ndivine scheme? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling\nand a rock of offence? For who would understand the work within him?\nWho would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him,\nconfound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of\nobloquy?"

  "content": "In his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode’s mind\nclad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman\nends. But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth’s\norbit and the solar system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is\nthe stable earth and the changing day. And now within all the automatic\nsuccession of theoretic phrases—distinct and inmost as the shiver and\nthe ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract pain, was\nthe forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and of his\nown wife. For the pain, as well as the public estimate of disgrace,\ndepends on the amount of previous profession. To men who only aim at\nescaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner’s dock is disgrace. But\nMr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.It was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he again\nreached Stone Court. The fine old place never looked more like a\ndelightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in\nflower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew,\nwere running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around\nhad a heart of peace within them. But everything was spoiled for the\nowner as he walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of\nMr. Raffles, with whom he was condemned to breakfast.It was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted\nparlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to\ntake at that early hour. The difference between his morning and evening\nself was not so great as his companion had imagined that it might be;\nthe delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger because his\nspirits were rather less highly pitched. Certainly his manners seemed\nmore disagreeable by the morning light.“As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,” said the banker, who\ncould hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without\neating it, “I shall be obliged if you will mention at once the ground\non which you wished to meet with me. I presume that you have a home\nelsewhere and will be glad to return to it.”“Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend,\nNick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we\nknew you meant to marry the old widow. Some said you had a handsome\nfamily likeness to old Nick, but that was your mother’s fault, calling\nyou Nicholas. Aren’t you glad to see me again? I expected an invite to\nstay with you at some pretty place. My own establishment is broken up\nnow my wife’s dead. I’ve no particular attachment to any spot; I would\nas soon settle hereabout as anywhere.”"

I considered that the strong\nwish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was\ntantamount to an engagement that you would remain there for life.”“Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a wish\nto stay. But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn’t suit me to\nstay any longer. And I’m not going again, Nick.” Here Mr. Raffles\nwinked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode.“Do you wish to be settled in any business? What is your calling now?”“Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can. I don’t\ncare about working any more. If I did anything it would be a little\ntravelling in the tobacco line—or something of that sort, which takes a\nman into agreeable company. But not without an independence to fall\nback upon. That’s what I want: I’m not so strong as I was, Nick, though\nI’ve got more color than you. I want an independence.”“That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a\ndistance,” said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much eagerness\nin his undertone.“That must be as it suits my convenience,” said Raffles coolly. “I see\nno reason why I shouldn’t make a few acquaintances hereabout. I’m not\nashamed of myself as company for anybody. I dropped my portmanteau at\nthe turnpike when I got down—change of linen—genuine—honor bright—more\nthan fronts and wristbands; and with this suit of mourning, straps and\neverything, I should do you credit among the nobs here.” Mr. Raffles\nhad pushed away his chair and looked down at himself, particularly at\nhis straps. His chief intention was to annoy Bulstrode, but he really\nthought that his appearance now would produce a good effect, and that\nhe was not only handsome and witty, but clad in a mourning style which\nimplied solid connections.“If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,” said Bulstrode,\nafter a moment’s pause, “you will expect to meet my wishes.”"

But\nyou’ve buried the old lady by this time, I suppose—it’s all one to her\nnow. And you’ve got your fortune out of that profitable business which\nhad such a blessing on it. You’ve taken to being a nob, buying land,\nbeing a country bashaw. Still in the Dissenting line, eh? Still godly?\nOr taken to the Church as more genteel?”This time Mr. Raffles’ slow wink and slight protrusion of his tongue\nwas worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was\nnot a nightmare, but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering\nnausea, and did not speak, but was considering diligently whether he\nshould not leave Raffles to do as he would, and simply defy him as a\nslanderer. The man would soon show himself disreputable enough to make\npeople disbelieve him. “But not when he tells any ugly-looking truth\nabout _you_,” said discerning consciousness. And again: it seemed no\nwrong to keep Raffles at a distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the\ndirect falsehood of denying true statements. It was one thing to look\nback on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax\ncustoms, and another to enter deliberately on the necessity of\nfalsehood.But since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of using time\nto the utmost.“I’ve not had such fine luck as you, by Jove! Things went confoundedly\nwith me in New York; those Yankees are cool hands, and a man of\ngentlemanly feelings has no chance with them. I married when I came\nback—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of me—but the trade\nwas restricted, as we say. She had been settled there a good many years\nby a friend; but there was a son too much in the case. Josh and I never\nhit it off. However, I made the most of the position, and I’ve always\ntaken my glass in good company. It’s been all on the square with me;\nI’m as open as the day. You won’t take it ill of me that I didn’t look\nyou up before. I’ve got a complaint that makes me a little dilatory. I\nthought you were trading and praying away in London still, and didn’t\nfind you there. But you see I was sent to you, Nick—perhaps for a\nblessing to both of us.”"

And if the cunning which calculates on the\nmeanest feelings in men could be called intellect, he had his share,\nfor under the blurting rallying tone with which he spoke to Bulstrode,\nthere was an evident selection of statements, as if they had been so\nmany moves at chess. Meanwhile Bulstrode had determined on his move,\nand he said, with gathered resolution—“You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible for a\nman to overreach himself in the effort to secure undue advantage.\nAlthough I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing to supply you\nwith a regular annuity—in quarterly payments—so long as you fulfil a\npromise to remain at a distance from this neighborhood. It is in your\npower to choose. If you insist on remaining here, even for a short\ntime, you will get nothing from me. I shall decline to know you.”“Ha, ha!” said Raffles, with an affected explosion, “that reminds me of\na droll dog of a thief who declined to know the constable.”“Your allusions are lost on me sir,” said Bulstrode, with white heat;\n“the law has no hold on me either through your agency or any other.”“You can’t understand a joke, my good fellow. I only meant that I\nshould never decline to know you. But let us be serious. Your quarterly\npayment won’t quite suit me. I like my freedom.”Here Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room,\nswinging his leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation. At last\nhe stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, “I’ll tell you what! Give us a\ncouple of hundreds—come, that’s modest—and I’ll go away—honor\nbright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall not give up my\nliberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go where I like. Perhaps\nit may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a friend; perhaps not.\nHave you the money with you?”“No, I have one hundred,” said Bulstrode, feeling the immediate\nriddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future\nuncertainties. “I will forward you the other if you will mention an\naddress.”“No, I’ll wait here till you bring it,” said Raffles. “I’ll take a\nstroll and have a snack, and you’ll be back by that time.”"

At that moment he snatched at a temporary\nrepose to be won on any terms. He was rising to do what Raffles\nsuggested, when the latter said, lifting up his finger as if with a\nsudden recollection—“I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn’t tell you;\nI’d a tender conscience about that pretty young woman. I didn’t find\nher, but I found out her husband’s name, and I made a note of it. But\nhang it, I lost my pocketbook. However, if I heard it, I should know it\nagain. I’ve got my faculties as if I was in my prime, but names wear\nout, by Jove! Sometimes I’m no better than a confounded tax-paper\nbefore the names are filled in. However, if I hear of her and her\nfamily, you shall know, Nick. You’d like to do something for her, now\nshe’s your step-daughter.”“Doubtless,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with the usual steady look of his\nlight-gray eyes; “though that might reduce my power of assisting you.”As he walked out of the room, Raffles winked slowly at his back, and\nthen turned towards the window to watch the banker riding\naway—virtually at his command. His lips first curled with a smile and\nthen opened with a short triumphant laugh.“But what the deuce was the name?” he presently said, half aloud,\nscratching his head, and wrinkling his brows horizontally. He had not\nreally cared or thought about this point of forgetfulness until it\noccurred to him in his invention of annoyances for Bulstrode.“It began with L; it was almost all l’s I fancy,” he went on, with a\nsense that he was getting hold of the slippery name. But the hold was\ntoo slight, and he soon got tired of this mental chase; for few men\nwere more impatient of private occupation or more in need of making\nthemselves continually heard than Mr. Raffles. He preferred using his\ntime in pleasant conversation with the bailiff and the housekeeper,\nfrom whom he gathered as much as he wanted to know about Mr.\nBulstrode’s position in Middlemarch."

Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down the\nname, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of not\nbeing at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. He was not going to\ntell Bulstrode: there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind like\nthat of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret.He was satisfied with his present success, and by three o’clock that\nday he had taken up his portmanteau at the turnpike and mounted the\ncoach, relieving Mr. Bulstrode’s eyes of an ugly black spot on the\nlandscape at Stone Court, but not relieving him of the dread that the\nblack spot might reappear and become inseparable even from the vision\nof his hearth.BOOK VI.\nTHE WIDOW AND THE WIFE.CHAPTER LIV.“Negli occhi porta la mia donna Amore;\nPer che si fa gentil ciò ch’ella mira:\nOv’ella passa, ogni uom ver lei si gira,\nE cui saluta fa tremar lo core.Sicchè, bassando il viso, tutto smore,\nE d’ogni suo difetto allor sospira:\nFuggon dinanzi a lei Superbia ed Ira:\nAiutatemi, donne, a farle onore.Ogni dolcezza, ogni pensiero umile\nNasce nel core a chi parlar la sente;\nOnd’è beato chi prima la vide.\nQuel ch’ella par quand’ un poco sorride,\nNon si può dicer, nè tener a mente,\nSi è nuovo miracolo gentile.”\n—DANTE: _La Vita Nuova_.By that delightful morning when the hay-ricks at Stone Court were\nscenting the air quite impartially, as if Mr. Raffles had been a guest\nworthy of finest incense, Dorothea had again taken up her abode at\nLowick Manor. After three months Freshitt had become rather oppressive:\nto sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking rapturously at Celia’s\nbaby would not do for many hours in the day, and to remain in that\nmomentous babe’s presence with persistent disregard was a course that\ncould not have been tolerated in a childless sister. Dorothea would\nhave been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had\nbeen need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that labor; but to an\naunt who does not recognize her infant nephew as Bouddha, and has\nnothing to do for him but to admire, his behavior is apt to appear\nmonotonous, and the interest of watching him exhaustible. This\npossibility was quite hidden from Celia, who felt that Dorothea’s\nchildless widowhood fell in quite prettily with the birth of little\nArthur (baby was named after Mr. Brooke)."

Could it,\nJames?“Not if it had been like Casaubon,” said Sir James, conscious of some\nindirectness in his answer, and of holding a strictly private opinion\nas to the perfections of his first-born.“No! just imagine! Really it was a mercy,” said Celia; “and I think it\nis very nice for Dodo to be a widow. She can be just as fond of our\nbaby as if it were her own, and she can have as many notions of her own\nas she likes.”“It is a pity she was not a queen,” said the devout Sir James.“But what should we have been then? We must have been something else,”\nsaid Celia, objecting to so laborious a flight of imagination. “I like\nher better as she is.”Hence, when she found that Dorothea was making arrangements for her\nfinal departure to Lowick, Celia raised her eyebrows with\ndisappointment, and in her quiet unemphatic way shot a needle-arrow of\nsarcasm.“What will you do at Lowick, Dodo? You say yourself there is nothing to\nbe done there: everybody is so clean and well off, it makes you quite\nmelancholy. And here you have been so happy going all about Tipton with\nMr. Garth into the worst backyards. And now uncle is abroad, you and\nMr. Garth can have it all your own way; and I am sure James does\neverything you tell him.”“I shall often come here, and I shall see how baby grows all the\nbetter,” said Dorothea.“But you will never see him washed,” said Celia; “and that is quite the\nbest part of the day.” She was almost pouting: it did seem to her very\nhard in Dodo to go away from the baby when she might stay.“Dear Kitty, I will come and stay all night on purpose,” said Dorothea;\n“but I want to be alone now, and in my own home. I wish to know the\nFarebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is\nto be done in Middlemarch.”"

She had a great yearning to be at Lowick, and was\nsimply determined to go, not feeling bound to tell all her reasons. But\nevery one around her disapproved. Sir James was much pained, and\noffered that they should all migrate to Cheltenham for a few months\nwith the sacred ark, otherwise called a cradle: at that period a man\ncould hardly know what to propose if Cheltenham were rejected.The Dowager Lady Chettam, just returned from a visit to her daughter in\ntown, wished, at least, that Mrs. Vigo should be written to, and\ninvited to accept the office of companion to Mrs. Casaubon: it was not\ncredible that Dorothea as a young widow would think of living alone in\nthe house at Lowick. Mrs. Vigo had been reader and secretary to royal\npersonages, and in point of knowledge and sentiments even Dorothea\ncould have nothing to object to her.Mrs. Cadwallader said, privately, “You will certainly go mad in that\nhouse alone, my dear. You will see visions. We have all got to exert\nourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as\nother people call them by. To be sure, for younger sons and women who\nhave no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad: they are taken care\nof then. But you must not run into that. I dare say you are a little\nbored here with our good dowager; but think what a bore you might\nbecome yourself to your fellow-creatures if you were always playing\ntragedy queen and taking things sublimely. Sitting alone in that\nlibrary at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must\nget a few people round you who wouldn’t believe you if you told them.\nThat is a good lowering medicine.”“I never called everything by the same name that all the people about\nme did,” said Dorothea, stoutly.“But I suppose you have found out your mistake, my dear,” said Mrs.\nCadwallader, “and that is a proof of sanity.”Dorothea was aware of the sting, but it did not hurt her. “No,” she\nsaid, “I still think that the greater part of the world is mistaken\nabout many things. Surely one may be sane and yet think so, since the\ngreater part of the world has often had to come round from its\nopinion.”"

Of course\nthe Chettams would not wish it. But I see clearly a husband is the best\nthing to keep her in order. If we were not so poor I would invite Lord\nTriton. He will be marquis some day, and there is no denying that she\nwould make a good marchioness: she looks handsomer than ever in her\nmourning.”“My dear Elinor, do let the poor woman alone. Such contrivances are of\nno use,” said the easy Rector.“No use? How are matches made, except by bringing men and women\ntogether? And it is a shame that her uncle should have run away and\nshut up the Grange just now. There ought to be plenty of eligible\nmatches invited to Freshitt and the Grange. Lord Triton is precisely\nthe man: full of plans for making the people happy in a soft-headed\nsort of way. That would just suit Mrs. Casaubon.”“Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for herself, Elinor.”“That is the nonsense you wise men talk! How can she choose if she has\nno variety to choose from? A woman’s choice usually means taking the\nonly man she can get. Mark my words, Humphrey. If her friends don’t\nexert themselves, there will be a worse business than the Casaubon\nbusiness yet.”“For heaven’s sake don’t touch on that topic, Elinor! It is a very sore\npoint with Sir James. He would be deeply offended if you entered on it\nto him unnecessarily.”“I have never entered on it,” said Mrs Cadwallader, opening her hands.\n“Celia told me all about the will at the beginning, without any asking\nof mine.”“Yes, yes; but they want the thing hushed up, and I understand that the\nyoung fellow is going out of the neighborhood.”Mrs. Cadwallader said nothing, but gave her husband three significant\nnods, with a very sarcastic expression in her dark eyes."

  "content": "Dorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance and persuasion. So\nby the end of June the shutters were all opened at Lowick Manor, and\nthe morning gazed calmly into the library, shining on the rows of\nnote-books as it shines on the weary waste planted with huge stones,\nthe mute memorial of a forgotten faith; and the evening laden with\nroses entered silently into the blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose\noftenest to sit. At first she walked into every room, questioning the\neighteen months of her married life, and carrying on her thoughts as if\nthey were a speech to be heard by her husband. Then, she lingered in\nthe library and could not be at rest till she had carefully ranged all\nthe note-books as she imagined that he would wish to see them, in\norderly sequence. The pity which had been the restraining compelling\nmotive in her life with him still clung about his image, even while she\nremonstrated with him in indignant thought and told him that he was\nunjust. One little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at as\nsuperstitious. The Synoptical Tabulation for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,\nshe carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within the envelope, “I\ncould not use it. Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul to\nyours, by working hopelessly at what I have no belief in—Dorothea?”\nThen she deposited the paper in her own desk.That silent colloquy was perhaps only the more earnest because\nunderneath and through it all there was always the deep longing which\nhad really determined her to come to Lowick. The longing was to see\nWill Ladislaw. She did not know any good that could come of their\nmeeting: she was helpless; her hands had been tied from making up to\nhim for any unfairness in his lot. But her soul thirsted to see him.\nHow could it be otherwise? If a princess in the days of enchantment had\nseen a four-footed creature from among those which live in herds come\nto her once and again with a human gaze which rested upon her with\nchoice and beseeching, what would she think of in her journeying, what\nwould she look for when the herds passed her? Surely for the gaze which\nhad found her, and which she would know again. Life would be no better\nthan candle-light tinsel and daylight rubbish if our spirits were not\ntouched by what has been, to issues of longing and constancy. It was\ntrue that Dorothea wanted to know the Farebrothers better, and\nespecially to talk to the new rector, but also true that remembering\nwhat Lydgate had told her about Will Ladislaw and little Miss Noble,\nshe counted on Will’s coming to Lowick to see the Farebrother family.\nThe very first Sunday, _before_ she entered the church, she saw him as\nshe had seen him the last time she was there, alone in the clergyman’s\npew; but _when_ she entered his figure was gone.In the week-days when she went to see the ladies at the Rectory, she\nlistened in vain for some word that they might let fall about Will; but\nit seemed to her that Mrs. Farebrother talked of every one else in the\nneighborhood and out of it.“Probably some of Mr. Farebrother’s Middlemarch hearers may follow him\nto Lowick sometimes. Do you not think so?” said Dorothea, rather\ndespising herself for having a secret motive in asking the question."

  "content": "“If they are wise they will, Mrs. Casaubon,” said the old lady. “I see\nthat you set a right value on my son’s preaching. His grandfather on my\nside was an excellent clergyman, but his father was in the law:—most\nexemplary and honest nevertheless, which is a reason for our never\nbeing rich. They say Fortune is a woman and capricious. But sometimes\nshe is a good woman and gives to those who merit, which has been the\ncase with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who have given a living to my son.”Mrs. Farebrother recurred to her knitting with a dignified satisfaction\nin her neat little effort at oratory, but this was not what Dorothea\nwanted to hear. Poor thing! she did not even know whether Will Ladislaw\nwas still at Middlemarch, and there was no one whom she dared to ask,\nunless it were Lydgate. But just now she could not see Lydgate without\nsending for him or going to seek him. Perhaps Will Ladislaw, having\nheard of that strange ban against him left by Mr. Casaubon, had felt it\nbetter that he and she should not meet again, and perhaps she was wrong\nto wish for a meeting that others might find many good reasons against.\nStill “I do wish it” came at the end of those wise reflections as\nnaturally as a sob after holding the breath. And the meeting did\nhappen, but in a formal way quite unexpected by her.One morning, about eleven, Dorothea was seated in her boudoir with a\nmap of the land attached to the manor and other papers before her,\nwhich were to help her in making an exact statement for herself of her\nincome and affairs. She had not yet applied herself to her work, but\nwas seated with her hands folded on her lap, looking out along the\navenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf was at rest in the\nsunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent\nthe prospect of her life, full of motiveless ease—motiveless, if her\nown energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow’s\ncap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown\nstanding up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of\ncrape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made her face look all the\nyounger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of\nher eyes.Her reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Mr. Ladislaw\nwas below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were not too early.“I will see him,” said Dorothea, rising immediately. “Let him be shown\ninto the drawing-room.”"
