  "content": "After all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed\nrelieving with bread and cheese and ale, and when he was seated alone\nwith these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he suddenly slapped his\nknee, and exclaimed, “Ladislaw!” That action of memory which he had\ntried to set going, and had abandoned in despair, had suddenly\ncompleted itself without conscious effort—a common experience,\nagreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of no\nvalue. Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down the\nname, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of not\nbeing at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. He was not going to\ntell Bulstrode: there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind like\nthat of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret.He was satisfied with his present success, and by three o’clock that\nday he had taken up his portmanteau at the turnpike and mounted the\ncoach, relieving Mr. Bulstrode’s eyes of an ugly black spot on the\nlandscape at Stone Court, but not relieving him of the dread that the\nblack spot might reappear and become inseparable even from the vision\nof his hearth.BOOK VI.\nTHE WIDOW AND THE WIFE.CHAPTER LIV.“Negli occhi porta la mia donna Amore;\nPer che si fa gentil ciò ch’ella mira:\nOv’ella passa, ogni uom ver lei si gira,\nE cui saluta fa tremar lo core.Sicchè, bassando il viso, tutto smore,\nE d’ogni suo difetto allor sospira:\nFuggon dinanzi a lei Superbia ed Ira:\nAiutatemi, donne, a farle onore.Ogni dolcezza, ogni pensiero umile\nNasce nel core a chi parlar la sente;\nOnd’è beato chi prima la vide.\nQuel ch’ella par quand’ un poco sorride,\nNon si può dicer, nè tener a mente,\nSi è nuovo miracolo gentile.”\n—DANTE: _La Vita Nuova_.By that delightful morning when the hay-ricks at Stone Court were\nscenting the air quite impartially, as if Mr. Raffles had been a guest\nworthy of finest incense, Dorothea had again taken up her abode at\nLowick Manor. After three months Freshitt had become rather oppressive:\nto sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking rapturously at Celia’s\nbaby would not do for many hours in the day, and to remain in that\nmomentous babe’s presence with persistent disregard was a course that\ncould not have been tolerated in a childless sister. Dorothea would\nhave been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had\nbeen need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that labor; but to an\naunt who does not recognize her infant nephew as Bouddha, and has\nnothing to do for him but to admire, his behavior is apt to appear\nmonotonous, and the interest of watching him exhaustible. This\npossibility was quite hidden from Celia, who felt that Dorothea’s\nchildless widowhood fell in quite prettily with the birth of little\nArthur (baby was named after Mr. Brooke)."

Could it,\nJames?“Not if it had been like Casaubon,” said Sir James, conscious of some\nindirectness in his answer, and of holding a strictly private opinion\nas to the perfections of his first-born.“No! just imagine! Really it was a mercy,” said Celia; “and I think it\nis very nice for Dodo to be a widow. She can be just as fond of our\nbaby as if it were her own, and she can have as many notions of her own\nas she likes.”“It is a pity she was not a queen,” said the devout Sir James.“But what should we have been then? We must have been something else,”\nsaid Celia, objecting to so laborious a flight of imagination. “I like\nher better as she is.”Hence, when she found that Dorothea was making arrangements for her\nfinal departure to Lowick, Celia raised her eyebrows with\ndisappointment, and in her quiet unemphatic way shot a needle-arrow of\nsarcasm.“What will you do at Lowick, Dodo? You say yourself there is nothing to\nbe done there: everybody is so clean and well off, it makes you quite\nmelancholy. And here you have been so happy going all about Tipton with\nMr. Garth into the worst backyards. And now uncle is abroad, you and\nMr. Garth can have it all your own way; and I am sure James does\neverything you tell him.”“I shall often come here, and I shall see how baby grows all the\nbetter,” said Dorothea.“But you will never see him washed,” said Celia; “and that is quite the\nbest part of the day.” She was almost pouting: it did seem to her very\nhard in Dodo to go away from the baby when she might stay.“Dear Kitty, I will come and stay all night on purpose,” said Dorothea;\n“but I want to be alone now, and in my own home. I wish to know the\nFarebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is\nto be done in Middlemarch.”"

  "content": "Dorothea’s native strength of will was no longer all converted into\nresolute submission. She had a great yearning to be at Lowick, and was\nsimply determined to go, not feeling bound to tell all her reasons. But\nevery one around her disapproved. Sir James was much pained, and\noffered that they should all migrate to Cheltenham for a few months\nwith the sacred ark, otherwise called a cradle: at that period a man\ncould hardly know what to propose if Cheltenham were rejected.The Dowager Lady Chettam, just returned from a visit to her daughter in\ntown, wished, at least, that Mrs. Vigo should be written to, and\ninvited to accept the office of companion to Mrs. Casaubon: it was not\ncredible that Dorothea as a young widow would think of living alone in\nthe house at Lowick. Mrs. Vigo had been reader and secretary to royal\npersonages, and in point of knowledge and sentiments even Dorothea\ncould have nothing to object to her.Mrs. Cadwallader said, privately, “You will certainly go mad in that\nhouse alone, my dear. You will see visions. We have all got to exert\nourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as\nother people call them by. To be sure, for younger sons and women who\nhave no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad: they are taken care\nof then. But you must not run into that. I dare say you are a little\nbored here with our good dowager; but think what a bore you might\nbecome yourself to your fellow-creatures if you were always playing\ntragedy queen and taking things sublimely. Sitting alone in that\nlibrary at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must\nget a few people round you who wouldn’t believe you if you told them.\nThat is a good lowering medicine.”“I never called everything by the same name that all the people about\nme did,” said Dorothea, stoutly.“But I suppose you have found out your mistake, my dear,” said Mrs.\nCadwallader, “and that is a proof of sanity.”Dorothea was aware of the sting, but it did not hurt her. “No,” she\nsaid, “I still think that the greater part of the world is mistaken\nabout many things. Surely one may be sane and yet think so, since the\ngreater part of the world has often had to come round from its\nopinion.”"

  "content": "Mrs. Cadwallader said no more on that point to Dorothea, but to her\nhusband she remarked, “It will be well for her to marry again as soon\nas it is proper, if one could get her among the right people. Of course\nthe Chettams would not wish it. But I see clearly a husband is the best\nthing to keep her in order. If we were not so poor I would invite Lord\nTriton. He will be marquis some day, and there is no denying that she\nwould make a good marchioness: she looks handsomer than ever in her\nmourning.”“My dear Elinor, do let the poor woman alone. Such contrivances are of\nno use,” said the easy Rector.“No use? How are matches made, except by bringing men and women\ntogether? And it is a shame that her uncle should have run away and\nshut up the Grange just now. There ought to be plenty of eligible\nmatches invited to Freshitt and the Grange. Lord Triton is precisely\nthe man: full of plans for making the people happy in a soft-headed\nsort of way. That would just suit Mrs. Casaubon.”“Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for herself, Elinor.”“That is the nonsense you wise men talk! How can she choose if she has\nno variety to choose from? A woman’s choice usually means taking the\nonly man she can get. Mark my words, Humphrey. If her friends don’t\nexert themselves, there will be a worse business than the Casaubon\nbusiness yet.”“For heaven’s sake don’t touch on that topic, Elinor! It is a very sore\npoint with Sir James. He would be deeply offended if you entered on it\nto him unnecessarily.”“I have never entered on it,” said Mrs Cadwallader, opening her hands.\n“Celia told me all about the will at the beginning, without any asking\nof mine.”“Yes, yes; but they want the thing hushed up, and I understand that the\nyoung fellow is going out of the neighborhood.”Mrs. Cadwallader said nothing, but gave her husband three significant\nnods, with a very sarcastic expression in her dark eyes."

  "content": "Dorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance and persuasion. So\nby the end of June the shutters were all opened at Lowick Manor, and\nthe morning gazed calmly into the library, shining on the rows of\nnote-books as it shines on the weary waste planted with huge stones,\nthe mute memorial of a forgotten faith; and the evening laden with\nroses entered silently into the blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose\noftenest to sit. At first she walked into every room, questioning the\neighteen months of her married life, and carrying on her thoughts as if\nthey were a speech to be heard by her husband. Then, she lingered in\nthe library and could not be at rest till she had carefully ranged all\nthe note-books as she imagined that he would wish to see them, in\norderly sequence. The pity which had been the restraining compelling\nmotive in her life with him still clung about his image, even while she\nremonstrated with him in indignant thought and told him that he was\nunjust. One little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at as\nsuperstitious. The Synoptical Tabulation for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,\nshe carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within the envelope, “I\ncould not use it. Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul to\nyours, by working hopelessly at what I have no belief in—Dorothea?”\nThen she deposited the paper in her own desk.That silent colloquy was perhaps only the more earnest because\nunderneath and through it all there was always the deep longing which\nhad really determined her to come to Lowick. The longing was to see\nWill Ladislaw. She did not know any good that could come of their\nmeeting: she was helpless; her hands had been tied from making up to\nhim for any unfairness in his lot. But her soul thirsted to see him.\nHow could it be otherwise? If a princess in the days of enchantment had\nseen a four-footed creature from among those which live in herds come\nto her once and again with a human gaze which rested upon her with\nchoice and beseeching, what would she think of in her journeying, what\nwould she look for when the herds passed her? Surely for the gaze which\nhad found her, and which she would know again. Life would be no better\nthan candle-light tinsel and daylight rubbish if our spirits were not\ntouched by what has been, to issues of longing and constancy. It was\ntrue that Dorothea wanted to know the Farebrothers better, and\nespecially to talk to the new rector, but also true that remembering\nwhat Lydgate had told her about Will Ladislaw and little Miss Noble,\nshe counted on Will’s coming to Lowick to see the Farebrother family.\nThe very first Sunday, _before_ she entered the church, she saw him as\nshe had seen him the last time she was there, alone in the clergyman’s\npew; but _when_ she entered his figure was gone.In the week-days when she went to see the ladies at the Rectory, she\nlistened in vain for some word that they might let fall about Will; but\nit seemed to her that Mrs. Farebrother talked of every one else in the\nneighborhood and out of it.“Probably some of Mr. Farebrother’s Middlemarch hearers may follow him\nto Lowick sometimes. Do you not think so?” said Dorothea, rather\ndespising herself for having a secret motive in asking the question."

His grandfather on my\nside was an excellent clergyman, but his father was in the law:—most\nexemplary and honest nevertheless, which is a reason for our never\nbeing rich. They say Fortune is a woman and capricious. But sometimes\nshe is a good woman and gives to those who merit, which has been the\ncase with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who have given a living to my son.”Mrs. Farebrother recurred to her knitting with a dignified satisfaction\nin her neat little effort at oratory, but this was not what Dorothea\nwanted to hear. Poor thing! she did not even know whether Will Ladislaw\nwas still at Middlemarch, and there was no one whom she dared to ask,\nunless it were Lydgate. But just now she could not see Lydgate without\nsending for him or going to seek him. Perhaps Will Ladislaw, having\nheard of that strange ban against him left by Mr. Casaubon, had felt it\nbetter that he and she should not meet again, and perhaps she was wrong\nto wish for a meeting that others might find many good reasons against.\nStill “I do wish it” came at the end of those wise reflections as\nnaturally as a sob after holding the breath. And the meeting did\nhappen, but in a formal way quite unexpected by her.One morning, about eleven, Dorothea was seated in her boudoir with a\nmap of the land attached to the manor and other papers before her,\nwhich were to help her in making an exact statement for herself of her\nincome and affairs. She had not yet applied herself to her work, but\nwas seated with her hands folded on her lap, looking out along the\navenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf was at rest in the\nsunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent\nthe prospect of her life, full of motiveless ease—motiveless, if her\nown energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow’s\ncap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown\nstanding up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of\ncrape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made her face look all the\nyounger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of\nher eyes.Her reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Mr. Ladislaw\nwas below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were not too early.“I will see him,” said Dorothea, rising immediately. “Let him be shown\ninto the drawing-room.”"

  "content": "The drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to her—the one\nleast associated with the trials of her married life: the damask\nmatched the wood-work, which was all white and gold; there were two\ntall mirrors and tables with nothing on them—in brief, it was a room\nwhere you had no reason for sitting in one place rather than in\nanother. It was below the boudoir, and had also a bow-window looking\nout on the avenue. But when Pratt showed Will Ladislaw into it the\nwindow was open; and a winged visitor, buzzing in and out now and then\nwithout minding the furniture, made the room look less formal and\nuninhabited.“Glad to see you here again, sir,” said Pratt, lingering to adjust a\nblind.“I am only come to say good-by, Pratt,” said Will, who wished even the\nbutler to know that he was too proud to hang about Mrs. Casaubon now\nshe was a rich widow.“Very sorry to hear it, sir,” said Pratt, retiring. Of course, as a\nservant who was to be told nothing, he knew the fact of which Ladislaw\nwas still ignorant, and had drawn his inferences; indeed, had not\ndiffered from his betrothed Tantripp when she said, “Your master was as\njealous as a fiend—and no reason. Madam would look higher than Mr.\nLadislaw, else I don’t know her. Mrs. Cadwallader’s maid says there’s a\nlord coming who is to marry her when the mourning’s over.”There were not many moments for Will to walk about with his hat in his\nhand before Dorothea entered. The meeting was very different from that\nfirst meeting in Rome when Will had been embarrassed and Dorothea calm.\nThis time he felt miserable but determined, while she was in a state of\nagitation which could not be hidden. Just outside the door she had felt\nthat this longed-for meeting was after all too difficult, and when she\nsaw Will advancing towards her, the deep blush which was rare in her\ncame with painful suddenness. Neither of them knew how it was, but\nneither of them spoke. She gave her hand for a moment, and then they\nwent to sit down near the window, she on one settee and he on another\nopposite. Will was peculiarly uneasy: it seemed to him not like\nDorothea that the mere fact of her being a widow should cause such a\nchange in her manner of receiving him; and he knew of no other\ncondition which could have affected their previous relation to each\nother—except that, as his imagination at once told him, her friends\nmight have been poisoning her mind with their suspicions of him.“I hope I have not presumed too much in calling,” said Will; “I could\nnot bear to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life without seeing\nyou to say good-by.”"

I should have thought it unkind if you had not\nwished to see me,” said Dorothea, her habit of speaking with perfect\ngenuineness asserting itself through all her uncertainty and agitation.\n“Are you going away immediately?”“Very soon, I think. I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a\nbarrister, since, they say, that is the preparation for all public\nbusiness. There will be a great deal of political work to be done\nby-and-by, and I mean to try and do some of it. Other men have managed\nto win an honorable position for themselves without family or money.”“And that will make it all the more honorable,” said Dorothea,\nardently. “Besides, you have so many talents. I have heard from my\nuncle how well you speak in public, so that every one is sorry when you\nleave off, and how clearly you can explain things. And you care that\njustice should be done to every one. I am so glad. When we were in\nRome, I thought you only cared for poetry and art, and the things that\nadorn life for us who are well off. But now I know you think about the\nrest of the world.”While she was speaking Dorothea had lost her personal embarrassment,\nand had become like her former self. She looked at Will with a direct\nglance, full of delighted confidence.“You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here\nagain till I have made myself of some mark in the world?” said Will,\ntrying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get\nan expression of strong feeling from Dorothea."

She had turned\nher head and was looking out of the window on the rose-bushes, which\nseemed to have in them the summers of all the years when Will would be\naway. This was not judicious behavior. But Dorothea never thought of\nstudying her manners: she thought only of bowing to a sad necessity\nwhich divided her from Will. Those first words of his about his\nintentions had seemed to make everything clear to her: he knew, she\nsupposed, all about Mr. Casaubon’s final conduct in relation to him,\nand it had come to him with the same sort of shock as to herself. He\nhad never felt more than friendship for her—had never had anything in\nhis mind to justify what she felt to be her husband’s outrage on the\nfeelings of both: and that friendship he still felt. Something which\nmay be called an inward silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she\nsaid with a pure voice, just trembling in the last words as if only\nfrom its liquid flexibility—“Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very happy\nwhen I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have\npatience. It will perhaps be a long while.”Will never quite knew how it was that he saved himself from falling\ndown at her feet, when the “long while” came forth with its gentle\ntremor. He used to say that the horrible hue and surface of her crape\ndress was most likely the sufficient controlling force. He sat still,\nhowever, and only said—“I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about me.”“No,” said Dorothea, “I shall never forget you. I have never forgotten\nany one whom I once knew. My life has never been crowded, and seems not\nlikely to be so. And I have a great deal of space for memory at Lowick,\nhaven’t I?” She smiled.“Good God!” Will burst out passionately, rising, with his hat still in\nhis hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he suddenly turned\nand leaned his back against it. The blood had mounted to his face and\nneck, and he looked almost angry. It had seemed to him as if they were\nlike two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other’s presence,\nwhile their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning. But\nthere was no help for it. It should never be true of him that in this\nmeeting to which he had come with bitter resolution he had ended by a\nconfession which might be interpreted into asking for her fortune.\nMoreover, it was actually true that he was fearful of the effect which\nsuch confessions might have on Dorothea herself."

But all the while there\nwas a current of thought in her about his probable want of money, and\nthe impossibility of her helping him. If her uncle had been at home,\nsomething might have been done through him! It was this preoccupation\nwith the hardship of Will’s wanting money, while she had what ought to\nhave been his share, which led her to say, seeing that he remained\nsilent and looked away from her—“I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which hangs\nup-stairs—I mean that beautiful miniature of your grandmother. I think\nit is not right for me to keep it, if you would wish to have it. It is\nwonderfully like you.”“You are very good,” said Will, irritably. “No; I don’t mind about it.\nIt is not very consoling to have one’s own likeness. It would be more\nconsoling if others wanted to have it.”“I thought you would like to cherish her memory—I thought—” Dorothea\nbroke off an instant, her imagination suddenly warning her away from\nAunt Julia’s history—“you would surely like to have the miniature as a\nfamily memorial.”“Why should I have that, when I have nothing else! A man with only a\nportmanteau for his stowage must keep his memorials in his head.”Will spoke at random: he was merely venting his petulance; it was a\nlittle too exasperating to have his grandmother’s portrait offered him\nat that moment. But to Dorothea’s feeling his words had a peculiar\nsting. She rose and said with a touch of indignation as well as\nhauteur—“You are much the happier of us two, Mr. Ladislaw, to have nothing.”Will was startled. Whatever the words might be, the tone seemed like a\ndismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a little way\ntowards her. Their eyes met, but with a strange questioning gravity.\nSomething was keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to\nconjecture what was in the other. Will had really never thought of\nhimself as having a claim of inheritance on the property which was held\nby Dorothea, and would have required a narrative to make him understand\nher present feeling.“I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now,” he said. “But\npoverty may be as bad as leprosy, if it divides us from what we most\ncare for.”The words cut Dorothea to the heart, and made her relent.

He was\ngoing away into the distance of unknown years, and if ever he came back\nhe would be another man. The actual state of his mind—his proud resolve\nto give the lie beforehand to any suspicion that he would play the\nneedy adventurer seeking a rich woman—lay quite out of her imagination,\nand she had interpreted all his behavior easily enough by her\nsupposition that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil seemed to him, as it did to\nher, a gross and cruel interdict on any active friendship between them.\nTheir young delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one\nelse would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of\nthe past. For this very reason she dwelt on it without inward check.\nThat unique happiness too was dead, and in its shadowed silent chamber\nshe might vent the passionate grief which she herself wondered at.

But this\nwas not until some episodes with baby were over, and had left her mind\nat leisure. She had seated herself and taken up a fan for some time\nbefore she said, in her quiet guttural—“Dear Dodo, do throw off that cap. I am sure your dress must make you\nfeel ill.”“I am so used to the cap—it has become a sort of shell,” said Dorothea,\nsmiling. “I feel rather bare and exposed when it is off.”“I must see you without it; it makes us all warm,” said Celia, throwing\ndown her fan, and going to Dorothea. It was a pretty picture to see\nthis little lady in white muslin unfastening the widow’s cap from her\nmore majestic sister, and tossing it on to a chair. Just as the coils\nand braids of dark-brown hair had been set free, Sir James entered the\nroom. He looked at the released head, and said, “Ah!” in a tone of\nsatisfaction.“It was I who did it, James,” said Celia. “Dodo need not make such a\nslavery of her mourning; she need not wear that cap any more among her\nfriends.”“My dear Celia,” said Lady Chettam, “a widow must wear her mourning at\nleast a year.”“Not if she marries again before the end of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,\nwho had some pleasure in startling her good friend the Dowager. Sir\nJames was annoyed, and leaned forward to play with Celia’s Maltese dog."

  "content": "“That is very rare, I hope,” said Lady Chettam, in a tone intended to\nguard against such events. “No friend of ours ever committed herself in\nthat way except Mrs. Beevor, and it was very painful to Lord Grinsell\nwhen she did so. Her first husband was objectionable, which made it the\ngreater wonder. And severely she was punished for it. They said Captain\nBeevor dragged her about by the hair, and held up loaded pistols at\nher.”“Oh, if she took the wrong man!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who was in a\ndecidedly wicked mood. “Marriage is always bad then, first or second.\nPriority is a poor recommendation in a husband if he has got no other.\nI would rather have a good second husband than an indifferent first.”“My dear, your clever tongue runs away with you,” said Lady Chettam. “I\nam sure you would be the last woman to marry again prematurely, if our\ndear Rector were taken away.”“Oh, I make no vows; it might be a necessary economy. It is lawful to\nmarry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of\nChristians. Of course if a woman accepts the wrong man, she must take\nthe consequences, and one who does it twice over deserves her fate. But\nif she can marry blood, beauty, and bravery—the sooner the better.”“I think the subject of our conversation is very ill-chosen,” said Sir\nJames, with a look of disgust. “Suppose we change it.”“Not on my account, Sir James,” said Dorothea, determined not to lose\nthe opportunity of freeing herself from certain oblique references to\nexcellent matches. “If you are speaking on my behalf, I can assure you\nthat no question can be more indifferent and impersonal to me than\nsecond marriage. It is no more to me than if you talked of women going\nfox-hunting: whether it is admirable in them or not, I shall not follow\nthem. Pray let Mrs. Cadwallader amuse herself on that subject as much\nas on any other.”“My dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Lady Chettam, in her stateliest way, “you\ndo not, I hope, think there was any allusion to you in my mentioning\nMrs. Beevor. It was only an instance that occurred to me. She was\nstep-daughter to Lord Grinsell: he married Mrs. Teveroy for his second\nwife. There could be no possible allusion to you.”“Oh no,” said Celia. “Nobody chose the subject; it all came out of\nDodo’s cap. Mrs. Cadwallader only said what was quite true. A woman\ncould not be married in a widow’s cap, James.”"

  "content": "“Hush, my dear!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “I will not offend again. I\nwill not even refer to Dido or Zenobia. Only what are we to talk about?\nI, for my part, object to the discussion of Human Nature, because that\nis the nature of rectors’ wives.”Later in the evening, after Mrs. Cadwallader was gone, Celia said\nprivately to Dorothea, “Really, Dodo, taking your cap off made you like\nyourself again in more ways than one. You spoke up just as you used to\ndo, when anything was said to displease you. But I could hardly make\nout whether it was James that you thought wrong, or Mrs. Cadwallader.”“Neither,” said Dorothea. “James spoke out of delicacy to me, but he\nwas mistaken in supposing that I minded what Mrs. Cadwallader said. I\nshould only mind if there were a law obliging me to take any piece of\nblood and beauty that she or anybody else recommended.”“But you know, Dodo, if you ever did marry, it would be all the better\nto have blood and beauty,” said Celia, reflecting that Mr. Casaubon had\nnot been richly endowed with those gifts, and that it would be well to\ncaution Dorothea in time.“Don’t be anxious, Kitty; I have quite other thoughts about my life. I\nshall never marry again,” said Dorothea, touching her sister’s chin,\nand looking at her with indulgent affection. Celia was nursing her\nbaby, and Dorothea had come to say good-night to her.“Really—quite?” said Celia. “Not anybody at all—if he were very\nwonderful indeed?”Dorothea shook her head slowly. “Not anybody at all. I have delightful\nplans. I should like to take a great deal of land, and drain it, and\nmake a little colony, where everybody should work, and all the work\nshould be done well. I should know every one of the people and be their\nfriend. I am going to have great consultations with Mr. Garth: he can\ntell me almost everything I want to know.”“Then you _will_ be happy, if you have a plan, Dodo?” said Celia.\n“Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he grows up, and then he\ncan help you.”"

  "content": "Sir James was informed that same night that Dorothea was really quite\nset against marrying anybody at all, and was going to take to “all\nsorts of plans,” just like what she used to have. Sir James made no\nremark. To his secret feeling there was something repulsive in a\nwoman’s second marriage, and no match would prevent him from feeling it\na sort of desecration for Dorothea. He was aware that the world would\nregard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially in relation to a\nwoman of one-and-twenty; the practice of “the world” being to treat of\na young widow’s second marriage as certain and probably near, and to\nsmile with meaning if the widow acts accordingly. But if Dorothea did\nchoose to espouse her solitude, he felt that the resolution would well\nbecome her.CHAPTER LVI.“How happy is he born and taught\nThat serveth not another’s will;\nWhose armor is his honest thought,\nAnd simple truth his only skill!\n. . . . . . .\nThis man is freed from servile bands\nOf hope to rise or fear to fall;\nLord of himself though not of lands;\nAnd having nothing yet hath all.”\n—SIR HENRY WOTTON.Dorothea’s confidence in Caleb Garth’s knowledge, which had begun on\nher hearing that he approved of her cottages, had grown fast during her\nstay at Freshitt, Sir James having induced her to take rides over the\ntwo estates in company with himself and Caleb, who quite returned her\nadmiration, and told his wife that Mrs. Casaubon had a head for\nbusiness most uncommon in a woman. It must be remembered that by\n“business” Caleb never meant money transactions, but the skilful\napplication of labor.“Most uncommon!” repeated Caleb. “She said a thing I often used to\nthink myself when I was a lad:—‘Mr. Garth, I should like to feel, if I\nlived to be old, that I had improved a great piece of land and built a\ngreat many good cottages, because the work is of a healthy kind while\nit is being done, and after it is done, men are the better for it.’\nThose were the very words: she sees into things in that way.”“But womanly, I hope,” said Mrs. Garth, half suspecting that Mrs.\nCasaubon might not hold the true principle of subordination.“Oh, you can’t think!” said Caleb, shaking his head. “You would like to\nhear her speak, Susan. She speaks in such plain words, and a voice like\nmusic. Bless me! it reminds me of bits in the ‘Messiah’—‘and\nstraightway there appeared a multitude of the heavenly host, praising\nGod and saying;’ it has a tone with it that satisfies your ear.”Caleb was very fond of music, and when he could afford it went to hear\nan oratorio that came within his reach, returning from it with a\nprofound reverence for this mighty structure of tones, which made him\nsit meditatively, looking on the floor and throwing much unutterable\nlanguage into his outstretched hands."

  "content": "With this good understanding between them, it was natural that Dorothea\nasked Mr. Garth to undertake any business connected with the three\nfarms and the numerous tenements attached to Lowick Manor; indeed, his\nexpectation of getting work for two was being fast fulfilled. As he\nsaid, “Business breeds.” And one form of business which was beginning\nto breed just then was the construction of railways. A projected line\nwas to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed\nin a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the\ninfant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of\nCaleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to\ntwo persons who were dear to him. The submarine railway may have its\ndifficulties; but the bed of the sea is not divided among various\nlanded proprietors with claims for damages not only measurable but\nsentimental. In the hundred to which Middlemarch belonged railways were\nas exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or the imminent horrors of\nCholera, and those who held the most decided views on the subject were\nwomen and landholders. Women both old and young regarded travelling by\nsteam as presumptuous and dangerous, and argued against it by saying\nthat nothing should induce them to get into a railway carriage; while\nproprietors, differing from each other in their arguments as much as\nMr. Solomon Featherstone differed from Lord Medlicote, were yet\nunanimous in the opinion that in selling land, whether to the Enemy of\nmankind or to a company obliged to purchase, these pernicious agencies\nmust be made to pay a very high price to landowners for permission to\ninjure mankind.But the slower wits, such as Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule, who both\noccupied land of their own, took a long time to arrive at this\nconclusion, their minds halting at the vivid conception of what it\nwould be to cut the Big Pasture in two, and turn it into three-cornered\nbits, which would be “nohow;” while accommodation-bridges and high\npayments were remote and incredible.“The cows will all cast their calves, brother,” said Mrs. Waule, in a\ntone of deep melancholy, “if the railway comes across the Near Close;\nand I shouldn’t wonder at the mare too, if she was in foal. It’s a poor\ntale if a widow’s property is to be spaded away, and the law say\nnothing to it. What’s to hinder ’em from cutting right and left if they\nbegin? It’s well known, _I_ can’t fight.”“The best way would be to say nothing, and set somebody on to send ’em\naway with a flea in their ear, when they came spying and measuring,”\nsaid Solomon. “Folks did that about Brassing, by what I can understand.\nIt’s all a pretence, if the truth was known, about their being forced\nto take one way. Let ’em go cutting in another parish. And I don’t\nbelieve in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of ruffians to\ntrample your crops. Where’s a company’s pocket?”“Brother Peter, God forgive him, got money out of a company,” said Mrs.\nWaule. “But that was for the manganese. That wasn’t for railways to\nblow you to pieces right and left.”“Well, there’s this to be said, Jane,” Mr. Solomon concluded, lowering\nhis voice in a cautious manner—“the more spokes we put in their wheel,\nthe more they’ll pay us to let ’em go on, if they must come whether or\nnot.”"

  "content": "This reasoning of Mr. Solomon’s was perhaps less thorough than he\nimagined, his cunning bearing about the same relation to the course of\nrailways as the cunning of a diplomatist bears to the general chill or\ncatarrh of the solar system. But he set about acting on his views in a\nthoroughly diplomatic manner, by stimulating suspicion. His side of\nLowick was the most remote from the village, and the houses of the\nlaboring people were either lone cottages or were collected in a hamlet\ncalled Frick, where a water-mill and some stone-pits made a little\ncentre of slow, heavy-shouldered industry.In the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public\nopinion in Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy\ncorner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding\nrather that it was likely to be against the poor man, and that\nsuspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it. Even the rumor\nof Reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in Frick,\nthere being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous grains to\nfatten Hiram Ford’s pig, or of a publican at the “Weights and Scales”\nwho would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the\nthree neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter. And without\ndistinct good of this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing\nwith the bragging of pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every\nknowing person. The men of Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given\nto fanaticism than to a strong muscular suspicion; less inclined to\nbelieve that they were peculiarly cared for by heaven, than to regard\nheaven itself as rather disposed to take them in—a disposition\nobservable in the weather."

  "content": "Thus the mind of Frick was exactly of the sort for Mr. Solomon\nFeatherstone to work upon, he having more plenteous ideas of the same\norder, with a suspicion of heaven and earth which was better fed and\nmore entirely at leisure. Solomon was overseer of the roads at that\ntime, and on his slow-paced cob often took his rounds by Frick to look\nat the workmen getting the stones there, pausing with a mysterious\ndeliberation, which might have misled you into supposing that he had\nsome other reason for staying than the mere want of impulse to move.\nAfter looking for a long while at any work that was going on, he would\nraise his eyes a little and look at the horizon; finally he would shake\nhis bridle, touch his horse with the whip, and get it to move slowly\nonward. The hour-hand of a clock was quick by comparison with Mr.\nSolomon, who had an agreeable sense that he could afford to be slow. He\nwas in the habit of pausing for a cautious, vaguely designing chat with\nevery hedger or ditcher on his way, and was especially willing to\nlisten even to news which he had heard before, feeling himself at an\nadvantage over all narrators in partially disbelieving them. One day,\nhowever, he got into a dialogue with Hiram Ford, a wagoner, in which he\nhimself contributed information. He wished to know whether Hiram had\nseen fellows with staves and instruments spying about: they called\nthemselves railroad people, but there was no telling what they were or\nwhat they meant to do. The least they pretended was that they were\ngoing to cut Lowick Parish into sixes and sevens.“Why, there’ll be no stirrin’ from one pla-ace to another,” said Hiram,\nthinking of his wagon and horses.“Not a bit,” said Mr. Solomon. “And cutting up fine land such as this\nparish! Let ’em go into Tipton, say I. But there’s no knowing what\nthere is at the bottom of it. Traffic is what they put for’ard; but\nit’s to do harm to the land and the poor man in the long-run.”“Why, they’re Lunnon chaps, I reckon,” said Hiram, who had a dim notion\nof London as a centre of hostility to the country.“Ay, to be sure. And in some parts against Brassing, by what I’ve heard\nsay, the folks fell on ’em when they were spying, and broke their\npeep-holes as they carry, and drove ’em away, so as they knew better\nthan come again.”“It war good foon, I’d be bound,” said Hiram, whose fun was much\nrestricted by circumstances.“Well, I wouldn’t meddle with ’em myself,” said Solomon. “But some say\nthis country’s seen its best days, and the sign is, as it’s being\noverrun with these fellows trampling right and left, and wanting to cut\nit up into railways; and all for the big traffic to swallow up the\nlittle, so as there shan’t be a team left on the land, nor a whip to\ncrack.”“I’ll crack _my_ whip about their ear’n, afore they bring it to that,\nthough,” said Hiram, while Mr. Solomon, shaking his bridle, moved\nonward.Nettle-seed needs no digging. The ruin of this countryside by railroads\nwas discussed, not only at the “Weights and Scales,” but in the\nhay-field, where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for\ntalk such as were rarely had through the rural year."

He put up his gig at Yoddrell’s, and in\nwalking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his\nwork, he encountered the party of the company’s agents, who were\nadjusting their spirit-level. After a little chat he left them,\nobserving that by-and-by they would reach him again where he was going\nto measure. It was one of those gray mornings after light rains, which\nbecome delicious about twelve o’clock, when the clouds part a little,\nand the scent of the earth is sweet along the lanes and by the\nhedgerows."

  "content": "The scent would have been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along\nthe lanes on horseback, if his mind had not been worried by\nunsuccessful efforts to imagine what he was to do, with his father on\none side expecting him straightway to enter the Church, with Mary on\nthe other threatening to forsake him if he did enter it, and with the\nworking-day world showing no eager need whatever of a young gentleman\nwithout capital and generally unskilled. It was the harder to Fred’s\ndisposition because his father, satisfied that he was no longer\nrebellious, was in good humor with him, and had sent him on this\npleasant ride to see after some greyhounds. Even when he had fixed on\nwhat he should do, there would be the task of telling his father. But\nit must be admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the\nmore difficult task:—what secular avocation on earth was there for a\nyoung man (whose friends could not get him an “appointment”) which was\nat once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special\nknowledge? Riding along the lanes by Frick in this mood, and slackening\nhis pace while he reflected whether he should venture to go round by\nLowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he could see over the hedges from one\nfield to another. Suddenly a noise roused his attention, and on the far\nside of a field on his left hand he could see six or seven men in\nsmock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive approach\ntowards the four railway agents who were facing them, while Caleb Garth\nand his assistant were hastening across the field to join the\nthreatened group. Fred, delayed a few moments by having to find the\ngate, could not gallop up to the spot before the party in smock-frocks,\nwhose work of turning the hay had not been too pressing after\nswallowing their mid-day beer, were driving the men in coats before\nthem with their hay-forks; while Caleb Garth’s assistant, a lad of\nseventeen, who had snatched up the spirit-level at Caleb’s order, had\nbeen knocked down and seemed to be lying helpless. The coated men had\nthe advantage as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting in\nfront of the smock-frocks and charging them suddenly enough to throw\ntheir chase into confusion. “What do you confounded fools mean?”\nshouted Fred, pursuing the divided group in a zigzag, and cutting right\nand left with his whip. “I’ll swear to every one of you before the\nmagistrate. You’ve knocked the lad down and killed him, for what I\nknow. You’ll every one of you be hanged at the next assizes, if you\ndon’t mind,” said Fred, who afterwards laughed heartily as he\nremembered his own phrases."
