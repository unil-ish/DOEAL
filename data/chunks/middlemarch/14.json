  "content": "But in the morning all the ordinary currents of conjecture were\ndisturbed by the presence of a strange mourner who had plashed among\nthem as if from the moon. This was the stranger described by Mrs.\nCadwallader as frog-faced: a man perhaps about two or three and thirty,\nwhose prominent eyes, thin-lipped, downward-curved mouth, and hair\nsleekly brushed away from a forehead that sank suddenly above the ridge\nof the eyebrows, certainly gave his face a batrachian unchangeableness\nof expression. Here, clearly, was a new legatee; else why was he bidden\nas a mourner? Here were new possibilities, raising a new uncertainty,\nwhich almost checked remark in the mourning-coaches. We are all\nhumiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed very\ncomfortably and perhaps been staring at us in private while we have\nbeen making up our world entirely without it. No one had seen this\nquestionable stranger before except Mary Garth, and she knew nothing\nmore of him than that he had twice been to Stone Court when Mr.\nFeatherstone was down-stairs, and had sat alone with him for several\nhours. She had found an opportunity of mentioning this to her father,\nand perhaps Caleb’s were the only eyes, except the lawyer’s, which\nexamined the stranger with more of inquiry than of disgust or\nsuspicion. Caleb Garth, having little expectation and less cupidity,\nwas interested in the verification of his own guesses, and the calmness\nwith which he half smilingly rubbed his chin and shot intelligent\nglances much as if he were valuing a tree, made a fine contrast with\nthe alarm or scorn visible in other faces when the unknown mourner,\nwhose name was understood to be Rigg, entered the wainscoted parlor and\ntook his seat near the door to make part of the audience when the will\nshould be read. Just then Mr. Solomon and Mr. Jonah were gone up-stairs\nwith the lawyer to search for the will; and Mrs. Waule, seeing two\nvacant seats between herself and Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had the spirit\nto move next to that great authority, who was handling his watch-seals\nand trimming his outlines with a determination not to show anything so\ncompromising to a man of ability as wonder or surprise."

  "content": "“I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother’s done, Mr.\nTrumbull,” said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of her woolly tones, while\nshe turned her crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr. Trumbull’s ear.“My good lady, whatever was told me was told in confidence,” said the\nauctioneer, putting his hand up to screen that secret.“Them who’ve made sure of their good-luck may be disappointed yet,”\nMrs. Waule continued, finding some relief in this communication.“Hopes are often delusive,” said Mr. Trumbull, still in confidence.“Ah!” said Mrs. Waule, looking across at the Vincys, and then moving\nback to the side of her sister Martha.“It’s wonderful how close poor Peter was,” she said, in the same\nundertones. “We none of us know what he might have had on his mind. I\nonly hope and trust he wasn’t a worse liver than we think of, Martha.”Poor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had the\nadditional motive for making her remarks unexceptionable and giving\nthem a general bearing, that even her whispers were loud and liable to\nsudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ.“I never _was_ covetous, Jane,” she replied; “but I have six children\nand have buried three, and I didn’t marry into money. The eldest, that\nsits there, is but nineteen—so I leave you to guess. And stock always\nshort, and land most awkward. But if ever I’ve begged and prayed; it’s\nbeen to God above; though where there’s one brother a bachelor and the\nother childless after twice marrying—anybody might think!”"

  "content": "Meanwhile, Mr. Vincy had glanced at the passive face of Mr. Rigg, and\nhad taken out his snuff-box and tapped it, but had put it again\nunopened as an indulgence which, however clarifying to the judgment,\nwas unsuited to the occasion. “I shouldn’t wonder if Featherstone had\nbetter feelings than any of us gave him credit for,” he observed, in\nthe ear of his wife. “This funeral shows a thought about everybody: it\nlooks well when a man wants to be followed by his friends, and if they\nare humble, not to be ashamed of them. I should be all the better\npleased if he’d left lots of small legacies. They may be uncommonly\nuseful to fellows in a small way.”“Everything is as handsome as could be, crape and silk and everything,”\nsaid Mrs. Vincy, contentedly.But I am sorry to say that Fred was under some difficulty in repressing\na laugh, which would have been more unsuitable than his father’s\nsnuff-box. Fred had overheard Mr. Jonah suggesting something about a\n“love-child,” and with this thought in his mind, the stranger’s face,\nwhich happened to be opposite him, affected him too ludicrously. Mary\nGarth, discerning his distress in the twitchings of his mouth, and his\nrecourse to a cough, came cleverly to his rescue by asking him to\nchange seats with her, so that he got into a shadowy corner. Fred was\nfeeling as good-naturedly as possible towards everybody, including\nRigg; and having some relenting towards all these people who were less\nlucky than he was aware of being himself, he would not for the world\nhave behaved amiss; still, it was particularly easy to laugh.But the entrance of the lawyer and the two brothers drew every one’s\nattention. The lawyer was Mr. Standish, and he had come to Stone Court\nthis morning believing that he knew thoroughly well who would be\npleased and who disappointed before the day was over. The will he\nexpected to read was the last of three which he had drawn up for Mr.\nFeatherstone. Mr. Standish was not a man who varied his manners: he\nbehaved with the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to everybody, as\nif he saw no difference in them, and talked chiefly of the hay-crop,\nwhich would be “very fine, by God!” of the last bulletins concerning\nthe King, and of the Duke of Clarence, who was a sailor every inch of\nhim, and just the man to rule over an island like Britain."

  "content": "Old Featherstone had often reflected as he sat looking at the fire that\nStandish would be surprised some day: it is true that if he had done as\nhe liked at the last, and burnt the will drawn up by another lawyer, he\nwould not have secured that minor end; still he had had his pleasure in\nruminating on it. And certainly Mr. Standish was surprised, but not at\nall sorry; on the contrary, he rather enjoyed the zest of a little\ncuriosity in his own mind, which the discovery of a second will added\nto the prospective amazement on the part of the Featherstone family.As to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, they were held in utter\nsuspense: it seemed to them that the old will would have a certain\nvalidity, and that there might be such an interlacement of poor Peter’s\nformer and latter intentions as to create endless “lawing” before\nanybody came by their own—an inconvenience which would have at least\nthe advantage of going all round. Hence the brothers showed a\nthoroughly neutral gravity as they re-entered with Mr. Standish; but\nSolomon took out his white handkerchief again with a sense that in any\ncase there would be affecting passages, and crying at funerals, however\ndry, was customarily served up in lawn.Perhaps the person who felt the most throbbing excitement at this\nmoment was Mary Garth, in the consciousness that it was she who had\nvirtually determined the production of this second will, which might\nhave momentous effects on the lot of some persons present. No soul\nexcept herself knew what had passed on that final night.“The will I hold in my hand,” said Mr. Standish, who, seated at the\ntable in the middle of the room, took his time about everything,\nincluding the coughs with which he showed a disposition to clear his\nvoice, “was drawn up by myself and executed by our deceased friend on\nthe 9th of August, 1825. But I find that there is a subsequent\ninstrument hitherto unknown to me, bearing date the 20th of July, 1826,\nhardly a year later than the previous one. And there is farther, I\nsee”—Mr. Standish was cautiously travelling over the document with his\nspectacles—“a codicil to this latter will, bearing date March 1, 1828.”“Dear, dear!” said sister Martha, not meaning to be audible, but driven\nto some articulation under this pressure of dates.“I shall begin by reading the earlier will,” continued Mr. Standish,\n“since such, as appears by his not having destroyed the document, was\nthe intention of deceased.”"

  "content": "The preamble was felt to be rather long, and several besides Solomon\nshook their heads pathetically, looking on the ground: all eyes avoided\nmeeting other eyes, and were chiefly fixed either on the spots in the\ntable-cloth or on Mr. Standish’s bald head; excepting Mary Garth’s.\nWhen all the rest were trying to look nowhere in particular, it was\nsafe for her to look at them. And at the sound of the first “give and\nbequeath” she could see all complexions changing subtly, as if some\nfaint vibration were passing through them, save that of Mr. Rigg. He\nsat in unaltered calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more\nimportant problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests\nwhich might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him. Fred\nblushed, and Mr. Vincy found it impossible to do without his snuff-box\nin his hand, though he kept it closed."

  "content": "The small bequests came first, and even the recollection that there was\nanother will and that poor Peter might have thought better of it, could\nnot quell the rising disgust and indignation. One likes to be done well\nby in every tense, past, present, and future. And here was Peter\ncapable five years ago of leaving only two hundred apiece to his own\nbrothers and sisters, and only a hundred apiece to his own nephews and\nnieces: the Garths were not mentioned, but Mrs. Vincy and Rosamond were\neach to have a hundred. Mr. Trumbull was to have the gold-headed cane\nand fifty pounds; the other second cousins and the cousins present were\neach to have the like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin\nobserved, was a sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was\nmuch more of such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not\npresent—problematical, and, it was to be feared, low connections.\nAltogether, reckoning hastily, here were about three thousand disposed\nof. Where then had Peter meant the rest of the money to go—and where\nthe land? and what was revoked and what not revoked—and was the\nrevocation for better or for worse? All emotion must be conditional,\nand might turn out to be the wrong thing. The men were strong enough to\nbear up and keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting their\nlower lip fall, others pursing it up, according to the habit of their\nmuscles. But Jane and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and\nbegan to cry; poor Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of\ngetting any hundreds at all without working for them, and half aware\nthat her share was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule’s mind was entirely\nflooded with the sense of being an own sister and getting little, while\nsomebody else was to have much. The general expectation now was that\nthe “much” would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves were\nsurprised when ten thousand pounds in specified investments were\ndeclared to be bequeathed to him:—was the land coming too? Fred bit his\nlips: it was difficult to help smiling, and Mrs. Vincy felt herself the\nhappiest of women—possible revocation shrinking out of sight in this\ndazzling vision."

  "content": "There was still a residue of personal property as well as the land, but\nthe whole was left to one person, and that person was—O possibilities!\nO expectations founded on the favor of “close” old gentlemen! O endless\nvocatives that would still leave expression slipping helpless from the\nmeasurement of mortal folly!—that residuary legatee was Joshua Rigg,\nwho was also sole executor, and who was to take thenceforth the name of\nFeatherstone.There was a rustling which seemed like a shudder running round the\nroom. Every one stared afresh at Mr. Rigg, who apparently experienced\nno surprise.“A most singular testamentary disposition!” exclaimed Mr. Trumbull,\npreferring for once that he should be considered ignorant in the past.\n“But there is a second will—there is a further document. We have not\nyet heard the final wishes of the deceased.”Mary Garth was feeling that what they had yet to hear were not the\nfinal wishes. The second will revoked everything except the legacies to\nthe low persons before mentioned (some alterations in these being the\noccasion of the codicil), and the bequest of all the land lying in\nLowick parish with all the stock and household furniture, to Joshua\nRigg. The residue of the property was to be devoted to the erection and\nendowment of almshouses for old men, to be called Featherstone’s\nAlms-Houses, and to be built on a piece of land near Middlemarch\nalready bought for the purpose by the testator, he wishing—so the\ndocument declared—to please God Almighty. Nobody present had a\nfarthing; but Mr. Trumbull had the gold-headed cane. It took some time\nfor the company to recover the power of expression. Mary dared not look\nat Fred."

I should say he was not in his right\nmind when he made it. I should say this last will was void,” added Mr.\nVincy, feeling that this expression put the thing in the true light.\n“Eh Standish?”“Our deceased friend always knew what he was about, I think,” said Mr.\nStandish. “Everything is quite regular. Here is a letter from Clemmens\nof Brassing tied with the will. He drew it up. A very respectable\nsolicitor.”“I never noticed any alienation of mind—any aberration of intellect in\nthe late Mr. Featherstone,” said Borthrop Trumbull, “but I call this\nwill eccentric. I was always willingly of service to the old soul; and\nhe intimated pretty plainly a sense of obligation which would show\nitself in his will. The gold-headed cane is farcical considered as an\nacknowledgment to me; but happily I am above mercenary considerations.”“There’s nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see,” said\nCaleb Garth. “Anybody might have had more reason for wondering if the\nwill had been what you might expect from an open-minded straightforward\nman. For my part, I wish there was no such thing as a will.”“That’s a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man, by God!” said\nthe lawyer. “I should like to know how you will back that up, Garth!”“Oh,” said Caleb, leaning forward, adjusting his finger-tips with\nnicety and looking meditatively on the ground. It always seemed to him\nthat words were the hardest part of “business.”But here Mr. Jonah Featherstone made himself heard. “Well, he always\nwas a fine hypocrite, was my brother Peter. But this will cuts out\neverything. If I’d known, a wagon and six horses shouldn’t have drawn\nme from Brassing. I’ll put a white hat and drab coat on to-morrow.”“Dear, dear,” wept Mrs. Cranch, “and we’ve been at the expense of\ntravelling, and that poor lad sitting idle here so long! It’s the first\ntime I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to please God\nAlmighty; but if I was to be struck helpless I must say it’s hard—I can\nthink no other.”"

  "content": "“It’ll do him no good where he’s gone, that’s my belief,” said Solomon,\nwith a bitterness which was remarkably genuine, though his tone could\nnot help being sly. “Peter was a bad liver, and almshouses won’t cover\nit, when he’s had the impudence to show it at the last.”“And all the while had got his own lawful family—brothers and sisters\nand nephews and nieces—and has sat in church with ’em whenever he\nthought well to come,” said Mrs. Waule. “And might have left his\nproperty so respectable, to them that’s never been used to extravagance\nor unsteadiness in no manner of way—and not so poor but what they could\nhave saved every penny and made more of it. And me—the trouble I’ve\nbeen at, times and times, to come here and be sisterly—and him with\nthings on his mind all the while that might make anybody’s flesh creep.\nBut if the Almighty’s allowed it, he means to punish him for it.\nBrother Solomon, I shall be going, if you’ll drive me.”“I’ve no desire to put my foot on the premises again,” said Solomon.\n“I’ve got land of my own and property of my own to will away.”“It’s a poor tale how luck goes in the world,” said Jonah. “It never\nanswers to have a bit of spirit in you. You’d better be a dog in the\nmanger. But those above ground might learn a lesson. One fool’s will is\nenough in a family.”“There’s more ways than one of being a fool,” said Solomon. “I shan’t\nleave my money to be poured down the sink, and I shan’t leave it to\nfoundlings from Africay. I like Featherstones that were brewed such,\nand not turned Featherstones with sticking the name on ’em.”Solomon addressed these remarks in a loud aside to Mrs. Waule as he\nrose to accompany her. Brother Jonah felt himself capable of much more\nstinging wit than this, but he reflected that there was no use in\noffending the new proprietor of Stone Court, until you were certain\nthat he was quite without intentions of hospitality towards witty men\nwhose name he was about to bear."

  "content": "Mr. Joshua Rigg, in fact, appeared to trouble himself little about any\ninnuendoes, but showed a notable change of manner, walking coolly up to\nMr. Standish and putting business questions with much coolness. He had\na high chirping voice and a vile accent. Fred, whom he no longer moved\nto laughter, thought him the lowest monster he had ever seen. But Fred\nwas feeling rather sick. The Middlemarch mercer waited for an\nopportunity of engaging Mr. Rigg in conversation: there was no knowing\nhow many pairs of legs the new proprietor might require hose for, and\nprofits were more to be relied on than legacies. Also, the mercer, as a\nsecond cousin, was dispassionate enough to feel curiosity.Mr. Vincy, after his one outburst, had remained proudly silent, though\ntoo much preoccupied with unpleasant feelings to think of moving, till\nhe observed that his wife had gone to Fred’s side and was crying\nsilently while she held her darling’s hand. He rose immediately, and\nturning his back on the company while he said to her in an\nundertone,—“Don’t give way, Lucy; don’t make a fool of yourself, my\ndear, before these people,” he added in his usual loud voice—“Go and\norder the phaeton, Fred; I have no time to waste.”Mary Garth had before this been getting ready to go home with her\nfather. She met Fred in the hall, and now for the first time had the\ncourage to look at him. He had that withered sort of paleness which\nwill sometimes come on young faces, and his hand was very cold when she\nshook it. Mary too was agitated; she was conscious that fatally,\nwithout will of her own, she had perhaps made a great difference to\nFred’s lot.“Good-by,” she said, with affectionate sadness. “Be brave, Fred. I do\nbelieve you are better without the money. What was the good of it to\nMr. Featherstone?”“That’s all very fine,” said Fred, pettishly. “What is a fellow to do?\nI must go into the Church now.” (He knew that this would vex Mary: very\nwell; then she must tell him what else he could do.) “And I thought I\nshould be able to pay your father at once and make everything right.\nAnd you have not even a hundred pounds left you. What shall you do now,\nMary?”“Take another situation, of course, as soon as I can get one. My father\nhas enough to do to keep the rest, without me. Good-by.”"

  "content": "In a very short time Stone Court was cleared of well-brewed\nFeatherstones and other long-accustomed visitors. Another stranger had\nbeen brought to settle in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, but in the\ncase of Mr. Rigg Featherstone there was more discontent with immediate\nvisible consequences than speculation as to the effect which his\npresence might have in the future. No soul was prophetic enough to have\nany foreboding as to what might appear on the trial of Joshua Rigg.And here I am naturally led to reflect on the means of elevating a low\nsubject. Historical parallels are remarkably efficient in this way. The\nchief objection to them is, that the diligent narrator may lack space,\nor (what is often the same thing) may not be able to think of them with\nany degree of particularity, though he may have a philosophical\nconfidence that if known they would be illustrative. It seems an easier\nand shorter way to dignity, to observe that—since there never was a\ntrue story which could not be told in parables, where you might put a\nmonkey for a margrave, and vice versa—whatever has been or is to be\nnarrated by me about low people, may be ennobled by being considered a\nparable; so that if any bad habits and ugly consequences are brought\ninto view, the reader may have the relief of regarding them as not more\nthan figuratively ungenteel, and may feel himself virtually in company\nwith persons of some style. Thus while I tell the truth about loobies,\nmy reader’s imagination need not be entirely excluded from an\noccupation with lords; and the petty sums which any bankrupt of high\nstanding would be sorry to retire upon, may be lifted to the level of\nhigh commercial transactions by the inexpensive addition of\nproportional ciphers.As to any provincial history in which the agents are all of high moral\nrank, that must be of a date long posterior to the first Reform Bill,\nand Peter Featherstone, you perceive, was dead and buried some months\nbefore Lord Grey came into office.CHAPTER XXXVI."

He was an\nopen-minded man, but given to indirect modes of expressing himself:\nwhen he was disappointed in a market for his silk braids, he swore at\nthe groom; when his brother-in-law Bulstrode had vexed him, he made\ncutting remarks on Methodism; and it was now apparent that he regarded\nFred’s idleness with a sudden increase of severity, by his throwing an\nembroidered cap out of the smoking-room on to the hall-floor.“Well, sir,” he observed, when that young gentleman was moving off to\nbed, “I hope you’ve made up your mind now to go up next term and pass\nyour examination. I’ve taken my resolution, so I advise you to lose no\ntime in taking yours.”Fred made no answer: he was too utterly depressed. Twenty-four hours\nago he had thought that instead of needing to know what he should do,\nhe should by this time know that he needed to do nothing: that he\nshould hunt in pink, have a first-rate hunter, ride to cover on a fine\nhack, and be generally respected for doing so; moreover, that he should\nbe able at once to pay Mr. Garth, and that Mary could no longer have\nany reason for not marrying him. And all this was to have come without\nstudy or other inconvenience, purely by the favor of providence in the\nshape of an old gentleman’s caprice. But now, at the end of the\ntwenty-four hours, all those firm expectations were upset. It was\n“rather hard lines” that while he was smarting under this\ndisappointment he should be treated as if he could have helped it. But\nhe went away silently and his mother pleaded for him."

And I call it a robbery: it was like giving him the land, to\npromise it; and what is promising, if making everybody believe is not\npromising? And you see he did leave him ten thousand pounds, and then\ntook it away again.”“Took it away again!” said Mr. Vincy, pettishly. “I tell you the lad’s\nan unlucky lad, Lucy. And you’ve always spoiled him.”“Well, Vincy, he was my first, and you made a fine fuss with him when\nhe came. You were as proud as proud,” said Mrs. Vincy, easily\nrecovering her cheerful smile.“Who knows what babies will turn to? I was fool enough, I dare say,”\nsaid the husband—more mildly, however.“But who has handsomer, better children than ours? Fred is far beyond\nother people’s sons: you may hear it in his speech, that he has kept\ncollege company. And Rosamond—where is there a girl like her? She might\nstand beside any lady in the land, and only look the better for it. You\nsee—Mr. Lydgate has kept the highest company and been everywhere, and\nhe fell in love with her at once. Not but what I could have wished\nRosamond had not engaged herself. She might have met somebody on a\nvisit who would have been a far better match; I mean at her\nschoolfellow Miss Willoughby’s. There are relations in that family\nquite as high as Mr. Lydgate’s.”“Damn relations!” said Mr. Vincy; “I’ve had enough of them. I don’t\nwant a son-in-law who has got nothing but his relations to recommend\nhim.”“Why, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, “you seemed as pleased as could be\nabout it. It’s true, I wasn’t at home; but Rosamond told me you hadn’t\na word to say against the engagement. And she has begun to buy in the\nbest linen and cambric for her underclothing.”“Not by my will,” said Mr. Vincy. “I shall have enough to do this year,\nwith an idle scamp of a son, without paying for wedding-clothes. The\ntimes are as tight as can be; everybody is being ruined; and I don’t\nbelieve Lydgate has got a farthing. I shan’t give my consent to their\nmarrying.

However, Mrs.\nVincy, who never willingly opposed her husband, lost no time the next\nmorning in letting Rosamond know what he had said. Rosamond, examining\nsome muslin-work, listened in silence, and at the end gave a certain\nturn of her graceful neck, of which only long experience could teach\nyou that it meant perfect obstinacy.“What do you say, my dear?” said her mother, with affectionate\ndeference.“Papa does not mean anything of the kind,” said Rosamond, quite calmly.\n“He has always said that he wished me to marry the man I loved. And I\nshall marry Mr. Lydgate. It is seven weeks now since papa gave his\nconsent. And I hope we shall have Mrs. Bretton’s house.”“Well, my dear, I shall leave you to manage your papa. You always do\nmanage everybody. But if we ever do go and get damask, Sadler’s is the\nplace—far better than Hopkins’s. Mrs. Bretton’s is very large, though:\nI should love you to have such a house; but it will take a great deal\nof furniture—carpeting and everything, besides plate and glass. And you\nhear, your papa says he will give no money. Do you think Mr. Lydgate\nexpects it?”“You cannot imagine that I should ask him, mamma. Of course he\nunderstands his own affairs.”“But he may have been looking for money, my dear, and we all thought of\nyour having a pretty legacy as well as Fred;—and now everything is so\ndreadful—there’s no pleasure in thinking of anything, with that poor\nboy disappointed as he is.”"

  "content": "Mrs. Vincy’s belief that Rosamond could manage her papa was well\nfounded. Apart from his dinners and his coursing, Mr. Vincy, blustering\nas he was, had as little of his own way as if he had been a prime\nminister: the force of circumstances was easily too much for him, as it\nis for most pleasure-loving florid men; and the circumstance called\nRosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild persistence\nwhich, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to make its\nway in spite of opposing rock. Papa was not a rock: he had no other\nfixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called habit,\nand this was altogether unfavorable to his taking the only decisive\nline of conduct in relation to his daughter’s engagement—namely, to\ninquire thoroughly into Lydgate’s circumstances, declare his own\ninability to furnish money, and forbid alike either a speedy marriage\nor an engagement which must be too lengthy. That seems very simple and\neasy in the statement; but a disagreeable resolve formed in the chill\nhours of the morning had as many conditions against it as the early\nfrost, and rarely persisted under the warming influences of the day.\nThe indirect though emphatic expression of opinion to which Mr. Vincy\nwas prone suffered much restraint in this case: Lydgate was a proud man\ntowards whom innuendoes were obviously unsafe, and throwing his hat on\nthe floor was out of the question. Mr. Vincy was a little in awe of\nhim, a little vain that he wanted to marry Rosamond, a little\nindisposed to raise a question of money in which his own position was\nnot advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a\nman better educated and more highly bred than himself, and a little\nafraid of doing what his daughter would not like. The part Mr. Vincy\npreferred playing was that of the generous host whom nobody criticises.\nIn the earlier half of the day there was business to hinder any formal\ncommunication of an adverse resolve; in the later there was dinner,\nwine, whist, and general satisfaction. And in the mean while the hours\nwere each leaving their little deposit and gradually forming the final\nreason for inaction, namely, that action was too late. The accepted\nlover spent most of his evenings in Lowick Gate, and a love-making not\nat all dependent on money-advances from fathers-in-law, or prospective\nincome from a profession, went on flourishingly under Mr. Vincy’s own\neyes. Young love-making—that gossamer web! Even the points it clings\nto—the things whence its subtle interlacings are swung—are scarcely\nperceptible: momentary touches of fingertips, meetings of rays from\nblue and dark orbs, unfinished phrases, lightest changes of cheek and\nlip, faintest tremors. The web itself is made of spontaneous beliefs\nand indefinable joys, yearnings of one life towards another, visions of\ncompleteness, indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to spinning that web\nfrom his inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of experience\nsupposed to be finished off with the drama of Laure—in spite too of\nmedicine and biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes\npresented in a dish (like Santa Lucia’s), and other incidents of\nscientific inquiry, are observed to be less incompatible with poetic\nlove than a native dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose.\nAs for Rosamond, she was in the water-lily’s expanding wonderment at\nits own fuller life, and she too was spinning industriously at the\nmutual web. All this went on in the corner of the drawing-room where\nthe piano stood, and subtle as it was, the light made it a sort of\nrainbow visible to many observers besides Mr. Farebrother. The\ncertainty that Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate were engaged became general\nin Middlemarch without the aid of formal announcement."

His replies were not satisfactory.“Walter, you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go\non without inquiry into Mr. Lydgate’s prospects?” said Mrs. Bulstrode,\nopening her eyes with wider gravity at her brother, who was in his\npeevish warehouse humor. “Think of this girl brought up in luxury—in\ntoo worldly a way, I am sorry to say—what will she do on a small\nincome?”“Oh, confound it, Harriet! What can I do when men come into the town\nwithout any asking of mine? Did you shut your house up against Lydgate?\nBulstrode has pushed him forward more than anybody. I never made any\nfuss about the young fellow. You should go and talk to your husband\nabout it, not me.”“Well, really, Walter, how can Mr. Bulstrode be to blame? I am sure he\ndid not wish for the engagement.”“Oh, if Bulstrode had not taken him by the hand, I should never have\ninvited him.”“But you called him in to attend on Fred, and I am sure that was a\nmercy,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, losing her clew in the intricacies of the\nsubject.“I don’t know about mercy,” said Mr. Vincy, testily. “I know I am\nworried more than I like with my family. I was a good brother to you,\nHarriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say he doesn’t always\nshow that friendly spirit towards your family that might have been\nexpected of him.” Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no\naccomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly. Harriet\nhad to defend her husband instead of blaming her brother, and the\nconversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent\nsparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting."

He did not\nshare her warm interest, however; and only spoke with resignation of\nthe risks attendant on the beginning of medical practice and the\ndesirability of prudence.“I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl—brought up as\nshe has been,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, wishing to rouse her husband’s\nfeelings.“Truly, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, assentingly. “Those who are not\nof this world can do little else to arrest the errors of the\nobstinately worldly. That is what we must accustom ourselves to\nrecognize with regard to your brother’s family. I could have wished\nthat Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union; but my relations\nwith him are limited to that use of his gifts for God’s purposes which\nis taught us by the divine government under each dispensation.”Mrs. Bulstrode said no more, attributing some dissatisfaction which she\nfelt to her own want of spirituality. She believed that her husband was\none of those men whose memoirs should be written when they died.As to Lydgate himself, having been accepted, he was prepared to accept\nall the consequences which he believed himself to foresee with perfect\nclearness. Of course he must be married in a year—perhaps even in half\na year. This was not what he had intended; but other schemes would not\nbe hindered: they would simply adjust themselves anew. Marriage, of\ncourse, must be prepared for in the usual way. A house must be taken\ninstead of the rooms he at present occupied; and Lydgate, having heard\nRosamond speak with admiration of old Mrs. Bretton’s house (situated in\nLowick Gate), took notice when it fell vacant after the old lady’s\ndeath, and immediately entered into treaty for it."

On the contrary, he would have despised any\nostentation of expense; his profession had familiarized him with all\ngrades of poverty, and he cared much for those who suffered hardships.\nHe would have behaved perfectly at a table where the sauce was served\nin a jug with the handle off, and he would have remembered nothing\nabout a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But\nit had never occurred to him that he should live in any other than what\nhe would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and\nexcellent waiting at table. In warming himself at French social\ntheories he had brought away no smell of scorching. We may handle even\nextreme opinions with impunity while our furniture, our dinner-giving,\nand preference for armorial bearings in our own case, link us\nindissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate’s tendency was not\ntowards extreme opinions: he would have liked no barefooted doctrines,\nbeing particular about his boots: he was no radical in relation to\nanything but medical reform and the prosecution of discovery. In the\nrest of practical life he walked by hereditary habit; half from that\npersonal pride and unreflecting egoism which I have already called\ncommonness, and half from that naivete which belonged to preoccupation\nwith favorite ideas.Any inward debate Lydgate had as to the consequences of this engagement\nwhich had stolen upon him, turned on the paucity of time rather than of\nmoney. Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some\none who always turned out to be prettier than memory could represent\nher to be, did interfere with the diligent use of spare hours which\nmight serve some “plodding fellow of a German” to make the great,\nimminent discovery. This was really an argument for not deferring the\nmarriage too long, as he implied to Mr. Farebrother, one day that the\nVicar came to his room with some pond-products which he wanted to\nexamine under a better microscope than his own, and, finding Lydgate’s\ntableful of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically—“Eros has degenerated; he began by introducing order and harmony, and\nnow he brings back chaos.”“Yes, at some stages,” said Lydgate, lifting his brows and smiling,\nwhile he began to arrange his microscope. “But a better order will\nbegin after.”“Soon?” said the Vicar.“I hope so, really. This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time,\nand when one has notions in science, every moment is an opportunity. I\nfeel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to\nwork steadily. He has everything at home then—no teasing with personal\nspeculations—he can get calmness and freedom.”“You are an enviable dog,” said the Vicar, “to have such a\nprospect—Rosamond, calmness and freedom, all to your share. Here am I\nwith nothing but my pipe and pond-animalcules. Now, are you ready?”"

  "content": "Lydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason he had for wishing\nto shorten the period of courtship. It was rather irritating to him,\neven with the wine of love in his veins, to be obliged to mingle so\noften with the family party at the Vincys’, and to enter so much into\nMiddlemarch gossip, protracted good cheer, whist-playing, and general\nfutility. He had to be deferential when Mr. Vincy decided questions\nwith trenchant ignorance, especially as to those liquors which were the\nbest inward pickle, preserving you from the effects of bad air. Mrs.\nVincy’s openness and simplicity were quite unstreaked with suspicion as\nto the subtle offence she might give to the taste of her intended\nson-in-law; and altogether Lydgate had to confess to himself that he\nwas descending a little in relation to Rosamond’s family. But that\nexquisite creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:—it was at\nleast one delightful thought that in marrying her, he could give her a\nmuch-needed transplantation.“Dear!” he said to her one evening, in his gentlest tone, as he sat\ndown by her and looked closely at her face—But I must first say that he had found her alone in the drawing-room,\nwhere the great old-fashioned window, almost as large as the side of\nthe room, was opened to the summer scents of the garden at the back of\nthe house. Her father and mother were gone to a party, and the rest\nwere all out with the butterflies.“Dear! your eyelids are red.”“Are they?” said Rosamond. “I wonder why.” It was not in her nature to\npour forth wishes or grievances. They only came forth gracefully on\nsolicitation.“As if you could hide it from me!” said Lydgate, laying his hand\ntenderly on both of hers. “Don’t I see a tiny drop on one of the\nlashes? Things trouble you, and you don’t tell me. That is unloving.”“Why should I tell you what you cannot alter? They are every-day\nthings:—perhaps they have been a little worse lately.”“Family annoyances. Don’t fear speaking. I guess them.”“Papa has been more irritable lately. Fred makes him angry, and this\nmorning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his\nwhole education away, and do something quite beneath him. And besides—”Rosamond hesitated, and her cheeks were gathering a slight flush.\nLydgate had never seen her in trouble since the morning of their\nengagement, and he had never felt so passionately towards her as at\nthis moment. He kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage\nthem.“I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,” Rosamond\ncontinued, almost in a whisper; “and he said last night that he should\ncertainly speak to you and say it must be given up.”“Will you give it up?” said Lydgate, with quick energy—almost angrily.“I never give up anything that I choose to do,” said Rosamond,\nrecovering her calmness at the touching of this chord.“God bless you!” said Lydgate, kissing her again. This constancy of\npurpose in the right place was adorable. He went on:—"

If anything is done\nto make you unhappy,—that is a reason for hastening our marriage.”An unmistakable delight shone forth from the blue eyes that met his,\nand the radiance seemed to light up all his future with mild sunshine.\nIdeal happiness (of the kind known in the Arabian Nights, in which you\nare invited to step from the labor and discord of the street into a\nparadise where everything is given to you and nothing claimed) seemed\nto be an affair of a few weeks’ waiting, more or less.“Why should we defer it?” he said, with ardent insistence. “I have\ntaken the house now: everything else can soon be got ready—can it not?\nYou will not mind about new clothes. Those can be bought afterwards.”“What original notions you clever men have!” said Rosamond, dimpling\nwith more thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity.\n“This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought\nafter marriage.”“But you don’t mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for\nthe sake of clothes?” said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was\ntormenting him prettily, and half fearing that she really shrank from\nspeedy marriage. “Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of\nhappiness even than this—being continually together, independent of\nothers, and ordering our lives as we will. Come, dear, tell me how soon\nyou can be altogether mine.”There was a serious pleading in Lydgate’s tone, as if he felt that she\nwould be injuring him by any fantastic delays. Rosamond became serious\ntoo, and slightly meditative; in fact, she was going through many\nintricacies of lace-edging and hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order\nto give an answer that would at least be approximative.“Six weeks would be ample—say so, Rosamond,” insisted Lydgate,\nreleasing her hands to put his arm gently round her.One little hand immediately went to pat her hair, while she gave her\nneck a meditative turn, and then said seriously—“There would be the house-linen and the furniture to be prepared.\nStill, mamma could see to those while we were away.”"

She looked at her lover with\nsome wondering remonstrance as she spoke, and he readily understood\nthat she might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double solitude.“Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed. But let us take\na decided course, and put an end to any discomfort you may be\nsuffering. Six weeks!—I am sure they would be ample.”“I could certainly hasten the work,” said Rosamond. “Will you, then,\nmention it to papa?—I think it would be better to write to him.” She\nblushed and looked at him as the garden flowers look at us when we walk\nforth happily among them in the transcendent evening light: is there\nnot a soul beyond utterance, half nymph, half child, in those delicate\npetals which glow and breathe about the centres of deep color?"
