He was an\nopen-minded man, but given to indirect modes of expressing himself:\nwhen he was disappointed in a market for his silk braids, he swore at\nthe groom; when his brother-in-law Bulstrode had vexed him, he made\ncutting remarks on Methodism; and it was now apparent that he regarded\nFred’s idleness with a sudden increase of severity, by his throwing an\nembroidered cap out of the smoking-room on to the hall-floor.“Well, sir,” he observed, when that young gentleman was moving off to\nbed, “I hope you’ve made up your mind now to go up next term and pass\nyour examination. I’ve taken my resolution, so I advise you to lose no\ntime in taking yours.”Fred made no answer: he was too utterly depressed. Twenty-four hours\nago he had thought that instead of needing to know what he should do,\nhe should by this time know that he needed to do nothing: that he\nshould hunt in pink, have a first-rate hunter, ride to cover on a fine\nhack, and be generally respected for doing so; moreover, that he should\nbe able at once to pay Mr. Garth, and that Mary could no longer have\nany reason for not marrying him. And all this was to have come without\nstudy or other inconvenience, purely by the favor of providence in the\nshape of an old gentleman’s caprice. But now, at the end of the\ntwenty-four hours, all those firm expectations were upset. It was\n“rather hard lines” that while he was smarting under this\ndisappointment he should be treated as if he could have helped it. But\nhe went away silently and his mother pleaded for him."

I feel as sure as I sit here, Fred\nwill turn out well—else why was he brought back from the brink of the\ngrave? And I call it a robbery: it was like giving him the land, to\npromise it; and what is promising, if making everybody believe is not\npromising? And you see he did leave him ten thousand pounds, and then\ntook it away again.”“Took it away again!” said Mr. Vincy, pettishly. “I tell you the lad’s\nan unlucky lad, Lucy. And you’ve always spoiled him.”“Well, Vincy, he was my first, and you made a fine fuss with him when\nhe came. You were as proud as proud,” said Mrs. Vincy, easily\nrecovering her cheerful smile.“Who knows what babies will turn to? I was fool enough, I dare say,”\nsaid the husband—more mildly, however.“But who has handsomer, better children than ours? Fred is far beyond\nother people’s sons: you may hear it in his speech, that he has kept\ncollege company. And Rosamond—where is there a girl like her? She might\nstand beside any lady in the land, and only look the better for it. You\nsee—Mr. Lydgate has kept the highest company and been everywhere, and\nhe fell in love with her at once. Not but what I could have wished\nRosamond had not engaged herself. She might have met somebody on a\nvisit who would have been a far better match; I mean at her\nschoolfellow Miss Willoughby’s. There are relations in that family\nquite as high as Mr. Lydgate’s.”“Damn relations!” said Mr. Vincy; “I’ve had enough of them. I don’t\nwant a son-in-law who has got nothing but his relations to recommend\nhim.”“Why, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, “you seemed as pleased as could be\nabout it. It’s true, I wasn’t at home; but Rosamond told me you hadn’t\na word to say against the engagement. And she has begun to buy in the\nbest linen and cambric for her underclothing.”“Not by my will,” said Mr. Vincy. “I shall have enough to do this year,\nwith an idle scamp of a son, without paying for wedding-clothes. The\ntimes are as tight as can be; everybody is being ruined; and I don’t\nbelieve Lydgate has got a farthing. I shan’t give my consent to their\nmarrying. Let ’em wait, as their elders have done before ’em.”“Rosamond will take it hard, Vincy, and you know you never could bear\nto cross her.”"

He makes\nenemies; that’s all I hear of his making.”“But he stands very high with Mr. Bulstrode, my dear. The marriage\nwould please _him_, I should think.”“Please the deuce!” said Mr. Vincy. “Bulstrode won’t pay for their\nkeep. And if Lydgate thinks I’m going to give money for them to set up\nhousekeeping, he’s mistaken, that’s all. I expect I shall have to put\ndown my horses soon. You’d better tell Rosy what I say.”This was a not infrequent procedure with Mr. Vincy—to be rash in jovial\nassent, and on becoming subsequently conscious that he had been rash,\nto employ others in making the offensive retractation. However, Mrs.\nVincy, who never willingly opposed her husband, lost no time the next\nmorning in letting Rosamond know what he had said. Rosamond, examining\nsome muslin-work, listened in silence, and at the end gave a certain\nturn of her graceful neck, of which only long experience could teach\nyou that it meant perfect obstinacy.“What do you say, my dear?” said her mother, with affectionate\ndeference.“Papa does not mean anything of the kind,” said Rosamond, quite calmly.\n“He has always said that he wished me to marry the man I loved. And I\nshall marry Mr. Lydgate. It is seven weeks now since papa gave his\nconsent. And I hope we shall have Mrs. Bretton’s house.”“Well, my dear, I shall leave you to manage your papa. You always do\nmanage everybody. But if we ever do go and get damask, Sadler’s is the\nplace—far better than Hopkins’s. Mrs. Bretton’s is very large, though:\nI should love you to have such a house; but it will take a great deal\nof furniture—carpeting and everything, besides plate and glass. And you\nhear, your papa says he will give no money. Do you think Mr. Lydgate\nexpects it?”“You cannot imagine that I should ask him, mamma. Of course he\nunderstands his own affairs.”“But he may have been looking for money, my dear, and we all thought of\nyour having a pretty legacy as well as Fred;—and now everything is so\ndreadful—there’s no pleasure in thinking of anything, with that poor\nboy disappointed as he is.”"

  "content": "Mrs. Vincy’s belief that Rosamond could manage her papa was well\nfounded. Apart from his dinners and his coursing, Mr. Vincy, blustering\nas he was, had as little of his own way as if he had been a prime\nminister: the force of circumstances was easily too much for him, as it\nis for most pleasure-loving florid men; and the circumstance called\nRosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild persistence\nwhich, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to make its\nway in spite of opposing rock. Papa was not a rock: he had no other\nfixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called habit,\nand this was altogether unfavorable to his taking the only decisive\nline of conduct in relation to his daughter’s engagement—namely, to\ninquire thoroughly into Lydgate’s circumstances, declare his own\ninability to furnish money, and forbid alike either a speedy marriage\nor an engagement which must be too lengthy. That seems very simple and\neasy in the statement; but a disagreeable resolve formed in the chill\nhours of the morning had as many conditions against it as the early\nfrost, and rarely persisted under the warming influences of the day.\nThe indirect though emphatic expression of opinion to which Mr. Vincy\nwas prone suffered much restraint in this case: Lydgate was a proud man\ntowards whom innuendoes were obviously unsafe, and throwing his hat on\nthe floor was out of the question. Mr. Vincy was a little in awe of\nhim, a little vain that he wanted to marry Rosamond, a little\nindisposed to raise a question of money in which his own position was\nnot advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a\nman better educated and more highly bred than himself, and a little\nafraid of doing what his daughter would not like. The part Mr. Vincy\npreferred playing was that of the generous host whom nobody criticises.\nIn the earlier half of the day there was business to hinder any formal\ncommunication of an adverse resolve; in the later there was dinner,\nwine, whist, and general satisfaction. And in the mean while the hours\nwere each leaving their little deposit and gradually forming the final\nreason for inaction, namely, that action was too late. The accepted\nlover spent most of his evenings in Lowick Gate, and a love-making not\nat all dependent on money-advances from fathers-in-law, or prospective\nincome from a profession, went on flourishingly under Mr. Vincy’s own\neyes. Young love-making—that gossamer web! Even the points it clings\nto—the things whence its subtle interlacings are swung—are scarcely\nperceptible: momentary touches of fingertips, meetings of rays from\nblue and dark orbs, unfinished phrases, lightest changes of cheek and\nlip, faintest tremors. The web itself is made of spontaneous beliefs\nand indefinable joys, yearnings of one life towards another, visions of\ncompleteness, indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to spinning that web\nfrom his inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of experience\nsupposed to be finished off with the drama of Laure—in spite too of\nmedicine and biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes\npresented in a dish (like Santa Lucia’s), and other incidents of\nscientific inquiry, are observed to be less incompatible with poetic\nlove than a native dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose.\nAs for Rosamond, she was in the water-lily’s expanding wonderment at\nits own fuller life, and she too was spinning industriously at the\nmutual web. All this went on in the corner of the drawing-room where\nthe piano stood, and subtle as it was, the light made it a sort of\nrainbow visible to many observers besides Mr. Farebrother. The\ncertainty that Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate were engaged became general\nin Middlemarch without the aid of formal announcement."

His replies were not satisfactory.“Walter, you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go\non without inquiry into Mr. Lydgate’s prospects?” said Mrs. Bulstrode,\nopening her eyes with wider gravity at her brother, who was in his\npeevish warehouse humor. “Think of this girl brought up in luxury—in\ntoo worldly a way, I am sorry to say—what will she do on a small\nincome?”“Oh, confound it, Harriet! What can I do when men come into the town\nwithout any asking of mine? Did you shut your house up against Lydgate?\nBulstrode has pushed him forward more than anybody. I never made any\nfuss about the young fellow. You should go and talk to your husband\nabout it, not me.”“Well, really, Walter, how can Mr. Bulstrode be to blame? I am sure he\ndid not wish for the engagement.”“Oh, if Bulstrode had not taken him by the hand, I should never have\ninvited him.”“But you called him in to attend on Fred, and I am sure that was a\nmercy,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, losing her clew in the intricacies of the\nsubject.“I don’t know about mercy,” said Mr. Vincy, testily. “I know I am\nworried more than I like with my family. I was a good brother to you,\nHarriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say he doesn’t always\nshow that friendly spirit towards your family that might have been\nexpected of him.” Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no\naccomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly. Harriet\nhad to defend her husband instead of blaming her brother, and the\nconversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent\nsparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting."

He did not\nshare her warm interest, however; and only spoke with resignation of\nthe risks attendant on the beginning of medical practice and the\ndesirability of prudence.“I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl—brought up as\nshe has been,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, wishing to rouse her husband’s\nfeelings.“Truly, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, assentingly. “Those who are not\nof this world can do little else to arrest the errors of the\nobstinately worldly. That is what we must accustom ourselves to\nrecognize with regard to your brother’s family. I could have wished\nthat Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union; but my relations\nwith him are limited to that use of his gifts for God’s purposes which\nis taught us by the divine government under each dispensation.”Mrs. Bulstrode said no more, attributing some dissatisfaction which she\nfelt to her own want of spirituality. She believed that her husband was\none of those men whose memoirs should be written when they died.As to Lydgate himself, having been accepted, he was prepared to accept\nall the consequences which he believed himself to foresee with perfect\nclearness. Of course he must be married in a year—perhaps even in half\na year. This was not what he had intended; but other schemes would not\nbe hindered: they would simply adjust themselves anew. Marriage, of\ncourse, must be prepared for in the usual way. A house must be taken\ninstead of the rooms he at present occupied; and Lydgate, having heard\nRosamond speak with admiration of old Mrs. Bretton’s house (situated in\nLowick Gate), took notice when it fell vacant after the old lady’s\ndeath, and immediately entered into treaty for it."

  "content": "He did this in an episodic way, very much as he gave orders to his\ntailor for every requisite of perfect dress, without any notion of\nbeing extravagant. On the contrary, he would have despised any\nostentation of expense; his profession had familiarized him with all\ngrades of poverty, and he cared much for those who suffered hardships.\nHe would have behaved perfectly at a table where the sauce was served\nin a jug with the handle off, and he would have remembered nothing\nabout a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But\nit had never occurred to him that he should live in any other than what\nhe would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and\nexcellent waiting at table. In warming himself at French social\ntheories he had brought away no smell of scorching. We may handle even\nextreme opinions with impunity while our furniture, our dinner-giving,\nand preference for armorial bearings in our own case, link us\nindissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate’s tendency was not\ntowards extreme opinions: he would have liked no barefooted doctrines,\nbeing particular about his boots: he was no radical in relation to\nanything but medical reform and the prosecution of discovery. In the\nrest of practical life he walked by hereditary habit; half from that\npersonal pride and unreflecting egoism which I have already called\ncommonness, and half from that naivete which belonged to preoccupation\nwith favorite ideas.Any inward debate Lydgate had as to the consequences of this engagement\nwhich had stolen upon him, turned on the paucity of time rather than of\nmoney. Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some\none who always turned out to be prettier than memory could represent\nher to be, did interfere with the diligent use of spare hours which\nmight serve some “plodding fellow of a German” to make the great,\nimminent discovery. This was really an argument for not deferring the\nmarriage too long, as he implied to Mr. Farebrother, one day that the\nVicar came to his room with some pond-products which he wanted to\nexamine under a better microscope than his own, and, finding Lydgate’s\ntableful of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically—“Eros has degenerated; he began by introducing order and harmony, and\nnow he brings back chaos.”“Yes, at some stages,” said Lydgate, lifting his brows and smiling,\nwhile he began to arrange his microscope. “But a better order will\nbegin after.”“Soon?” said the Vicar.“I hope so, really. This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time,\nand when one has notions in science, every moment is an opportunity. I\nfeel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to\nwork steadily. He has everything at home then—no teasing with personal\nspeculations—he can get calmness and freedom.”“You are an enviable dog,” said the Vicar, “to have such a\nprospect—Rosamond, calmness and freedom, all to your share. Here am I\nwith nothing but my pipe and pond-animalcules. Now, are you ready?”"

  "content": "Lydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason he had for wishing\nto shorten the period of courtship. It was rather irritating to him,\neven with the wine of love in his veins, to be obliged to mingle so\noften with the family party at the Vincys’, and to enter so much into\nMiddlemarch gossip, protracted good cheer, whist-playing, and general\nfutility. He had to be deferential when Mr. Vincy decided questions\nwith trenchant ignorance, especially as to those liquors which were the\nbest inward pickle, preserving you from the effects of bad air. Mrs.\nVincy’s openness and simplicity were quite unstreaked with suspicion as\nto the subtle offence she might give to the taste of her intended\nson-in-law; and altogether Lydgate had to confess to himself that he\nwas descending a little in relation to Rosamond’s family. But that\nexquisite creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:—it was at\nleast one delightful thought that in marrying her, he could give her a\nmuch-needed transplantation.“Dear!” he said to her one evening, in his gentlest tone, as he sat\ndown by her and looked closely at her face—But I must first say that he had found her alone in the drawing-room,\nwhere the great old-fashioned window, almost as large as the side of\nthe room, was opened to the summer scents of the garden at the back of\nthe house. Her father and mother were gone to a party, and the rest\nwere all out with the butterflies.“Dear! your eyelids are red.”“Are they?” said Rosamond. “I wonder why.” It was not in her nature to\npour forth wishes or grievances. They only came forth gracefully on\nsolicitation.“As if you could hide it from me!” said Lydgate, laying his hand\ntenderly on both of hers. “Don’t I see a tiny drop on one of the\nlashes? Things trouble you, and you don’t tell me. That is unloving.”“Why should I tell you what you cannot alter? They are every-day\nthings:—perhaps they have been a little worse lately.”“Family annoyances. Don’t fear speaking. I guess them.”“Papa has been more irritable lately. Fred makes him angry, and this\nmorning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his\nwhole education away, and do something quite beneath him. And besides—”Rosamond hesitated, and her cheeks were gathering a slight flush.\nLydgate had never seen her in trouble since the morning of their\nengagement, and he had never felt so passionately towards her as at\nthis moment. He kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage\nthem.“I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,” Rosamond\ncontinued, almost in a whisper; “and he said last night that he should\ncertainly speak to you and say it must be given up.”“Will you give it up?” said Lydgate, with quick energy—almost angrily.“I never give up anything that I choose to do,” said Rosamond,\nrecovering her calmness at the touching of this chord.“God bless you!” said Lydgate, kissing her again. This constancy of\npurpose in the right place was adorable. He went on:—"

Those can be bought afterwards.”“What original notions you clever men have!” said Rosamond, dimpling\nwith more thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity.\n“This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought\nafter marriage.”“But you don’t mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for\nthe sake of clothes?” said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was\ntormenting him prettily, and half fearing that she really shrank from\nspeedy marriage. “Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of\nhappiness even than this—being continually together, independent of\nothers, and ordering our lives as we will. Come, dear, tell me how soon\nyou can be altogether mine.”There was a serious pleading in Lydgate’s tone, as if he felt that she\nwould be injuring him by any fantastic delays. Rosamond became serious\ntoo, and slightly meditative; in fact, she was going through many\nintricacies of lace-edging and hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order\nto give an answer that would at least be approximative.“Six weeks would be ample—say so, Rosamond,” insisted Lydgate,\nreleasing her hands to put his arm gently round her.One little hand immediately went to pat her hair, while she gave her\nneck a meditative turn, and then said seriously—“There would be the house-linen and the furniture to be prepared.\nStill, mamma could see to those while we were away.”"

She looked at her lover with\nsome wondering remonstrance as she spoke, and he readily understood\nthat she might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double solitude.“Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed.

Six weeks!—I am sure they would be ample.”“I could certainly hasten the work,” said Rosamond. “Will you, then,\nmention it to papa?—I think it would be better to write to him.” She\nblushed and looked at him as the garden flowers look at us when we walk\nforth happily among them in the transcendent evening light: is there\nnot a soul beyond utterance, half nymph, half child, in those delicate\npetals which glow and breathe about the centres of deep color?"

Rosamond thought\nthat no one could be more in love than she was; and Lydgate thought\nthat after all his wild mistakes and absurd credulity, he had found\nperfect womanhood—felt as if already breathed upon by exquisite wedded\naffection such as would be bestowed by an accomplished creature who\nvenerated his high musings and momentous labors and would never\ninterfere with them; who would create order in the home and accounts\nwith still magic, yet keep her fingers ready to touch the lute and\ntransform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the\ntrue womanly limit and not a hair’s-breadth beyond—docile, therefore,\nand ready to carry out behests which came from that limit. It was\nplainer now than ever that his notion of remaining much longer a\nbachelor had been a mistake: marriage would not be an obstruction but a\nfurtherance. And happening the next day to accompany a patient to\nBrassing, he saw a dinner-service there which struck him as so exactly\nthe right thing that he bought it at once. It saved time to do these\nthings just when you thought of them, and Lydgate hated ugly crockery.\nThe dinner-service in question was expensive, but that might be in the\nnature of dinner-services. Furnishing was necessarily expensive; but\nthen it had to be done only once.“It must be lovely,” said Mrs. Vincy, when Lydgate mentioned his\npurchase with some descriptive touches. “Just what Rosy ought to have.\nI trust in heaven it won’t be broken!”“One must hire servants who will not break things,” said Lydgate.\n(Certainly, this was reasoning with an imperfect vision of sequences.\nBut at that period there was no sort of reasoning which was not more or\nless sanctioned by men of science.)Of course it was unnecessary to defer the mention of anything to mamma,\nwho did not readily take views that were not cheerful, and being a\nhappy wife herself, had hardly any feeling but pride in her daughter’s\nmarriage. But Rosamond had good reasons for suggesting to Lydgate that\npapa should be appealed to in writing. She prepared for the arrival of\nthe letter by walking with her papa to the warehouse the next morning,\nand telling him on the way that Mr. Lydgate wished to be married soon.“Nonsense, my dear!” said Mr. Vincy. “What has he got to marry on?\nYou’d much better give up the engagement. I’ve told you so pretty\nplainly before this. What have you had such an education for, if you\nare to go and marry a poor man? It’s a cruel thing for a father to\nsee.”“Mr. Lydgate is not poor, papa. He bought Mr. Peacock’s practice,\nwhich, they say, is worth eight or nine hundred a-year.”“Stuff and nonsense! What’s buying a practice? He might as well buy\nnext year’s swallows. It’ll all slip through his fingers.”“On the contrary, papa, he will increase the practice. See how he has\nbeen called in by the Chettams and Casaubons.”“I hope he knows I shan’t give anything—with this disappointment about\nFred, and Parliament going to be dissolved, and machine-breaking\neverywhere, and an election coming on—”“Dear papa! what can that have to do with my marriage?”"

This was a delightfully\nreassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, but in the mean time not a\nself-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make everything comfortable\nabout Rosamond’s marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with\nmuch spirit. Not without prudential considerations, however. A bride\n(who is going to visit at a baronet’s) must have a few first-rate\npocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary half-dozen,\nRosamond contented herself without the very highest style of embroidery\nand Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that his sum of eight hundred\npounds had been considerably reduced since he had come to Middlemarch,\nrestrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was\nshown to him when he went into Kibble’s establishment at Brassing to\nbuy forks and spoons. He was too proud to act as if he presupposed that\nMr. Vincy would advance money to provide furniture; and though, since\nit would not be necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills\nwould be left standing over, he did not waste time in conjecturing how\nmuch his father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment\neasy. He was not going to do anything extravagant, but the requisite\nthings must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy them of a\npoor quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that\nscience and his profession were the objects he should alone pursue\nenthusiastically; but he could not imagine himself pursuing them in\nsuch a home as Wrench had—the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the\nchildren in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones,\nblack-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched\nlymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl;\nand he must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic\napparatus.Rosamond, however, was on her side much occupied with conjectures,\nthough her quick imitative perception warned her against betraying them\ntoo crudely.“I shall like so much to know your family,” she said one day, when the\nwedding journey was being discussed. “We might perhaps take a direction\nthat would allow us to see them as we returned. Which of your uncles do\nyou like best?”“Oh,—my uncle Godwin, I think. He is a good-natured old fellow.”“You were constantly at his house at Quallingham, when you were a boy,\nwere you not? I should so like to see the old spot and everything you\nwere used to. Does he know you are going to be married?”“No,” said Lydgate, carelessly, turning in his chair and rubbing his\nhair up.“Do send him word of it, you naughty undutiful nephew. He will perhaps\nask you to take me to Quallingham; and then you could show me about the\ngrounds, and I could imagine you there when you were a boy. Remember,\nyou see me in my home, just as it has been since I was a child. It is\nnot fair that I should be so ignorant of yours. But perhaps you would\nbe a little ashamed of me. I forgot that.”Lydgate smiled at her tenderly, and really accepted the suggestion that\nthe proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some\ntrouble. And now he came to think of it, he would like to see the old\nspots with Rosamond.“I will write to him, then. But my cousins are bores.”It seemed magnificent to Rosamond to be able to speak so slightingly of\na baronet’s family, and she felt much contentment in the prospect of\nbeing able to estimate them contemptuously on her own account.But mamma was near spoiling all, a day or two later, by saying—“I hope your uncle Sir Godwin will not look down on Rosy, Mr. Lydgate.\nI should think he would do something handsome. A thousand or two can be\nnothing to a baronet.”"

  "content": "“Mamma!” said Rosamond, blushing deeply; and Lydgate pitied her so much\nthat he remained silent and went to the other end of the room to\nexamine a print curiously, as if he had been absent-minded. Mamma had a\nlittle filial lecture afterwards, and was docile as usual. But Rosamond\nreflected that if any of those high-bred cousins who were bores, should\nbe induced to visit Middlemarch, they would see many things in her own\nfamily which might shock them. Hence it seemed desirable that Lydgate\nshould by-and-by get some first-rate position elsewhere than in\nMiddlemarch; and this could hardly be difficult in the case of a man\nwho had a titled uncle and could make discoveries. Lydgate, you\nperceive, had talked fervidly to Rosamond of his hopes as to the\nhighest uses of his life, and had found it delightful to be listened to\nby a creature who would bring him the sweet furtherance of satisfying\naffection—beauty—repose—such help as our thoughts get from the summer\nsky and the flower-fringed meadows.Lydgate relied much on the psychological difference between what for\nthe sake of variety I will call goose and gander: especially on the\ninnate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the\nstrength of the gander.CHAPTER XXXVII.Thrice happy she that is so well assured\nUnto herself and settled so in heart\nThat neither will for better be allured\nNe fears to worse with any chance to start,\nBut like a steddy ship doth strongly part\nThe raging waves and keeps her course aright;\nNe aught for tempest doth from it depart,\nNe aught for fairer weather’s false delight.\nSuch self-assurance need not fear the spight\nOf grudging foes; ne favour seek of friends;\nBut in the stay of her own stedfast might\nNeither to one herself nor other bends.\n    Most happy she that most assured doth rest,\n    But he most happy who such one loves best.\n—SPENSER."

  "content": "The doubt hinted by Mr. Vincy whether it were only the general election\nor the end of the world that was coming on, now that George the Fourth\nwas dead, Parliament dissolved, Wellington and Peel generally\ndepreciated and the new King apologetic, was a feeble type of the\nuncertainties in provincial opinion at that time. With the glow-worm\nlights of country places, how could men see which were their own\nthoughts in the confusion of a Tory Ministry passing Liberal measures,\nof Tory nobles and electors being anxious to return Liberals rather\nthan friends of the recreant Ministers, and of outcries for remedies\nwhich seemed to have a mysteriously remote bearing on private interest,\nand were made suspicious by the advocacy of disagreeable neighbors?\nBuyers of the Middlemarch newspapers found themselves in an anomalous\nposition: during the agitation on the Catholic Question many had given\nup the “Pioneer”—which had a motto from Charles James Fox and was in\nthe van of progress—because it had taken Peel’s side about the Papists,\nand had thus blotted its Liberalism with a toleration of Jesuitry and\nBaal; but they were ill-satisfied with the “Trumpet,” which—since its\nblasts against Rome, and in the general flaccidity of the public mind\n(nobody knowing who would support whom)—had become feeble in its\nblowing.It was a time, according to a noticeable article in the “Pioneer,” when\nthe crying needs of the country might well counteract a reluctance to\npublic action on the part of men whose minds had from long experience\nacquired breadth as well as concentration, decision of judgment as well\nas tolerance, dispassionateness as well as energy—in fact, all those\nqualities which in the melancholy experience of mankind have been the\nleast disposed to share lodgings.Mr. Hackbutt, whose fluent speech was at that time floating more widely\nthan usual, and leaving much uncertainty as to its ultimate channel,\nwas heard to say in Mr. Hawley’s office that the article in question\n“emanated” from Brooke of Tipton, and that Brooke had secretly bought\nthe “Pioneer” some months ago.“That means mischief, eh?” said Mr. Hawley. “He’s got the freak of\nbeing a popular man now, after dangling about like a stray tortoise. So\nmuch the worse for him. I’ve had my eye on him for some time. He shall\nbe prettily pumped upon. He’s a damned bad landlord. What business has\nan old county man to come currying favor with a low set of dark-blue\nfreemen? As to his paper, I only hope he may do the writing himself. It\nwould be worth our paying for.”“I understand he has got a very brilliant young fellow to edit it, who\ncan write the highest style of leading article, quite equal to anything\nin the London papers. And he means to take very high ground on Reform.”“Let Brooke reform his rent-roll. He’s a cursed old screw, and the\nbuildings all over his estate are going to rack. I suppose this young\nfellow is some loose fish from London.”“His name is Ladislaw. He is said to be of foreign extraction.”“I know the sort,” said Mr. Hawley; “some emissary. He’ll begin with\nflourishing about the Rights of Man and end with murdering a wench.\nThat’s the style.”"

  "content": "“You must concede that there are abuses, Hawley,” said Mr. Hackbutt,\nforeseeing some political disagreement with his family lawyer. “I\nmyself should never favor immoderate views—in fact I take my stand with\nHuskisson—but I cannot blind myself to the consideration that the\nnon-representation of large towns—”“Large towns be damned!” said Mr. Hawley, impatient of exposition. “I\nknow a little too much about Middlemarch elections. Let ’em quash every\npocket borough to-morrow, and bring in every mushroom town in the\nkingdom—they’ll only increase the expense of getting into Parliament. I\ngo upon facts.”Mr. Hawley’s disgust at the notion of the “Pioneer” being edited by an\nemissary, and of Brooke becoming actively political—as if a tortoise of\ndesultory pursuits should protrude its small head ambitiously and\nbecome rampant—was hardly equal to the annoyance felt by some members\nof Mr. Brooke’s own family. The result had oozed forth gradually, like\nthe discovery that your neighbor has set up an unpleasant kind of\nmanufacture which will be permanently under your nostrils without legal\nremedy. The “Pioneer” had been secretly bought even before Will\nLadislaw’s arrival, the expected opportunity having offered itself in\nthe readiness of the proprietor to part with a valuable property which\ndid not pay; and in the interval since Mr. Brooke had written his\ninvitation, those germinal ideas of making his mind tell upon the world\nat large which had been present in him from his younger years, but had\nhitherto lain in some obstruction, had been sprouting under cover.The development was much furthered by a delight in his guest which\nproved greater even than he had anticipated. For it seemed that Will\nwas not only at home in all those artistic and literary subjects which\nMr. Brooke had gone into at one time, but that he was strikingly ready\nat seizing the points of the political situation, and dealing with them\nin that large spirit which, aided by adequate memory, lends itself to\nquotation and general effectiveness of treatment."

  "content": "“He seems to me a kind of Shelley, you know,” Mr. Brooke took an\nopportunity of saying, for the gratification of Mr. Casaubon. “I don’t\nmean as to anything objectionable—laxities or atheism, or anything of\nthat kind, you know—Ladislaw’s sentiments in every way I am sure are\ngood—indeed, we were talking a great deal together last night. But he\nhas the same sort of enthusiasm for liberty, freedom, emancipation—a\nfine thing under guidance—under guidance, you know. I think I shall be\nable to put him on the right tack; and I am the more pleased because he\nis a relation of yours, Casaubon.”If the right tack implied anything more precise than the rest of Mr.\nBrooke’s speech, Mr. Casaubon silently hoped that it referred to some\noccupation at a great distance from Lowick. He had disliked Will while\nhe helped him, but he had begun to dislike him still more now that Will\nhad declined his help. That is the way with us when we have any uneasy\njealousy in our disposition: if our talents are chiefly of the\nburrowing kind, our honey-sipping cousin (whom we have grave reasons\nfor objecting to) is likely to have a secret contempt for us, and any\none who admires him passes an oblique criticism on ourselves. Having\nthe scruples of rectitude in our souls, we are above the meanness of\ninjuring him—rather we meet all his claims on us by active benefits;\nand the drawing of cheques for him, being a superiority which he must\nrecognize, gives our bitterness a milder infusion. Now Mr. Casaubon had\nbeen deprived of that superiority (as anything more than a remembrance)\nin a sudden, capricious manner. His antipathy to Will did not spring\nfrom the common jealousy of a winter-worn husband: it was something\ndeeper, bred by his lifelong claims and discontents; but Dorothea, now\nthat she was present—Dorothea, as a young wife who herself had shown an\noffensive capability of criticism, necessarily gave concentration to\nthe uneasiness which had before been vague."

  "content": "Will Ladislaw on his side felt that his dislike was flourishing at the\nexpense of his gratitude, and spent much inward discourse in justifying\nthe dislike. Casaubon hated him—he knew that very well; on his first\nentrance he could discern a bitterness in the mouth and a venom in the\nglance which would almost justify declaring war in spite of past\nbenefits. He was much obliged to Casaubon in the past, but really the\nact of marrying this wife was a set-off against the obligation. It was\na question whether gratitude which refers to what is done for one’s\nself ought not to give way to indignation at what is done against\nanother. And Casaubon had done a wrong to Dorothea in marrying her. A\nman was bound to know himself better than that, and if he chose to grow\ngray crunching bones in a cavern, he had no business to be luring a\ngirl into his companionship. “It is the most horrible of\nvirgin-sacrifices,” said Will; and he painted to himself what were\nDorothea’s inward sorrows as if he had been writing a choric wail. But\nhe would never lose sight of her: he would watch over her—if he gave up\neverything else in life he would watch over her, and she should know\nthat she had one slave in the world. Will had—to use Sir Thomas\nBrowne’s phrase—a “passionate prodigality” of statement both to himself\nand others. The simple truth was that nothing then invited him so\nstrongly as the presence of Dorothea.Invitations of the formal kind had been wanting, however, for Will had\nnever been asked to go to Lowick. Mr. Brooke, indeed, confident of\ndoing everything agreeable which Casaubon, poor fellow, was too much\nabsorbed to think of, had arranged to bring Ladislaw to Lowick several\ntimes (not neglecting meanwhile to introduce him elsewhere on every\nopportunity as “a young relative of Casaubon’s”). And though Will had\nnot seen Dorothea alone, their interviews had been enough to restore\nher former sense of young companionship with one who was cleverer than\nherself, yet seemed ready to be swayed by her. Poor Dorothea before her\nmarriage had never found much room in other minds for what she cared\nmost to say; and she had not, as we know, enjoyed her husband’s\nsuperior instruction so much as she had expected. If she spoke with any\nkeenness of interest to Mr. Casaubon, he heard her with an air of\npatience as if she had given a quotation from the Delectus familiar to\nhim from his tender years, and sometimes mentioned curtly what ancient\nsects or personages had held similar ideas, as if there were too much\nof that sort in stock already; at other times he would inform her that\nshe was mistaken, and reassert what her remark had questioned.But Will Ladislaw always seemed to see more in what she said than she\nherself saw. Dorothea had little vanity, but she had the ardent woman’s\nneed to rule beneficently by making the joy of another soul. Hence the\nmere chance of seeing Will occasionally was like a lunette opened in\nthe wall of her prison, giving her a glimpse of the sunny air; and this\npleasure began to nullify her original alarm at what her husband might\nthink about the introduction of Will as her uncle’s guest. On this\nsubject Mr. Casaubon had remained dumb."

  "content": "But Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient of slow\ncircumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse between Dante\nand Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the proportion of\nthings, and in later days it is preferable to have fewer sonnets and\nmore conversation. Necessity excused stratagem, but stratagem was\nlimited by the dread of offending Dorothea. He found out at last that\nhe wanted to take a particular sketch at Lowick; and one morning when\nMr. Brooke had to drive along the Lowick road on his way to the county\ntown, Will asked to be set down with his sketch-book and camp-stool at\nLowick, and without announcing himself at the Manor settled himself to\nsketch in a position where he must see Dorothea if she came out to\nwalk—and he knew that she usually walked an hour in the morning.But the stratagem was defeated by the weather. Clouds gathered with\ntreacherous quickness, the rain came down, and Will was obliged to take\nshelter in the house. He intended, on the strength of relationship, to\ngo into the drawing-room and wait there without being announced; and\nseeing his old acquaintance the butler in the hall, he said, “Don’t\nmention that I am here, Pratt; I will wait till luncheon; I know Mr.\nCasaubon does not like to be disturbed when he is in the library.”“Master is out, sir; there’s only Mrs. Casaubon in the library. I’d\nbetter tell her you’re here, sir,” said Pratt, a red-cheeked man given\nto lively converse with Tantripp, and often agreeing with her that it\nmust be dull for Madam.“Oh, very well; this confounded rain has hindered me from sketching,”\nsaid Will, feeling so happy that he affected indifference with\ndelightful ease.In another minute he was in the library, and Dorothea was meeting him\nwith her sweet unconstrained smile.“Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon’s,” she said, at once. “I\ndon’t know whether he will be at home again long before dinner. He was\nuncertain how long he should be. Did you want to say anything\nparticular to him?”“No; I came to sketch, but the rain drove me in. Else I would not have\ndisturbed you yet. I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here, and I know he\ndislikes interruption at this hour.”“I am indebted to the rain, then. I am so glad to see you.” Dorothea\nuttered these common words with the simple sincerity of an unhappy\nchild, visited at school.“I really came for the chance of seeing you alone,” said Will,\nmysteriously forced to be just as simple as she was. He could not stay\nto ask himself, why not? “I wanted to talk about things, as we did in\nRome. It always makes a difference when other people are present.”"

  "content": "“Yes,” said Dorothea, in her clear full tone of assent. “Sit down.” She\nseated herself on a dark ottoman with the brown books behind her,\nlooking in her plain dress of some thin woollen-white material, without\na single ornament on her besides her wedding-ring, as if she were under\na vow to be different from all other women; and Will sat down opposite\nher at two yards’ distance, the light falling on his bright curls and\ndelicate but rather petulant profile, with its defiant curves of lip\nand chin. Each looked at the other as if they had been two flowers\nwhich had opened then and there. Dorothea for the moment forgot her\nhusband’s mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at\nher thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had\nfound receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she\nexaggerated a past solace.“I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,” she\nsaid, immediately. “It seems strange to me how many things I said to\nyou.”“I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content in his\nsoul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be\nperfectly loved. I think his own feelings at that moment were perfect,\nfor we mortals have our divine moments, when love is satisfied in the\ncompleteness of the beloved object.“I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,” said\nDorothea. “I can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to understand\njust a little Greek. I can help Mr. Casaubon better now. I can find out\nreferences for him and save his eyes in many ways. But it is very\ndifficult to be learned; it seems as if people were worn out on the way\nto great thoughts, and can never enjoy them because they are too\ntired.”“If a man has a capacity for great thoughts, he is likely to overtake\nthem before he is decrepit,” said Will, with irrepressible quickness.\nBut through certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick as he, and\nseeing her face change, he added, immediately, “But it is quite true\nthat the best minds have been sometimes overstrained in working out\ntheir ideas.”“You correct me,” said Dorothea. “I expressed myself ill. I should have\nsaid that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in working\nthem out. I used to feel about that, even when I was a little girl; and\nit always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life\nwould be to help some one who did great works, so that his burthen\nmight be lighter.”"
