See,” continued the Vicar,\nopening several small drawers, “I fancy I have made an exhaustive study\nof the entomology of this district. I am going on both with the fauna\nand flora; but I have at least done my insects well. We are singularly\nrich in orthoptera: I don’t know whether—Ah! you have got hold of that\nglass jar—you are looking into that instead of my drawers. You don’t\nreally care about these things?”“Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster. I have never had\ntime to give myself much to natural history. I was early bitten with an\ninterest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my\nprofession. I have no hobby besides. I have the sea to swim in there.”“Ah! you are a happy fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, turning on his heel\nand beginning to fill his pipe. “You don’t know what it is to want\nspiritual tobacco—bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a\nvariety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known signature of\nPhilomicron, for the ‘Twaddler’s Magazine;’ or a learned treatise on\nthe entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not\nmentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites in their passage\nthrough the desert; with a monograph on the Ant, as treated by Solomon,\nshowing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern\nresearch. You don’t mind my fumigating you?”Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its\nimplied meaning—that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the right\nvocation. The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the bookcase\nfilled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History, made him\nthink again of the winnings at cards and their destination. But he was\nbeginning to wish that the very best construction of everything that\nMr. Farebrother did should be the true one. The Vicar’s frankness\nseemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy\nconsciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but simply\nthe relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible.\nApparently he was not without a sense that his freedom of speech might\nseem premature, for he presently said—"

I was a correspondent of his,\nand he told me a good deal about you. I was not quite sure when you\nfirst came that you were the same man. I was very glad when I found\nthat you were. Only I don’t forget that you have not had the like\nprologue about me.”Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here, but did not half\nunderstand it. “By the way,” he said, “what has become of Trawley? I\nhave quite lost sight of him. He was hot on the French social systems,\nand talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of Pythagorean\ncommunity. Is he gone?”“Not at all. He is practising at a German bath, and has married a rich\npatient.”“Then my notions wear the best, so far,” said Lydgate, with a short\nscornful laugh. “He would have it, the medical profession was an\ninevitable system of humbug. I said, the fault was in the men—men who\ntruckle to lies and folly. Instead of preaching against humbug outside\nthe walls, it might be better to set up a disinfecting apparatus\nwithin. In short—I am reporting my own conversation—you may be sure I\nhad all the good sense on my side.”“Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the\nPythagorean community, though. You have not only got the old Adam in\nyourself against you, but you have got all those descendants of the\noriginal Adam who form the society around you. You see, I have paid\ntwelve or thirteen years more than you for my knowledge of\ndifficulties. But”—Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment, and then added,\n“you are eying that glass vase again. Do you want to make an exchange?\nYou shall not have it without a fair barter.”“I have some sea-mice—fine specimens—in spirits. And I will throw in\nRobert Brown’s new thing—‘Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of\nPlants’—if you don’t happen to have it already.”"

You must learn to be bored, remember. However, you shall\nhave the monster on your own terms.”“Don’t you think men overrate the necessity for humoring everybody’s\nnonsense, till they get despised by the very fools they humor?” said\nLydgate, moving to Mr. Farebrother’s side, and looking rather absently\nat the insects ranged in fine gradation, with names subscribed in\nexquisite writing. “The shortest way is to make your value felt, so\nthat people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.”“With all my heart. But then you must be sure of having the value, and\nyou must keep yourself independent. Very few men can do that. Either\nyou slip out of service altogether, and become good for nothing, or you\nwear the harness and draw a good deal where your yoke-fellows pull you.\nBut do look at these delicate orthoptera!”Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the Vicar\nlaughing at himself, and yet persisting in the exhibition.“Apropos of what you said about wearing harness,” Lydgate began, after\nthey had sat down, “I made up my mind some time ago to do with as\nlittle of it as possible. That was why I determined not to try anything\nin London, for a good many years at least. I didn’t like what I saw\nwhen I was studying there—so much empty bigwiggism, and obstructive\ntrickery. In the country, people have less pretension to knowledge, and\nare less of companions, but for that reason they affect one’s\namour-propre less: one makes less bad blood, and can follow one’s own\ncourse more quietly.”“Yes—well—you have got a good start; you are in the right profession,\nthe work you feel yourself most fit for. Some people miss that, and\nrepent too late. But you must not be too sure of keeping your\nindependence.”“You mean of family ties?” said Lydgate, conceiving that these might\npress rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother."

There’s a parishioner of mine—a fine fellow, but who\nwould hardly have pulled through as he has done without his wife. Do\nyou know the Garths? I think they were not Peacock’s patients.”“No; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone’s, at Lowick.”“Their daughter: an excellent girl.”“She is very quiet—I have hardly noticed her.”“She has taken notice of you, though, depend upon it.”“I don’t understand,” said Lydgate; he could hardly say “Of course.”“Oh, she gauges everybody. I prepared her for confirmation—she is a\nfavorite of mine.”Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence, Lydgate not caring to\nknow more about the Garths. At last the Vicar laid down his pipe,\nstretched out his legs, and turned his bright eyes with a smile towards\nLydgate, saying—“But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take us to be. We have\nour intrigues and our parties. I am a party man, for example, and\nBulstrode is another. If you vote for me you will offend Bulstrode.”“What is there against Bulstrode?” said Lydgate, emphatically.“I did not say there was anything against him except that. If you vote\nagainst him you will make him your enemy.”“I don’t know that I need mind about that,” said Lydgate, rather\nproudly; “but he seems to have good ideas about hospitals, and he\nspends large sums on useful public objects. He might help me a good\ndeal in carrying out my ideas. As to his religious notions—why, as\nVoltaire said, incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if\nadministered with a certain quantity of arsenic. I look for the man who\nwill bring the arsenic, and don’t mind about his incantations.”"

  "content": "“Very good. But then you must not offend your arsenic-man. You will not\noffend me, you know,” said Mr. Farebrother, quite unaffectedly. “I\ndon’t translate my own convenience into other people’s duties. I am\nopposed to Bulstrode in many ways. I don’t like the set he belongs to:\nthey are a narrow ignorant set, and do more to make their neighbors\nuncomfortable than to make them better. Their system is a sort of\nworldly-spiritual cliqueism: they really look on the rest of mankind as\na doomed carcass which is to nourish them for heaven. But,” he added,\nsmilingly, “I don’t say that Bulstrode’s new hospital is a bad thing;\nand as to his wanting to oust me from the old one—why, if he thinks me\na mischievous fellow, he is only returning a compliment. And I am not a\nmodel clergyman—only a decent makeshift.”Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself. A model\nclergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think his own profession the\nfinest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his\nmoral pathology and therapeutics. He only said, “What reason does\nBulstrode give for superseding you?”“That I don’t teach his opinions—which he calls spiritual religion; and\nthat I have no time to spare. Both statements are true. But then I\ncould make time, and I should be glad of the forty pounds. That is the\nplain fact of the case. But let us dismiss it. I only wanted to tell\nyou that if you vote for your arsenic-man, you are not to cut me in\nconsequence. I can’t spare you. You are a sort of circumnavigator come\nto settle among us, and will keep up my belief in the antipodes. Now\ntell me all about them in Paris.”CHAPTER XVIII.“Oh, sir, the loftiest hopes on earth\nDraw lots with meaner hopes: heroic breasts,\nBreathing bad air, run risk of pestilence;\nOr, lacking lime-juice when they cross the Line,\nMay languish with the scurvy.”Some weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the\nchaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate, and without\ntelling himself the reason, he deferred the predetermination on which\nside he should give his vote. It would really have been a matter of\ntotal indifference to him—that is to say, he would have taken the more\nconvenient side, and given his vote for the appointment of Tyke without\nany hesitation—if he had not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother."

  "content": "But his liking for the Vicar of St. Botolph’s grew with growing\nacquaintanceship. That, entering into Lydgate’s position as a new-comer\nwho had his own professional objects to secure, Mr. Farebrother should\nhave taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain his interest, showed\nan unusual delicacy and generosity, which Lydgate’s nature was keenly\nalive to. It went along with other points of conduct in Mr. Farebrother\nwhich were exceptionally fine, and made his character resemble those\nsouthern landscapes which seem divided between natural grandeur and\nsocial slovenliness. Very few men could have been as filial and\nchivalrous as he was to the mother, aunt, and sister, whose dependence\non him had in many ways shaped his life rather uneasily for himself;\nfew men who feel the pressure of small needs are so nobly resolute not\nto dress up their inevitably self-interested desires in a pretext of\nbetter motives. In these matters he was conscious that his life would\nbear the closest scrutiny; and perhaps the consciousness encouraged a\nlittle defiance towards the critical strictness of persons whose\ncelestial intimacies seemed not to improve their domestic manners, and\nwhose lofty aims were not needed to account for their actions. Then,\nhis preaching was ingenious and pithy, like the preaching of the\nEnglish Church in its robust age, and his sermons were delivered\nwithout book. People outside his parish went to hear him; and, since to\nfill the church was always the most difficult part of a clergyman’s\nfunction, here was another ground for a careless sense of superiority.\nBesides, he was a likable man: sweet-tempered, ready-witted, frank,\nwithout grins of suppressed bitterness or other conversational flavors\nwhich make half of us an affliction to our friends. Lydgate liked him\nheartily, and wished for his friendship."

  "content": "With this feeling uppermost, he continued to waive the question of the\nchaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper\nbusiness of his, but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for\nhis vote. Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode’s request, was laying down plans\nfor the internal arrangements of the new hospital, and the two were\noften in consultation. The banker was always presupposing that he could\ncount in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made no special\nrecurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When\nthe General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had\nnotice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of\nthe directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had\na vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch\nbusiness. He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration\nthat Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair was a\nquestion of office or no office; and he could not help an equally\npronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office. For his\nobservation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother’s assurance that\nthe banker would not overlook opposition. “Confound their petty\npolitics!” was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative\nprocess of shaving, when he had begun to feel that he must really hold\na court of conscience on this matter. Certainly there were valid things\nto be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother: he had too much on\nhis hands already, especially considering how much time he spent on\nnon-clerical occupations. Then again it was a continually repeated\nshock, disturbing Lydgate’s esteem, that the Vicar should obviously\nplay for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently\nliking some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended on theory\nfor the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen’s wit was\nstagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have\nplayed very much less but for the money. There was a billiard-room at\nthe Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and wives regarded as the\nchief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar was a first-rate\nbilliard-player, and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon, there\nwere reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had\nwon money. And as to the chaplaincy, he did not pretend that he cared\nfor it, except for the sake of the forty pounds. Lydgate was no\nPuritan, but he did not care for play, and winning money at it had\nalways seemed a meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of life which\nmade this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums\nthoroughly hateful to him. Hitherto in his own life his wants had been\nsupplied without any trouble to himself, and his first impulse was\nalways to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a\ngentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting\nhalf-crowns. He had always known in a general way that he was not rich,\nbut he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part\nwhich the want of money plays in determining the actions of men. Money\nhad never been a motive to him. Hence he was not ready to frame excuses\nfor this deliberate pursuit of small gains. It was altogether repulsive\nto him, and he never entered into any calculation of the ratio between\nthe Vicar’s income and his more or less necessary expenditure. It was\npossible that he would not have made such a calculation in his own\ncase."

One\nwould know much better what to do if men’s characters were more\nconsistent, and especially if one’s friends were invariably fit for any\nfunction they desired to undertake! Lydgate was convinced that if there\nhad been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother, he would have voted for\nhim, whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject: he did not\nintend to be a vassal of Bulstrode’s. On the other hand, there was\nTyke, a man entirely given to his clerical office, who was simply\ncurate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter’s parish, and had time for\nextra duty. Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that\nthey could not bear him, and suspected him of cant. Really, from his\npoint of view, Bulstrode was thoroughly justified."

  "content": "But whichever way Lydgate began to incline, there was something to make\nhim wince; and being a proud man, he was a little exasperated at being\nobliged to wince. He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by\ngetting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he did not like voting against\nFarebrother, and helping to deprive him of function and salary; and the\nquestion occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave\nthe Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards. Moreover,\nLydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he\nshould be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself. But\nwould the end really be his own convenience? Other people would say so,\nand would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake\nof making himself important and getting on in the world. What then? He\nfor his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been\nconcerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s\nfriendship or enmity. What he really cared for was a medium for his\nwork, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound to\nprefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could\ndemonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic\nresults, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For the\nfirst time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of\nsmall social conditions, and their frustrating complexity. At the end\nof his inward debate, when he set out for the hospital, his hope was\nreally in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to\nthe question, and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for\nvoting. I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is\nbegotten by circumstances—some feeling rushing warmly and making\nresolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more\ndifficult. However it was, he did not distinctly say to himself on\nwhich side he would vote; and all the while he was inwardly resenting\nthe subjection which had been forced upon him. It would have seemed\nbeforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he, with his\nunmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes, would find\nhimself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of\nwhich was repugnant to him. In his student’s chambers, he had\nprearranged his social action quite differently."

The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was\nproblematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had\nbeen generally supposed. The two physicians, for a wonder, turned out\nto be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds, they concurred\nin action. Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was, as every one had\nforeseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother. The Doctor was more than\nsuspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this\ndeficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is\nprobable that his professional weight was the more believed in, the\nworld-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still\npotent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas\nof frilling and sentiment. It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor\nwhich made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted;\nconditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of\njudgments connected with drugs. At all events, it is certain that if\nany medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having\nvery definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of\notherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general\npresumption against his medical skill."

If\nMr. Bulstrode insisted, as he was apt to do, on the Lutheran doctrine\nof justification, as that by which a Church must stand or fall, Dr.\nMinchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a\nfortuitous conjunction of atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a\nparticular providence in relation to her stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin\nfor his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to\nfixed limits; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian\nCreed, Dr. Minchin quoted Pope’s “Essay on Man.” He objected to the\nrather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring\nwell-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it was\ngenerally known that he had some kinship to a bishop, and sometimes\nspent his holidays at “the palace.”"

In short, he\nhad weight, and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw\nit; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to\ncircumvent it. They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of\nmedical reputation, and concealed with much etiquette their contempt\nfor each other’s skill. Regarding themselves as Middlemarch\ninstitutions, they were ready to combine against all innovators, and\nagainst non-professionals given to interference. On this ground they\nwere both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.\nMinchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never differed\nfrom him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found\nthat Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution. A layman who pried\ninto the professional conduct of medical men, and was always obtruding\nhis reforms,—though he was less directly embarrassing to the two\nphysicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by\ncontract, was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as\nsuch; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode,\nexcited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate. The\nlong-established practitioners, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just\nnow standing apart and having a friendly colloquy, in which they agreed\nthat Lydgate was a jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode’s purpose.\nTo non-medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other\nyoung practitioner, who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock’s\nretirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such\nargument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from\nhis having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge. It\nwas clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing drugs, intended to cast\nimputations on his equals, and also to obscure the limit between his\nown rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians, who, in\nthe interest of the profession, felt bound to maintain its various\ngrades,—especially against a man who had not been to either of the\nEnglish universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside\nstudy there, but came with a libellous pretension to experience in\nEdinburgh and Paris, where observation might be abundant indeed, but\nhardly sound."

He had not\nhimself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary, though he had a\nstrong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch, and was\nmost happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question—“any\npublic question, you know,” Mr. Brooke repeated, with his nod of\nperfect understanding. “I am a good deal occupied as a magistrate, and\nin the collection of documentary evidence, but I regard my time as\nbeing at the disposal of the public—and, in short, my friends have\nconvinced me that a chaplain with a salary—a salary, you know—is a very\ngood thing, and I am happy to be able to come here and vote for the\nappointment of Mr. Tyke, who, I understand, is an unexceptionable man,\napostolic and eloquent and everything of that kind—and I am the last\nman to withhold my vote—under the circumstances, you know.”“It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the\nquestion, Mr. Brooke,” said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of nobody,\nand was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions. “You don’t seem\nto know that one of the worthiest men we have has been doing duty as\nchaplain here for years without pay, and that Mr. Tyke is proposed to\nsupersede him.”“Excuse me, Mr. Hawley,” said Mr. Bulstrode. “Mr. Brooke has been fully\ninformed of Mr. Farebrother’s character and position.”“By his enemies,” flashed out Mr. Hawley.“I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here,” said Mr.\nThesiger.“I’ll swear there is, though,” retorted Mr. Hawley.“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in a subdued tone, “the merits of the\nquestion may be very briefly stated, and if any one present doubts that\nevery gentleman who is about to give his vote has not been fully\ninformed, I can now recapitulate the considerations that should weigh\non either side.”“I don’t see the good of that,” said Mr. Hawley. “I suppose we all know\nwhom we mean to vote for. Any man who wants to do justice does not wait\ntill the last minute to hear both sides of the question. I have no time\nto lose, and I propose that the matter be put to the vote at once.”A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote\n“Tyke” or “Farebrother” on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass\ntumbler; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter.“I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,” said Mr.\nBulstrode, in a clear biting voice. Then, looking up at Lydgate—“There is a casting-vote still to be given. It is yours, Mr. Lydgate:\nwill you be good enough to write?”“The thing is settled now,” said Mr. Wrench, rising. “We all know how\nMr. Lydgate will vote.”“You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,” said Lydgate,\nrather defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended.“I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode. Do you\nregard that meaning as offensive?”"

Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and Lydgate\ncontinued to work with Mr. Bulstrode. He was really uncertain whether\nTyke were not the more suitable candidate, and yet his consciousness\ntold him that if he had been quite free from indirect bias he should\nhave voted for Mr. Farebrother. The affair of the chaplaincy remained a\nsore point in his memory as a case in which this petty medium of\nMiddlemarch had been too strong for him. How could a man be satisfied\nwith a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances?\nNo more than he can be satisfied with his hat, which he has chosen from\namong such shapes as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it at\nbest with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison.But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. The\ncharacter of the publican and sinner is not always practically\nincompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us\nscarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the\nfaultiness of our own arguments, or the dulness of our own jokes. But\nthe Vicar of St. Botolph’s had certainly escaped the slightest tincture\nof the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too\nmuch as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in\nthis—that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him, and\ncould judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him.“The world has been too strong for _me_, I know,” he said one day to\nLydgate. “But then I am not a mighty man—I shall never be a man of\nrenown. The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but Prodicus makes it\neasy work for the hero, as if the first resolves were enough. Another\nstory says that he came to hold the distaff, and at last wore the\nNessus shirt. I suppose one good resolve might keep a man right if\neverybody else’s resolve helped him.”"

  "content": "The Vicar’s talk was not always inspiriting: he had escaped being a\nPharisee, but he had not escaped that low estimate of possibilities\nwhich we rather hastily arrive at as an inference from our own failure.\nLydgate thought that there was a pitiable infirmity of will in Mr.\nFarebrother.CHAPTER XIX.“L’ altra vedete ch’ha fatto alla guancia\nDella sua palma, sospirando, letto.”\n—_Purgatorio_, vii.When George the Fourth was still reigning over the privacies of\nWindsor, when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister, and Mr. Vincy\nwas mayor of the old corporation in Middlemarch, Mrs. Casaubon, born\nDorothea Brooke, had taken her wedding journey to Rome. In those days\nthe world in general was more ignorant of good and evil by forty years\nthan it is at present. Travellers did not often carry full information\non Christian art either in their heads or their pockets; and even the\nmost brilliant English critic of the day mistook the flower-flushed\ntomb of the ascended Virgin for an ornamental vase due to the painter’s\nfancy. Romanticism, which has helped to fill some dull blanks with love\nand knowledge, had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven and\nentered into everybody’s food; it was fermenting still as a\ndistinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German\nartists at Rome, and the youth of other nations who worked or idled\nnear them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement.One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long, but\nabundant and curly, and who was otherwise English in his equipment, had\njust turned his back on the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican and was\nlooking out on the magnificent view of the mountains from the adjoining\nround vestibule. He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice the\napproach of a dark-eyed, animated German who came up to him and placing\na hand on his shoulder, said with a strong accent, “Come here, quick!\nelse she will have changed her pose.”"

  "content": "Quickness was ready at the call, and the two figures passed lightly\nalong by the Meleager, towards the hall where the reclining Ariadne,\nthen called the Cleopatra, lies in the marble voluptuousness of her\nbeauty, the drapery folding around her with a petal-like ease and\ntenderness. They were just in time to see another figure standing\nagainst a pedestal near the reclining marble: a breathing blooming\ngirl, whose form, not shamed by the Ariadne, was clad in Quakerish gray\ndrapery; her long cloak, fastened at the neck, was thrown backward from\nher arms, and one beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her cheek, pushing\nsomewhat backward the white beaver bonnet which made a sort of halo to\nher face around the simply braided dark-brown hair. She was not looking\nat the sculpture, probably not thinking of it: her large eyes were\nfixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the floor. But\nshe became conscious of the two strangers who suddenly paused as if to\ncontemplate the Cleopatra, and, without looking at them, immediately\nturned away to join a maid-servant and courier who were loitering along\nthe hall at a little distance off.“What do you think of that for a fine bit of antithesis?” said the\nGerman, searching in his friend’s face for responding admiration, but\ngoing on volubly without waiting for any other answer. “There lies\nantique beauty, not corpse-like even in death, but arrested in the\ncomplete contentment of its sensuous perfection: and here stands beauty\nin its breathing life, with the consciousness of Christian centuries in\nits bosom. But she should be dressed as a nun; I think she looks almost\nwhat you call a Quaker; I would dress her as a nun in my picture.\nHowever, she is married; I saw her wedding-ring on that wonderful left\nhand, otherwise I should have thought the sallow _Geistlicher_ was her\nfather. I saw him parting from her a good while ago, and just now I\nfound her in that magnificent pose. Only think! he is perhaps rich, and\nwould like to have her portrait taken. Ah! it is no use looking after\nher—there she goes! Let us follow her home!”“No, no,” said his companion, with a little frown.“You are singular, Ladislaw. You look struck together. Do you know\nher?”“I know that she is married to my cousin,” said Will Ladislaw,\nsauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air, while his German\nfriend kept at his side and watched him eagerly.“What! the _Geistlicher_? He looks more like an uncle—a more useful\nsort of relation.”“He is not my uncle. I tell you he is my second cousin,” said Ladislaw,\nwith some irritation.“Schön, schön. Don’t be snappish. You are not angry with me for\nthinking Mrs. Second-Cousin the most perfect young Madonna I ever saw?”“Angry? nonsense. I have only seen her once before, for a couple of\nminutes, when my cousin introduced her to me, just before I left\nEngland. They were not married then. I didn’t know they were coming to\nRome.”“But you will go to see them now—you will find out what they have for\nan address—since you know the name. Shall we go to the post? And you\ncould speak about the portrait.”"

If you were\nan artist, you would think of Mistress Second-Cousin as antique form\nanimated by Christian sentiment—a sort of Christian Antigone—sensuous\nforce controlled by spiritual passion.”“Yes, and that your painting her was the chief outcome of her\nexistence—the divinity passing into higher completeness and all but\nexhausted in the act of covering your bit of canvas. I am amateurish if\nyou like: I do _not_ think that all the universe is straining towards\nthe obscure significance of your pictures.”“But it is, my dear!—so far as it is straining through me, Adolf\nNaumann: that stands firm,” said the good-natured painter, putting a\nhand on Ladislaw’s shoulder, and not in the least disturbed by the\nunaccountable touch of ill-humor in his tone. “See now! My existence\npresupposes the existence of the whole universe—does it _not?_ and my\nfunction is to paint—and as a painter I have a conception which is\naltogether _genialisch_, of your great-aunt or second grandmother as a\nsubject for a picture; therefore, the universe is straining towards\nthat picture through that particular hook or claw which it puts forth\nin the shape of me—not true?”“But how if another claw in the shape of me is straining to thwart\nit?—the case is a little less simple then.”“Not at all: the result of the struggle is the same thing—picture or no\npicture—logically.”Will could not resist this imperturbable temper, and the cloud in his\nface broke into sunshiny laughter.“Come now, my friend—you will help?” said Naumann, in a hopeful tone."

You\nwould only have made a better or worse portrait with a background which\nevery connoisseur would give a different reason for or against. And\nwhat is a portrait of a woman? Your painting and Plastik are poor stuff\nafter all. They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising them.\nLanguage is a finer medium.”“Yes, for those who can’t paint,” said Naumann. “There you have perfect\nright. I did not recommend you to paint, my friend.”The amiable artist carried his sting, but Ladislaw did not choose to\nappear stung. He went on as if he had not heard.“Language gives a fuller image, which is all the better for being\nvague. After all, the true seeing is within; and painting stares at you\nwith an insistent imperfection. I feel that especially about\nrepresentations of women. As if a woman were a mere colored\nsuperficies! You must wait for movement and tone. There is a difference\nin their very breathing: they change from moment to moment.—This woman\nwhom you have just seen, for example: how would you paint her voice,\npray? But her voice is much diviner than anything you have seen of\nher.”“I see, I see. You are jealous. No man must presume to think that he\ncan paint your ideal. This is serious, my friend! Your great-aunt! ‘Der\nNeffe als Onkel’ in a tragic sense—_ungeheuer!_”“You and I shall quarrel, Naumann, if you call that lady my aunt\nagain.”“How is she to be called then?”“Mrs. Casaubon.”“Good. Suppose I get acquainted with her in spite of you, and find that\nshe very much wishes to be painted?”“Yes, suppose!” said Will Ladislaw, in a contemptuous undertone,\nintended to dismiss the subject. He was conscious of being irritated by\nridiculously small causes, which were half of his own creation. Why was\nhe making any fuss about Mrs. Casaubon? And yet he felt as if something\nhad happened to him with regard to her. There are characters which are\ncontinually creating collisions and nodes for themselves in dramas\nwhich nobody is prepared to act with them. Their susceptibilities will\nclash against objects that remain innocently quiet.CHAPTER XX.“A child forsaken, waking suddenly,\nWhose gaze afeard on all things round doth rove,\nAnd seeth only that it cannot see\n    The meeting eyes of love.”"

And Mr. Casaubon\nwas certain to remain away for some time at the Vatican.Yet Dorothea had no distinctly shapen grievance that she could state\neven to herself; and in the midst of her confused thought and passion,\nthe mental act that was struggling forth into clearness was a\nself-accusing cry that her feeling of desolation was the fault of her\nown spiritual poverty. She had married the man of her choice, and with\nthe advantage over most girls that she had contemplated her marriage\nchiefly as the beginning of new duties: from the very first she had\nthought of Mr. Casaubon as having a mind so much above her own, that he\nmust often be claimed by studies which she could not entirely share;\nmoreover, after the brief narrow experience of her girlhood she was\nbeholding Rome, the city of visible history, where the past of a whole\nhemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral\nimages and trophies gathered from afar."

But let\nthem conceive one more historical contrast: the gigantic broken\nrevelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly on the\nnotions of a girl who had been brought up in English and Swiss\nPuritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories and on art chiefly of\nthe hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent nature turned all her small\nallowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her actions into their\nmould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the\nquality of a pleasure or a pain; a girl who had lately become a wife,\nand from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself\nplunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot. The weight\nof unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it\nformed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo-foreign society;\nbut Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions. Ruins and\nbasilicas, palaces and colossi, set in the midst of a sordid present,\nwhere all that was living and warm-blooded seemed sunk in the deep\ndegeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence; the dimmer but\nyet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings; the\nlong vistas of white forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold the\nmonotonous light of an alien world: all this vast wreck of ambitious\nideals, sensuous and spiritual, mixed confusedly with the signs of\nbreathing forgetfulness and degradation, at first jarred her as with an\nelectric shock, and then urged themselves on her with that ache\nbelonging to a glut of confused ideas which check the flow of emotion.\nForms both pale and glowing took possession of her young sense, and\nfixed themselves in her memory even when she was not thinking of them,\npreparing strange associations which remained through her after-years.\nOur moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other\nlike the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain states of\ndull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the vastness of\nSt. Peter’s, the huge bronze canopy, the excited intention in the\nattitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the mosaics\nabove, and the red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading\nitself everywhere like a disease of the retina."
