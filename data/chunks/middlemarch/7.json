He will be a happy fellow who gets her!”\nwas the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the Vincys; and\nthe rejected young men thought of trying again, as is the fashion in\ncountry towns where the horizon is not thick with coming rivals. But\nMrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous\npitch, for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid\naside as soon as she was married? While her aunt Bulstrode, who had a\nsisterly faithfulness towards her brother’s family, had two sincere\nwishes for Rosamond—that she might show a more serious turn of mind,\nand that she might meet with a husband whose wealth corresponded to her\nhabits.CHAPTER XVII.“The clerkly person smiled and said\nPromise was a pretty maid,\nBut being poor she died unwed.”"

  "content": "The Rev. Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next evening,\nlived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match\nthe church which it looked out upon. All the furniture too in the house\nwas old, but with another grade of age—that of Mr. Farebrother’s father\nand grandfather. There were painted white chairs, with gilding and\nwreaths on them, and some lingering red silk damask with slits in it.\nThere were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other celebrated\nlawyers of the last century; and there were old pier-glasses to reflect\nthem, as well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas resembling\na prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief against the\ndark wainscot. This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room into which\nLydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive him, who were\nalso old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine respectability: Mrs.\nFarebrother, the Vicar’s white-haired mother, befrilled and kerchiefed\nwith dainty cleanliness, upright, quick-eyed, and still under seventy;\nMiss Noble, her sister, a tiny old lady of meeker aspect, with frills\nand kerchief decidedly more worn and mended; and Miss Winifred\nFarebrother, the Vicar’s elder sister, well-looking like himself, but\nnipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who spend their lives\nin uninterrupted subjection to their elders. Lydgate had not expected\nto see so quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr. Farebrother was a\nbachelor, he had thought of being ushered into a snuggery where the\nchief furniture would probably be books and collections of natural\nobjects. The Vicar himself seemed to wear rather a changed aspect, as\nmost men do when acquaintances made elsewhere see them for the first\ntime in their own homes; some indeed showing like an actor of genial\nparts disadvantageously cast for the curmudgeon in a new piece. This\nwas not the case with Mr. Farebrother: he seemed a trifle milder and\nmore silent, the chief talker being his mother, while he only put in a\ngood-humored moderating remark here and there. The old lady was\nevidently accustomed to tell her company what they ought to think, and\nto regard no subject as quite safe without her steering. She was\nafforded leisure for this function by having all her little wants\nattended to by Miss Winifred. Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble carried on her\narm a small basket, into which she diverted a bit of sugar, which she\nhad first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake; looking round\nfurtively afterwards, and reverting to her teacup with a small innocent\nnoise as of a tiny timid quadruped. Pray think no ill of Miss Noble.\nThat basket held small savings from her more portable food, destined\nfor the children of her poor friends among whom she trotted on fine\nmornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures being so\nspontaneous a delight to her, that she regarded it much as if it had\nbeen a pleasant vice that she was addicted to. Perhaps she was\nconscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she\nmight give to those who had nothing, and carried in her conscience the\nguilt of that repressed desire. One must be poor to know the luxury of\ngiving!"

  "content": "Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and\nprecision. She presently informed him that they were not often in want\nof medical aid in that house. She had brought up her children to wear\nflannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit she considered\nthe chief reason why people needed doctors. Lydgate pleaded for those\nwhose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, but Mrs.\nFarebrother held that view of things dangerous: Nature was more just\nthan that; it would be easy for any felon to say that his ancestors\nought to have been hanged instead of him. If those who had bad fathers\nand mothers were bad themselves, they were hanged for that. There was\nno need to go back on what you couldn’t see.“My mother is like old George the Third,” said the Vicar, “she objects\nto metaphysics.”“I object to what is wrong, Camden. I say, keep hold of a few plain\ntruths, and make everything square with them. When I was young, Mr.\nLydgate, there never was any question about right and wrong. We knew\nour catechism, and that was enough; we learned our creed and our duty.\nEvery respectable Church person had the same opinions. But now, if you\nspeak out of the Prayer-book itself, you are liable to be\ncontradicted.”“That makes rather a pleasant time of it for those who like to maintain\ntheir own point,” said Lydgate.“But my mother always gives way,” said the Vicar, slyly.“No, no, Camden, you must not lead Mr. Lydgate into a mistake about\n_me_. I shall never show that disrespect to my parents, to give up what\nthey taught me. Any one may see what comes of turning. If you change\nonce, why not twenty times?”“A man might see good arguments for changing once, and not see them for\nchanging again,” said Lydgate, amused with the decisive old lady."

My father never changed, and he\npreached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man—few\nbetter. When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get\nyou a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book. That’s my opinion,\nand I think anybody’s stomach will bear me out.”“About the dinner certainly, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother.“It is the same thing, the dinner or the man. I am nearly seventy, Mr.\nLydgate, and I go upon experience. I am not likely to follow new\nlights, though there are plenty of them here as elsewhere. I say, they\ncame in with the mixed stuffs that will neither wash nor wear. It was\nnot so in my youth: a Churchman was a Churchman, and a clergyman, you\nmight be pretty sure, was a gentleman, if nothing else. But now he may\nbe no better than a Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on\npretence of doctrine. But whoever may wish to push him aside, I am\nproud to say, Mr. Lydgate, that he will compare with any preacher in\nthis kingdom, not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to\ngo by; at least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter.”“A mother is never partial,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling. “What do\nyou think Tyke’s mother says about him?”“Ah, poor creature! what indeed?” said Mrs. Farebrother, her sharpness\nblunted for the moment by her confidence in maternal judgments. “She\nsays the truth to herself, depend upon it.”“And what is the truth?” said Lydgate. “I am curious to know.”“Oh, nothing bad at all,” said Mr. Farebrother. “He is a zealous\nfellow: not very learned, and not very wise, I think—because I don’t\nagree with him.”“Why, Camden!” said Miss Winifred, “Griffin and his wife told me only\nto-day, that Mr. Tyke said they should have no more coals if they came\nto hear you preach.”Mrs. Farebrother laid down her knitting, which she had resumed after\nher small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at her son as if to\nsay “You hear that?” Miss Noble said, “Oh poor things! poor things!” in\nreference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal. But the\nVicar answered quietly—“That is because they are not my parishioners. And I don’t think my\nsermons are worth a load of coals to them.”"

  "content": "“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who could not let this pass, “you\ndon’t know my son: he always undervalues himself. I tell him he is\nundervaluing the God who made him, and made him a most excellent\npreacher.”“That must be a hint for me to take Mr. Lydgate away to my study,\nmother,” said the Vicar, laughing. “I promised to show you my\ncollection,” he added, turning to Lydgate; “shall we go?”All three ladies remonstrated. Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried away\nwithout being allowed to accept another cup of tea: Miss Winifred had\nabundance of good tea in the pot. Why was Camden in such haste to take\na visitor to his den? There was nothing but pickled vermin, and drawers\nfull of blue-bottles and moths, with no carpet on the floor. Mr.\nLydgate must excuse it. A game at cribbage would be far better. In\nshort, it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his womankind as\nthe king of men and preachers, and yet be held by them to stand in much\nneed of their direction. Lydgate, with the usual shallowness of a young\nbachelor, wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught them better.“My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any interest\nin my hobbies,” said the Vicar, as he opened the door of his study,\nwhich was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had\nimplied, unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box were to be\nexcepted.“Men of your profession don’t generally smoke,” he said. Lydgate smiled\nand shook his head. “Nor of mine either, properly, I suppose. You will\nhear that pipe alleged against me by Bulstrode and Company. They don’t\nknow how pleased the devil would be if I gave it up.”“I understand. You are of an excitable temper and want a sedative. I am\nheavier, and should get idle with it. I should rush into idleness, and\nstagnate there with all my might.”"

See,” continued the Vicar,\nopening several small drawers, “I fancy I have made an exhaustive study\nof the entomology of this district. I am going on both with the fauna\nand flora; but I have at least done my insects well. We are singularly\nrich in orthoptera: I don’t know whether—Ah! you have got hold of that\nglass jar—you are looking into that instead of my drawers. You don’t\nreally care about these things?”“Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster. I have never had\ntime to give myself much to natural history. I was early bitten with an\ninterest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my\nprofession. I have no hobby besides. I have the sea to swim in there.”“Ah! you are a happy fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, turning on his heel\nand beginning to fill his pipe. “You don’t know what it is to want\nspiritual tobacco—bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a\nvariety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known signature of\nPhilomicron, for the ‘Twaddler’s Magazine;’ or a learned treatise on\nthe entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not\nmentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites in their passage\nthrough the desert; with a monograph on the Ant, as treated by Solomon,\nshowing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern\nresearch. You don’t mind my fumigating you?”Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its\nimplied meaning—that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the right\nvocation. The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the bookcase\nfilled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History, made him\nthink again of the winnings at cards and their destination. But he was\nbeginning to wish that the very best construction of everything that\nMr. Farebrother did should be the true one. The Vicar’s frankness\nseemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy\nconsciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but simply\nthe relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible.\nApparently he was not without a sense that his freedom of speech might\nseem premature, for he presently said—"

  "content": "“I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr. Lydgate,\nand know you better than you know me. You remember Trawley who shared\nyour apartment at Paris for some time? I was a correspondent of his,\nand he told me a good deal about you. I was not quite sure when you\nfirst came that you were the same man. I was very glad when I found\nthat you were. Only I don’t forget that you have not had the like\nprologue about me.”Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here, but did not half\nunderstand it. “By the way,” he said, “what has become of Trawley? I\nhave quite lost sight of him. He was hot on the French social systems,\nand talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of Pythagorean\ncommunity. Is he gone?”“Not at all. He is practising at a German bath, and has married a rich\npatient.”“Then my notions wear the best, so far,” said Lydgate, with a short\nscornful laugh. “He would have it, the medical profession was an\ninevitable system of humbug. I said, the fault was in the men—men who\ntruckle to lies and folly. Instead of preaching against humbug outside\nthe walls, it might be better to set up a disinfecting apparatus\nwithin. In short—I am reporting my own conversation—you may be sure I\nhad all the good sense on my side.”“Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the\nPythagorean community, though. You have not only got the old Adam in\nyourself against you, but you have got all those descendants of the\noriginal Adam who form the society around you. You see, I have paid\ntwelve or thirteen years more than you for my knowledge of\ndifficulties. But”—Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment, and then added,\n“you are eying that glass vase again. Do you want to make an exchange?\nYou shall not have it without a fair barter.”“I have some sea-mice—fine specimens—in spirits. And I will throw in\nRobert Brown’s new thing—‘Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of\nPlants’—if you don’t happen to have it already.”"

You must learn to be bored, remember. However, you shall\nhave the monster on your own terms.”“Don’t you think men overrate the necessity for humoring everybody’s\nnonsense, till they get despised by the very fools they humor?” said\nLydgate, moving to Mr. Farebrother’s side, and looking rather absently\nat the insects ranged in fine gradation, with names subscribed in\nexquisite writing. “The shortest way is to make your value felt, so\nthat people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.”“With all my heart. But then you must be sure of having the value, and\nyou must keep yourself independent. Very few men can do that. Either\nyou slip out of service altogether, and become good for nothing, or you\nwear the harness and draw a good deal where your yoke-fellows pull you.\nBut do look at these delicate orthoptera!”Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the Vicar\nlaughing at himself, and yet persisting in the exhibition.“Apropos of what you said about wearing harness,” Lydgate began, after\nthey had sat down, “I made up my mind some time ago to do with as\nlittle of it as possible. That was why I determined not to try anything\nin London, for a good many years at least. I didn’t like what I saw\nwhen I was studying there—so much empty bigwiggism, and obstructive\ntrickery. In the country, people have less pretension to knowledge, and\nare less of companions, but for that reason they affect one’s\namour-propre less: one makes less bad blood, and can follow one’s own\ncourse more quietly.”“Yes—well—you have got a good start; you are in the right profession,\nthe work you feel yourself most fit for. Some people miss that, and\nrepent too late. But you must not be too sure of keeping your\nindependence.”“You mean of family ties?” said Lydgate, conceiving that these might\npress rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother."

There’s a parishioner of mine—a fine fellow, but who\nwould hardly have pulled through as he has done without his wife. Do\nyou know the Garths? I think they were not Peacock’s patients.”“No; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone’s, at Lowick.”“Their daughter: an excellent girl.”“She is very quiet—I have hardly noticed her.”“She has taken notice of you, though, depend upon it.”“I don’t understand,” said Lydgate; he could hardly say “Of course.”“Oh, she gauges everybody. I prepared her for confirmation—she is a\nfavorite of mine.”Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence, Lydgate not caring to\nknow more about the Garths. At last the Vicar laid down his pipe,\nstretched out his legs, and turned his bright eyes with a smile towards\nLydgate, saying—“But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take us to be. We have\nour intrigues and our parties. I am a party man, for example, and\nBulstrode is another. If you vote for me you will offend Bulstrode.”“What is there against Bulstrode?” said Lydgate, emphatically.“I did not say there was anything against him except that. If you vote\nagainst him you will make him your enemy.”“I don’t know that I need mind about that,” said Lydgate, rather\nproudly; “but he seems to have good ideas about hospitals, and he\nspends large sums on useful public objects. He might help me a good\ndeal in carrying out my ideas. As to his religious notions—why, as\nVoltaire said, incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if\nadministered with a certain quantity of arsenic. I look for the man who\nwill bring the arsenic, and don’t mind about his incantations.”"

  "content": "“Very good. But then you must not offend your arsenic-man. You will not\noffend me, you know,” said Mr. Farebrother, quite unaffectedly. “I\ndon’t translate my own convenience into other people’s duties. I am\nopposed to Bulstrode in many ways. I don’t like the set he belongs to:\nthey are a narrow ignorant set, and do more to make their neighbors\nuncomfortable than to make them better. Their system is a sort of\nworldly-spiritual cliqueism: they really look on the rest of mankind as\na doomed carcass which is to nourish them for heaven. But,” he added,\nsmilingly, “I don’t say that Bulstrode’s new hospital is a bad thing;\nand as to his wanting to oust me from the old one—why, if he thinks me\na mischievous fellow, he is only returning a compliment. And I am not a\nmodel clergyman—only a decent makeshift.”Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself. A model\nclergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think his own profession the\nfinest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his\nmoral pathology and therapeutics. He only said, “What reason does\nBulstrode give for superseding you?”“That I don’t teach his opinions—which he calls spiritual religion; and\nthat I have no time to spare. Both statements are true. But then I\ncould make time, and I should be glad of the forty pounds. That is the\nplain fact of the case. But let us dismiss it. I only wanted to tell\nyou that if you vote for your arsenic-man, you are not to cut me in\nconsequence. I can’t spare you. You are a sort of circumnavigator come\nto settle among us, and will keep up my belief in the antipodes. Now\ntell me all about them in Paris.”CHAPTER XVIII.“Oh, sir, the loftiest hopes on earth\nDraw lots with meaner hopes: heroic breasts,\nBreathing bad air, run risk of pestilence;\nOr, lacking lime-juice when they cross the Line,\nMay languish with the scurvy.”Some weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the\nchaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate, and without\ntelling himself the reason, he deferred the predetermination on which\nside he should give his vote. It would really have been a matter of\ntotal indifference to him—that is to say, he would have taken the more\nconvenient side, and given his vote for the appointment of Tyke without\nany hesitation—if he had not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother."

That, entering into Lydgate’s position as a new-comer\nwho had his own professional objects to secure, Mr. Farebrother should\nhave taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain his interest, showed\nan unusual delicacy and generosity, which Lydgate’s nature was keenly\nalive to. It went along with other points of conduct in Mr. Farebrother\nwhich were exceptionally fine, and made his character resemble those\nsouthern landscapes which seem divided between natural grandeur and\nsocial slovenliness. Very few men could have been as filial and\nchivalrous as he was to the mother, aunt, and sister, whose dependence\non him had in many ways shaped his life rather uneasily for himself;\nfew men who feel the pressure of small needs are so nobly resolute not\nto dress up their inevitably self-interested desires in a pretext of\nbetter motives. In these matters he was conscious that his life would\nbear the closest scrutiny; and perhaps the consciousness encouraged a\nlittle defiance towards the critical strictness of persons whose\ncelestial intimacies seemed not to improve their domestic manners, and\nwhose lofty aims were not needed to account for their actions. Then,\nhis preaching was ingenious and pithy, like the preaching of the\nEnglish Church in its robust age, and his sermons were delivered\nwithout book. People outside his parish went to hear him; and, since to\nfill the church was always the most difficult part of a clergyman’s\nfunction, here was another ground for a careless sense of superiority.\nBesides, he was a likable man: sweet-tempered, ready-witted, frank,\nwithout grins of suppressed bitterness or other conversational flavors\nwhich make half of us an affliction to our friends. Lydgate liked him\nheartily, and wished for his friendship."

  "content": "With this feeling uppermost, he continued to waive the question of the\nchaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper\nbusiness of his, but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for\nhis vote. Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode’s request, was laying down plans\nfor the internal arrangements of the new hospital, and the two were\noften in consultation. The banker was always presupposing that he could\ncount in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made no special\nrecurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When\nthe General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had\nnotice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of\nthe directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had\na vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch\nbusiness. He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration\nthat Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair was a\nquestion of office or no office; and he could not help an equally\npronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office. For his\nobservation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother’s assurance that\nthe banker would not overlook opposition. “Confound their petty\npolitics!” was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative\nprocess of shaving, when he had begun to feel that he must really hold\na court of conscience on this matter. Certainly there were valid things\nto be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother: he had too much on\nhis hands already, especially considering how much time he spent on\nnon-clerical occupations. Then again it was a continually repeated\nshock, disturbing Lydgate’s esteem, that the Vicar should obviously\nplay for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently\nliking some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended on theory\nfor the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen’s wit was\nstagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have\nplayed very much less but for the money. There was a billiard-room at\nthe Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and wives regarded as the\nchief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar was a first-rate\nbilliard-player, and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon, there\nwere reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had\nwon money. And as to the chaplaincy, he did not pretend that he cared\nfor it, except for the sake of the forty pounds. Lydgate was no\nPuritan, but he did not care for play, and winning money at it had\nalways seemed a meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of life which\nmade this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums\nthoroughly hateful to him. Hitherto in his own life his wants had been\nsupplied without any trouble to himself, and his first impulse was\nalways to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a\ngentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting\nhalf-crowns. He had always known in a general way that he was not rich,\nbut he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part\nwhich the want of money plays in determining the actions of men. Money\nhad never been a motive to him. Hence he was not ready to frame excuses\nfor this deliberate pursuit of small gains. It was altogether repulsive\nto him, and he never entered into any calculation of the ratio between\nthe Vicar’s income and his more or less necessary expenditure. It was\npossible that he would not have made such a calculation in his own\ncase."

One\nwould know much better what to do if men’s characters were more\nconsistent, and especially if one’s friends were invariably fit for any\nfunction they desired to undertake! Lydgate was convinced that if there\nhad been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother, he would have voted for\nhim, whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject: he did not\nintend to be a vassal of Bulstrode’s. On the other hand, there was\nTyke, a man entirely given to his clerical office, who was simply\ncurate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter’s parish, and had time for\nextra duty. Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that\nthey could not bear him, and suspected him of cant. Really, from his\npoint of view, Bulstrode was thoroughly justified."

Other people would say so,\nand would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake\nof making himself important and getting on in the world. What then? He\nfor his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been\nconcerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s\nfriendship or enmity. What he really cared for was a medium for his\nwork, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound to\nprefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could\ndemonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic\nresults, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For the\nfirst time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of\nsmall social conditions, and their frustrating complexity. At the end\nof his inward debate, when he set out for the hospital, his hope was\nreally in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to\nthe question, and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for\nvoting. I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is\nbegotten by circumstances—some feeling rushing warmly and making\nresolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more\ndifficult. However it was, he did not distinctly say to himself on\nwhich side he would vote; and all the while he was inwardly resenting\nthe subjection which had been forced upon him. It would have seemed\nbeforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he, with his\nunmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes, would find\nhimself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of\nwhich was repugnant to him. In his student’s chambers, he had\nprearranged his social action quite differently."

The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was\nproblematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had\nbeen generally supposed. The two physicians, for a wonder, turned out\nto be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds, they concurred\nin action. Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was, as every one had\nforeseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother. The Doctor was more than\nsuspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this\ndeficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is\nprobable that his professional weight was the more believed in, the\nworld-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still\npotent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas\nof frilling and sentiment. It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor\nwhich made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted;\nconditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of\njudgments connected with drugs. At all events, it is certain that if\nany medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having\nvery definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of\notherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general\npresumption against his medical skill."

If\nMr. Bulstrode insisted, as he was apt to do, on the Lutheran doctrine\nof justification, as that by which a Church must stand or fall, Dr.\nMinchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a\nfortuitous conjunction of atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a\nparticular providence in relation to her stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin\nfor his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to\nfixed limits; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian\nCreed, Dr. Minchin quoted Pope’s “Essay on Man.” He objected to the\nrather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring\nwell-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it was\ngenerally known that he had some kinship to a bishop, and sometimes\nspent his holidays at “the palace.”"

In short, he\nhad weight, and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw\nit; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to\ncircumvent it. They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of\nmedical reputation, and concealed with much etiquette their contempt\nfor each other’s skill. Regarding themselves as Middlemarch\ninstitutions, they were ready to combine against all innovators, and\nagainst non-professionals given to interference. On this ground they\nwere both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.\nMinchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never differed\nfrom him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found\nthat Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution. A layman who pried\ninto the professional conduct of medical men, and was always obtruding\nhis reforms,—though he was less directly embarrassing to the two\nphysicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by\ncontract, was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as\nsuch; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode,\nexcited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate. The\nlong-established practitioners, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just\nnow standing apart and having a friendly colloquy, in which they agreed\nthat Lydgate was a jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode’s purpose.\nTo non-medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other\nyoung practitioner, who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock’s\nretirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such\nargument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from\nhis having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge. It\nwas clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing drugs, intended to cast\nimputations on his equals, and also to obscure the limit between his\nown rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians, who, in\nthe interest of the profession, felt bound to maintain its various\ngrades,—especially against a man who had not been to either of the\nEnglish universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside\nstudy there, but came with a libellous pretension to experience in\nEdinburgh and Paris, where observation might be abundant indeed, but\nhardly sound."

A salary, with all my heart. But why\ntake it from the Vicar? He has none too much—has to insure his life,\nbesides keeping house, and doing a vicar’s charities. Put forty pounds\nin his pocket and you’ll do no harm. He’s a good fellow, is\nFarebrother, with as little of the parson about him as will serve to\ncarry orders.”“Ho, ho! Doctor,” said old Mr. Powderell, a retired iron-monger of some\nstanding—his interjection being something between a laugh and a\nParliamentary disapproval; “we must let you have your say. But what we\nhave to consider is not anybody’s income—it’s the souls of the poor\nsick people”—here Mr. Powderell’s voice and face had a sincere pathos\nin them. “He is a real Gospel preacher, is Mr. Tyke.

Will any member of the committee aver that he would have\nentertained the idea of displacing the gentleman who has always\ndischarged the function of chaplain here, if it had not been suggested\nto him by parties whose disposition it is to regard every institution\nof this town as a machinery for carrying out their own views? I tax no\nman’s motives: let them lie between himself and a higher Power; but I\ndo say, that there are influences at work here which are incompatible\nwith genuine independence, and that a crawling servility is usually\ndictated by circumstances which gentlemen so conducting themselves\ncould not afford either morally or financially to avow. I myself am a\nlayman, but I have given no inconsiderable attention to the divisions\nin the Church and—”“Oh, damn the divisions!” burst in Mr. Frank Hawley, lawyer and\ntown-clerk, who rarely presented himself at the board, but now looked\nin hurriedly, whip in hand. “We have nothing to do with them here.\nFarebrother has been doing the work—what there was—without pay, and if\npay is to be given, it should be given to him. I call it a confounded\njob to take the thing away from Farebrother.”“I think it would be as well for gentlemen not to give their remarks a\npersonal bearing,” said Mr. Plymdale. “I shall vote for the appointment\nof Mr. Tyke, but I should not have known, if Mr. Hackbutt hadn’t hinted\nit, that I was a Servile Crawler.”“I disclaim any personalities. I expressly said, if I may be allowed to\nrepeat, or even to conclude what I was about to say—”“Ah, here’s Minchin!” said Mr. Frank Hawley; at which everybody turned\naway from Mr. Hackbutt, leaving him to feel the uselessness of superior\ngifts in Middlemarch. “Come, Doctor, I must have you on the right side,\neh?”“I hope so,” said Dr. Minchin, nodding and shaking hands here and\nthere; “at whatever cost to my feelings.”“If there’s any feeling here, it should be feeling for the man who is\nturned out, I think,” said Mr. Frank Hawley.“I confess I have feelings on the other side also. I have a divided\nesteem,” said Dr. Minchin, rubbing his hands. “I consider Mr. Tyke an\nexemplary man—none more so—and I believe him to be proposed from\nunimpeachable motives. I, for my part, wish that I could give him my\nvote. But I am constrained to take a view of the case which gives the\npreponderance to Mr. Farebrother’s claims.

In\nmy opinion Farebrother is too lax for a clergyman. I don’t wish to\nbring up particulars against him; but he will make a little attendance\nhere go as far as he can.”“And a devilish deal better than too much,” said Mr. Hawley, whose bad\nlanguage was notorious in that part of the county. “Sick people can’t\nbear so much praying and preaching. And that methodistical sort of\nreligion is bad for the spirits—bad for the inside, eh?” he added,\nturning quickly round to the four medical men who were assembled.But any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three gentlemen,\nwith whom there were greetings more or less cordial. These were the\nReverend Edward Thesiger, Rector of St. Peter’s, Mr. Bulstrode, and our\nfriend Mr. Brooke of Tipton, who had lately allowed himself to be put\non the board of directors in his turn, but had never before attended,\nhis attendance now being due to Mr. Bulstrode’s exertions. Lydgate was\nthe only person still expected.Every one now sat down, Mr. Bulstrode presiding, pale and\nself-restrained as usual. Mr. Thesiger, a moderate evangelical, wished\nfor the appointment of his friend Mr. Tyke, a zealous able man, who,\nofficiating at a chapel of ease, had not a cure of souls too extensive\nto leave him ample time for the new duty. It was desirable that\nchaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a fervent\nintention: they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual influence;\nand while it was good that a salary should be allotted, there was the\nmore need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted\ninto a mere question of salary. Mr. Thesiger’s manner had so much quiet\npropriety that objectors could only simmer in silence."

He had not\nhimself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary, though he had a\nstrong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch, and was\nmost happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question—“any\npublic question, you know,” Mr. Brooke repeated, with his nod of\nperfect understanding. “I am a good deal occupied as a magistrate, and\nin the collection of documentary evidence, but I regard my time as\nbeing at the disposal of the public—and, in short, my friends have\nconvinced me that a chaplain with a salary—a salary, you know—is a very\ngood thing, and I am happy to be able to come here and vote for the\nappointment of Mr. Tyke, who, I understand, is an unexceptionable man,\napostolic and eloquent and everything of that kind—and I am the last\nman to withhold my vote—under the circumstances, you know.”“It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the\nquestion, Mr. Brooke,” said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of nobody,\nand was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions. “You don’t seem\nto know that one of the worthiest men we have has been doing duty as\nchaplain here for years without pay, and that Mr. Tyke is proposed to\nsupersede him.”“Excuse me, Mr. Hawley,” said Mr. Bulstrode. “Mr. Brooke has been fully\ninformed of Mr. Farebrother’s character and position.”“By his enemies,” flashed out Mr. Hawley.“I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here,” said Mr.\nThesiger.“I’ll swear there is, though,” retorted Mr. Hawley.“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in a subdued tone, “the merits of the\nquestion may be very briefly stated, and if any one present doubts that\nevery gentleman who is about to give his vote has not been fully\ninformed, I can now recapitulate the considerations that should weigh\non either side.”“I don’t see the good of that,” said Mr. Hawley. “I suppose we all know\nwhom we mean to vote for. Any man who wants to do justice does not wait\ntill the last minute to hear both sides of the question. I have no time\nto lose, and I propose that the matter be put to the vote at once.”A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote\n“Tyke” or “Farebrother” on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass\ntumbler; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter.“I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,” said Mr.\nBulstrode, in a clear biting voice. Then, looking up at Lydgate—“There is a casting-vote still to be given. It is yours, Mr. Lydgate:\nwill you be good enough to write?”“The thing is settled now,” said Mr. Wrench, rising. “We all know how\nMr. Lydgate will vote.”“You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,” said Lydgate,\nrather defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended.“I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode. Do you\nregard that meaning as offensive?”"

  "content": "“It may be offensive to others. But I shall not desist from voting with\nhim on that account.” Lydgate immediately wrote down “Tyke.”So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and Lydgate\ncontinued to work with Mr. Bulstrode. He was really uncertain whether\nTyke were not the more suitable candidate, and yet his consciousness\ntold him that if he had been quite free from indirect bias he should\nhave voted for Mr. Farebrother. The affair of the chaplaincy remained a\nsore point in his memory as a case in which this petty medium of\nMiddlemarch had been too strong for him. How could a man be satisfied\nwith a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances?\nNo more than he can be satisfied with his hat, which he has chosen from\namong such shapes as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it at\nbest with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison.But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. The\ncharacter of the publican and sinner is not always practically\nincompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us\nscarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the\nfaultiness of our own arguments, or the dulness of our own jokes. But\nthe Vicar of St. Botolph’s had certainly escaped the slightest tincture\nof the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too\nmuch as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in\nthis—that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him, and\ncould judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him.“The world has been too strong for _me_, I know,” he said one day to\nLydgate. “But then I am not a mighty man—I shall never be a man of\nrenown. The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but Prodicus makes it\neasy work for the hero, as if the first resolves were enough. Another\nstory says that he came to hold the distaff, and at last wore the\nNessus shirt. I suppose one good resolve might keep a man right if\neverybody else’s resolve helped him.”"

In those days\nthe world in general was more ignorant of good and evil by forty years\nthan it is at present. Travellers did not often carry full information\non Christian art either in their heads or their pockets; and even the\nmost brilliant English critic of the day mistook the flower-flushed\ntomb of the ascended Virgin for an ornamental vase due to the painter’s\nfancy. Romanticism, which has helped to fill some dull blanks with love\nand knowledge, had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven and\nentered into everybody’s food; it was fermenting still as a\ndistinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German\nartists at Rome, and the youth of other nations who worked or idled\nnear them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement.One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long, but\nabundant and curly, and who was otherwise English in his equipment, had\njust turned his back on the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican and was\nlooking out on the magnificent view of the mountains from the adjoining\nround vestibule. He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice the\napproach of a dark-eyed, animated German who came up to him and placing\na hand on his shoulder, said with a strong accent, “Come here, quick!\nelse she will have changed her pose.”"
