  "content": "﻿PRELUDE.Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious\nmixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt,\nat least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with\nsome gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one\nmorning hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek\nmartyrdom in the country of the Moors? Out they toddled from rugged\nAvila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human\nhearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met\nthem in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great\nresolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa’s\npassionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed\nromances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to\nher? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within,\nsoared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would\nnever justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the\nrapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the\nreform of a religious order."

  "content": "That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not\nthe last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born who found for\nthemselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of\nfar-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of\na certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of\nopportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and\nsank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance\nthey tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but\nafter all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and\nformlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent\nsocial faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge\nfor the ardently willing soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague\nideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was\ndisapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient\nindefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures\nof women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as\nthe ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might\nbe treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness\nremains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one\nwould imagine from the sameness of women’s coiffure and the favorite\nlove-stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared\nuneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the\nliving stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here and\nthere is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving\nheart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are\ndispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some\nlong-recognizable deed.BOOK I.\nMISS BROOKE.CHAPTER I.Since I can do no good because a woman,\nReach constantly at something that is near it.\n                    —_The Maid’s Tragedy:_ BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER."

  "content": "Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into\nrelief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she\ncould wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the\nBlessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as\nher stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain\ngarments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the\nimpressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our\nelder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper. She was usually\nspoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her\nsister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely\nmore trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress\ndiffered from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its\narrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed\nconditions, in most of which her sister shared. The pride of being\nladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not\nexactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired\nbackward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring\nor parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a\nclergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan\ngentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and\nmanaged to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a\nrespectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet\ncountry-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a\nparlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s\ndaughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made\nshow in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was\nrequired for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have\nbeen enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious\nfeeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have\ndetermined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s\nsentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to\naccept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea\nknew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;\nand to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,\nmade the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for\nBedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life\ninvolving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and\nartificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned\nby its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might\nfrankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there;\nshe was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing\nwhatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,\nto make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a\nquarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such elements in the\ncharacter of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and\nhinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,\nvanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she, the elder of\nthe sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since\nthey were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans\nat once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and\nafterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and\nguardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their\norphaned condition."

  "content": "It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with\ntheir uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous\nopinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years,\nand was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too\nrambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to\npredict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with\nbenevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as\npossible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite\nminds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax\nabout all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,\nconcerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in\nabeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and\nvirtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his\nway of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the\nmore for the time when she would be of age and have some command of\nmoney for generous schemes. She was regarded as an heiress; for not\nonly had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but\nif Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s\nestate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which\nseemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late\nconduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and\nof that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities\nof genteel life."

  "content": "And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such\nprospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her\ninsistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a\nwary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead\nher at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and\nfortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick\nlaborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the\ntime of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,\nand of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife\nmight awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the\napplication of her income which would interfere with political economy\nand the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice\nbefore he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to\nhave weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic\nlife was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their\nneighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know\nand avoid them.The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,\nwas generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and\ninnocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her\nreligion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her,\nthe innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much\nsubtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of\nblazonry or clock-face for it.Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by\nthis alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably\nreconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on\nhorseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the\ncountry, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she\nlooked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she\nallowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she\nenjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to\nrenouncing it."

  "content": "She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it\nwas pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with\nattractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman\nappeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of\nseeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:\nSir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from\nCelia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for\nCelia to accept him. That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself\nwould have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all\nher eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas\nabout marriage. She felt sure that she would have accepted the\njudicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that\nwretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his\nblindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits\nit would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome\nbaronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed\nuncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover? The really delightful\nmarriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and\ncould teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.These peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all\nthe more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some\nmiddle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces. But he himself\ndreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for\nsuch a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s\nobjections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is\nto say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of\ngentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So\nMiss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all\ndislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another\ngentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt\nsome venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,\nnoted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many\nyears to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also\nas a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views\nof his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication\nof his book. His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be\nmeasured without a precise chronology of scholarship.Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she\nhad set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the\npretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on\nfinishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted\nin), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to\npropose something, said—“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we\nlooked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly six\nmonths to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at\nthem yet.”"

  "content": "Celia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full\npresence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and\nprinciple; two associated facts which might show a mysterious\nelectricity if you touched them incautiously. To her relief, Dorothea’s\neyes were full of laughter as she looked up.“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or\nsix lunar months?”“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April\nwhen uncle gave them to you. You know, he said that he had forgotten\nthem till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you\nlocked them up in the cabinet here.”“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a\nfull cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She had her pencil\nin her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.Celia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are wanting in\nrespect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.\nAnd,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of\nmortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who\nwas stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.\nAnd Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore\njewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really\napplied herself to argument.“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished\ndiscovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she\nhad caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. “Of\ncourse, then, let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before? But\nthe keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her\nhead and seemed to despair of her memory.“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long\nmeditated and prearranged.“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”"

  "content": "The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread\nout, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection,\nbut a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest\nthat was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in\nexquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.\nDorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her\nsister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the\ncircle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and\nshe could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.“There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this\ncross you must wear with your dark dresses.”Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must keep the\ncross yourself.”“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless\ndeprecation.“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,”\nsaid Celia, insistingly. “You _might_ wear that.”“Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I\nwould wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek. “Souls have\ncomplexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so\nfond of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need\ndiscuss them no longer. There—take away your property.”Celia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority\nin this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of\nan unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will\nnever wear them?”“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to\nkeep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I\nshould feel as if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round with\nme, and I should not know how to walk.”Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be a\nlittle tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit\nyou better,” she said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness\nof the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia\nhappier in taking it. She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed\na fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a\ncloud sent a bright gleam over the table."

  "content": "“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current\nof feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how deeply colors\nseem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why\ngems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They\nlook like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful\nthan any of them.”“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not notice\nthis at first.”“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her\nfinely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on\na level with her eyes. All the while her thought was trying to justify\nher delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.“You _would_ like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,\nbeginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness,\nand also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than\npurple amethysts. “You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing\nelse. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”“Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea. Then,\nletting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what\nmiserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She\npaused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce\nthe ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But take all\nthe rest away, and the casket.”She took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking\nat them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at\nthese little fountains of pure color.“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with\nreal curiosity as to what she would do.Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative\nadornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen\ndiscernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke\never attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward\nfire.“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily. “I cannot tell to what level I\nmay sink.”"

Dorothea\ntoo was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing, questioning the\npurity of her own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with\nthat little explosion.Celia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the\nwrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked\nthat question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was\ninconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the\njewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them\naltogether.“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a\nnecklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I\nshould be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society,\nthough of course she herself ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea is\nnot always consistent.”Thus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her\nsister calling her.“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great\narchitect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.”As Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her\nsister’s arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw\nthat she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her. Since they\ncould remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the\nattitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister. The younger had\nalways worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private\nopinions?CHAPTER II.“‘Dime; no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene sobre un\ncaballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?’ ‘Lo\nque veo y columbro,’ respondio Sancho, ‘no es sino un hombre sobre un\nas no pardo como el mio, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que\nrelumbra.’ ‘Pues ese es el yelmo de Mambrino,’ dijo Don\nQuijote.”—CERVANTES.“‘Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray\nsteed, and weareth a golden helmet?’ ‘What I see,’ answered Sancho, ‘is\nnothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something\nshiny on his head.’ ‘Just so,’ answered Don Quixote: ‘and that\nresplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.’”"

  "content": "“Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling\nway, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s\nAgricultural Chemistry. “Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him\nyears ago at Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet\nWordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at\nCambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him—and I dined\nwith him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s. There’s an oddity in\nthings, now. But Davy was there: he was a poet too. Or, as I may say,\nWordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in every\nsense, you know.”Dorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of\ndinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the\nmass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably. She wondered how a man\nlike Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. His manners, she\nthought, were very dignified; the set of his iron-gray hair and his\ndeep eye-sockets made him resemble the portrait of Locke. He had the\nspare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different\nas possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type\nrepresented by Sir James Chettam.“I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,\n“because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see\nif something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among\nmy tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into\nelectrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of\nyour cow-house. It won’t do. I went into science a great deal myself at\none time; but I saw it would not do. It leads to everything; you can\nlet nothing alone. No, no—see that your tenants don’t sell their straw,\nand that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know. But\nyour fancy farming will not do—the most expensive sort of whistle you\ncan buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.”“Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out\nhow men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in\nkeeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make\nyourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.”She spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir\nJames had appealed to her. He was accustomed to do so, and she had\noften thought that she could urge him to many good actions when he was\nher brother-in-law.Mr. Casaubon turned his eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she was\nspeaking, and seemed to observe her newly."

I took in all the new ideas\nat one time—human perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in\ncircles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it myself. The\nfact is, human reason may carry you a little too far—over the hedge, in\nfact. It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do.\nI pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I have always been\nin favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be\nlanded back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is Southey’s\n‘Peninsular War.’ I am reading that of a morning. You know Southey?”“No,” said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke’s impetuous\nreason, and thinking of the book only. “I have little leisure for such\nliterature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters\nlately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am\nfastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect\nreader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the\ninward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something\nlike the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying\nmentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and\nconfusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution\nabout my eyesight.”This was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He\ndelivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make\na public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,\noccasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more\nconspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy\nslovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most\ninteresting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,\nthe Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the\nWaldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the\nhighest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any way present at, to\nassist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted\nher above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of\npolitical economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an\nextinguisher over all her lights."

I shall not\nride any more,” said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a\nlittle annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when\nshe wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.“No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that\nshowed strong interest. “Your sister is given to self-mortification, is\nshe not?” he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.“I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say\nsomething that would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as\npossible above her necklace. “She likes giving up.”“If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not\nself-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to\ndo what is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.Mr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.\nCasaubon was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.“Exactly,” said Sir James. “You give up from some high, generous\nmotive.”“No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,” answered\nDorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from\nhigh delight or anger. At this moment she felt angry with the perverse\nSir James. Why did he not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to\nlisten to Mr. Casaubon?—if that learned man would only talk, instead of\nallowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then\ninforming him that the Reformation either meant something or it did\nnot, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism\nwas a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist\nchapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly\nspeaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.“I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if\nto explain the insight just manifested. “I know something of all\nschools. I knew Wilberforce in his best days. Do you know Wilberforce?”Mr. Casaubon said, “No.”"

I\nbegan a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but\nwhen a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an\nanswer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your\ndocuments?”“In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air\nof effort.“Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but\neverything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is\nin A or Z.”“I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said\nDorothea. “I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects\nunder each letter.”Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have\nan excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies\nmeddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”Dorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some\nspecial reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in\nhis mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other\nfragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_.When the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—“How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”“Celia! He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. He\nis remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He has the same deep\neye-sockets.”“Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”“Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at him,” said\nDorothea, walking away a little.“Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.”“All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a\n_cochon de lait_.”“Dodo!” exclaimed Celia, looking after her in surprise. “I never heard\nyou make such a comparison before.”“Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good\ncomparison: the match is perfect.”"

She\nhad never been deceived as to the object of the baronet’s interest.\nSometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a\nhusband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in\nthe depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too\nreligious for family comfort.

  "content": "When Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by\nher, not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive. Why\nshould he? He thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him, and\nmanners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted\nby preconceptions either confident or distrustful. She was thoroughly\ncharming to him, but of course he theorized a little about his\nattachment. He was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare\nmerit of knowing that his talents, even if let loose, would not set the\nsmallest stream in the county on fire: hence he liked the prospect of a\nwife to whom he could say, “What shall we do?” about this or that; who\ncould help her husband out with reasons, and would also have the\nproperty qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness\nalleged against Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it\nconsisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In\nshort, he felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready\nto endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could\nalways put down when he liked. Sir James had no idea that he should\never like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl, in whose\ncleverness he delighted. Why not? A man’s mind—what there is of it—has\nalways the advantage of being masculine,—as the smallest birch-tree is\nof a higher kind than the most soaring palm,—and even his ignorance is\nof a sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this\nestimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with\na little gum or starch in the form of tradition.“Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse,\nMiss Brooke,” said the persevering admirer. “I assure you, riding is\nthe most healthy of exercises.”“I am aware of it,” said Dorothea, coldly. “I think it would do Celia\ngood—if she would take to it.”“But you are such a perfect horsewoman.”“Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily\nthrown.”“Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a\nperfect horsewoman, that she may accompany her husband.”“You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I\nought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond\nto your pattern of a lady.” Dorothea looked straight before her, and\nspoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy,\nin amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer.“I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution. It is\nnot possible that you should think horsemanship wrong.”“It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me.”“Oh, why?” said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance.Mr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was\nlistening.“We must not inquire too curiously into motives,” he interposed, in his\nmeasured way. “Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in\nthe utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep\nthe germinating grain away from the light.”Dorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the\nspeaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life,\nand with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could\nilluminate principle with the widest knowledge: a man whose learning\nalmost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed!"

  "content": "Dorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have\ngone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions,\nwhich has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.\nHas any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of\npre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?“Certainly,” said good Sir James. “Miss Brooke shall not be urged to\ntell reasons she would rather be silent upon. I am sure her reasons\nwould do her honor.”He was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had\nlooked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him that a girl to whom\nhe was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm\ntowards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a\nclergyman of some distinction.However, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with\nMr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook himself to\nCelia, and talked to her about her sister; spoke of a house in town,\nand asked whether Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from her sister,\nCelia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to himself that the\nsecond Miss Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty,\nthough not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than the\nelder sister. He felt that he had chosen the one who was in all\nrespects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to\nhaving the best. He would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who\npretended not to expect it.CHAPTER III.“Say, goddess, what ensued, when Raphael,\nThe affable archangel . . .\n                    Eve\nThe story heard attentive, and was filled\nWith admiration, and deep muse, to hear\nOf things so high and strange.”\n—_Paradise Lost_, B. vii.If it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a\nsuitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce her to accept him\nwere already planted in her mind, and by the evening of the next day\nthe reasons had budded and bloomed. For they had had a long\nconversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company\nof Mr. Casaubon’s moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to\nplay with the curate’s ill-shod but merry children."

  "content": "Dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of\nMr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine\nextension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own\nexperience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great\nwork, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he had been as\ninstructive as Milton’s “affable archangel;” and with something of the\narchangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what\nindeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness,\njustice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr.\nCasaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical\nfragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally\nrevealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm\nfooting there, the vast field of mythical constructions became\nintelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of\ncorrespondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no\nlight or speedy work. His notes already made a formidable range of\nvolumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous\nstill-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of\nHippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to\nDorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done\nto a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command:\nit is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the\nEnglish with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in\nany case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his\nacquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men,\nthat conne Latyn but lytille.”Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this\nconception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school\nliterature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile\ncomplete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who\nunited the glories of doctor and saint.The sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when\nDorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she\ncould speak of to no one whom she had before seen at Tipton, especially\non the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of\nbelief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self\nin communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed\nin the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she found in Mr.\nCasaubon a listener who understood her at once, who could assure her of\nhis own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise\nconformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to\nher.“He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he thinks a\nwhole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror. And his\nfeelings too, his whole experience—what a lake compared with my little\npool!”"

  "content": "Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly\nthan other young ladies of her age. Signs are small measurable things,\nbut interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent\nnature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a\nsky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of\nknowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself\nmay have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning\nsometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way\noff the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and\nthen arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was hasty in\nher trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was unworthy of\nit.He stayed a little longer than he had intended, on a slight pressure of\ninvitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except his own\ndocuments on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr. Casaubon was called\ninto the library to look at these in a heap, while his host picked up\nfirst one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and\nuncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a\n“Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing them all aside to open the\njournal of his youthful Continental travels.“Look here—here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of Rhamnus—you\nare a great Grecian, now. I don’t know whether you have given much\nstudy to the topography. I spent no end of time in making out these\nthings—Helicon, now. Here, now!—‘We started the next morning for\nParnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.’ All this volume is about\nGreece, you know,” Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his thumb transversely\nalong the edges of the leaves as he held the book forward.Mr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in\nthe right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as\npossible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this\ndesultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and\nthat the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an\namiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his endurance\naided also by the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?"

Before\nhe left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke\nalong the gravelled terrace, he had mentioned to her that he felt the\ndisadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship\nwith which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils\nof maturity. And he delivered this statement with as much careful\nprecision as if he had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be\nattended with results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that\nhe should have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or\npersonal kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the\n2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of\nthat date; judging by the standard of his own memory, which was a\nvolume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not\nthe ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten\nwriting. But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s confidence was not likely to\nbe falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he said with the\neager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in\nexperience is an epoch.It was three o’clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr.\nCasaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from\nTipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along\nthe shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the\nbordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk,\nthe Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in\ntheir walks. There had risen before her the girl’s vision of a possible\nfuture for herself to which she looked forward with trembling hope, and\nshe wanted to wander on in that visionary future without interruption.\nShe walked briskly in the brisk air, the color rose in her cheeks, and\nher straw bonnet (which our contemporaries might look at with\nconjectural curiosity as at an obsolete form of basket) fell a little\nbackward. She would perhaps be hardly characterized enough if it were\nomitted that she wore her brown hair flatly braided and coiled behind\nso as to expose the outline of her head in a daring manner at a time\nwhen public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be\ndissimulated by tall barricades of frizzed curls and bows, never\nsurpassed by any great race except the Feejeean. This was a trait of\nMiss Brooke’s asceticism. But there was nothing of an ascetic’s\nexpression in her bright full eyes, as she looked before her, not\nconsciously seeing, but absorbing into the intensity of her mood, the\nsolemn glory of the afternoon with its long swathes of light between\nthe far-off rows of limes, whose shadows touched each other."

But perhaps no persons\nthen living—certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton—would have had\na sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions\nabout marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm\nabout the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own\nfire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the pattern\nof plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron."
