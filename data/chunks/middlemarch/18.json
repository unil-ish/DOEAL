  "content": "“Haven’t you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be\nsomething better than a Middlemarch doctor?” said Lydgate, letting his\nhands fall on to his wife’s shoulders, and looking at her with\naffectionate gravity. “I shall make you learn my favorite bit from an\nold poet—‘Why should our pride make such a stir to be\nAnd be forgot? What good is like to this,\nTo do worthy the writing, and to write\nWorthy the reading and the worlds delight?’What I want, Rosy, is to do worthy the writing,—and to write out myself\nwhat I have done. A man must work, to do that, my pet.”“Of course, I wish you to make discoveries: no one could more wish you\nto attain a high position in some better place than Middlemarch. You\ncannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you from working. But we\ncannot live like hermits. You are not discontented with me, Tertius?”“No, dear, no. I am too entirely contented.”“But what did Mrs. Casaubon want to say to you?”“Merely to ask about her husband’s health. But I think she is going to\nbe splendid to our New Hospital: I think she will give us two hundred\na-year.”CHAPTER XLIV.I would not creep along the coast but steer\nOut in mid-sea, by guidance of the stars.When Dorothea, walking round the laurel-planted plots of the New\nHospital with Lydgate, had learned from him that there were no signs of\nchange in Mr. Casaubon’s bodily condition beyond the mental sign of\nanxiety to know the truth about his illness, she was silent for a few\nmoments, wondering whether she had said or done anything to rouse this\nnew anxiety. Lydgate, not willing to let slip an opportunity of\nfurthering a favorite purpose, ventured to say—“I don’t know whether your or Mr. Casaubon’s attention has been drawn\nto the needs of our New Hospital. Circumstances have made it seem\nrather egotistic in me to urge the subject; but that is not my fault:\nit is because there is a fight being made against it by the other\nmedical men. I think you are generally interested in such things, for I\nremember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing you at Tipton\nGrange before your marriage, you were asking me some questions about\nthe way in which the health of the poor was affected by their miserable\nhousing.”"

  "content": "“Yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, brightening. “I shall be quite grateful\nto you if you will tell me how I can help to make things a little\nbetter. Everything of that sort has slipped away from me since I have\nbeen married. I mean,” she said, after a moment’s hesitation, “that the\npeople in our village are tolerably comfortable, and my mind has been\ntoo much taken up for me to inquire further. But here—in such a place\nas Middlemarch—there must be a great deal to be done.”“There is everything to be done,” said Lydgate, with abrupt energy.\n“And this Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely to Mr.\nBulstrode’s exertions, and in a great degree to his money. But one man\ncan’t do everything in a scheme of this sort. Of course he looked\nforward to help. And now there’s a mean, petty feud set up against the\nthing in the town, by certain persons who want to make it a failure.”“What can be their reasons?” said Dorothea, with naive surprise.“Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode’s unpopularity, to begin with. Half the town\nwould almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him. In this stupid\nworld most people never consider that a thing is good to be done unless\nit is done by their own set. I had no connection with Bulstrode before\nI came here. I look at him quite impartially, and I see that he has\nsome notions—that he has set things on foot—which I can turn to good\npublic purpose. If a fair number of the better educated men went to\nwork with the belief that their observations might contribute to the\nreform of medical doctrine and practice, we should soon see a change\nfor the better. That’s my point of view. I hold that by refusing to\nwork with Mr. Bulstrode I should be turning my back on an opportunity\nof making my profession more generally serviceable.”“I quite agree with you,” said Dorothea, at once fascinated by the\nsituation sketched in Lydgate’s words. “But what is there against Mr.\nBulstrode? I know that my uncle is friendly with him.”“People don’t like his religious tone,” said Lydgate, breaking off\nthere.“That is all the stronger reason for despising such an opposition,”\nsaid Dorothea, looking at the affairs of Middlemarch by the light of\nthe great persecutions."

  "content": "“To put the matter quite fairly, they have other objections to him:—he\nis masterful and rather unsociable, and he is concerned with trade,\nwhich has complaints of its own that I know nothing about. But what has\nthat to do with the question whether it would not be a fine thing to\nestablish here a more valuable hospital than any they have in the\ncounty? The immediate motive to the opposition, however, is the fact\nthat Bulstrode has put the medical direction into my hands. Of course I\nam glad of that. It gives me an opportunity of doing some good\nwork,—and I am aware that I have to justify his choice of me. But the\nconsequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch have set\nthemselves tooth and nail against the Hospital, and not only refuse to\ncooperate themselves, but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder\nsubscriptions.”“How very petty!” exclaimed Dorothea, indignantly.“I suppose one must expect to fight one’s way: there is hardly anything\nto be done without it. And the ignorance of people about here is\nstupendous. I don’t lay claim to anything else than having used some\nopportunities which have not come within everybody’s reach; but there\nis no stifling the offence of being young, and a new-comer, and\nhappening to know something more than the old inhabitants. Still, if I\nbelieve that I can set going a better method of treatment—if I believe\nthat I can pursue certain observations and inquiries which may be a\nlasting benefit to medical practice, I should be a base truckler if I\nallowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me. And the\ncourse is all the clearer from there being no salary in question to put\nmy persistence in an equivocal light.”“I am glad you have told me this, Mr. Lydgate,” said Dorothea,\ncordially. “I feel sure I can help a little. I have some money, and\ndon’t know what to do with it—that is often an uncomfortable thought to\nme. I am sure I can spare two hundred a-year for a grand purpose like\nthis. How happy you must be, to know things that you feel sure will do\ngreat good! I wish I could awake with that knowledge every morning.\nThere seems to be so much trouble taken that one can hardly see the\ngood of!”There was a melancholy cadence in Dorothea’s voice as she spoke these\nlast words. But she presently added, more cheerfully, “Pray come to\nLowick and tell us more of this. I will mention the subject to Mr.\nCasaubon. I must hasten home now.”"

Mr.\nCasaubon made no objection beyond a passing remark that the sum might\nbe disproportionate in relation to other good objects, but when\nDorothea in her ignorance resisted that suggestion, he acquiesced. He\ndid not care himself about spending money, and was not reluctant to\ngive it. If he ever felt keenly any question of money it was through\nthe medium of another passion than the love of material property.Dorothea told him that she had seen Lydgate, and recited the gist of\nher conversation with him about the Hospital. Mr. Casaubon did not\nquestion her further, but he felt sure that she had wished to know what\nhad passed between Lydgate and himself. “She knows that I know,” said\nthe ever-restless voice within; but that increase of tacit knowledge\nonly thrust further off any confidence between them. He distrusted her\naffection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?CHAPTER XLV.It is the humor of many heads to extol the days of their forefathers,\nand declaim against the wickedness of times present. Which\nnotwithstanding they cannot handsomely do, without the borrowed help\nand satire of times past; condemning the vices of their own times, by\nthe expressions of vices in times which they commend, which cannot but\nargue the community of vice in both.

  "content": "That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to\nDorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different\nlights. He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded\nprejudice. Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a\ndetermination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by a hatred of that\nvital religion of which he had striven to be an effectual lay\nrepresentative—a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from\nreligion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of\nhuman action. These might be called the ministerial views. But\noppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which\nneed never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw\nforever on the vasts of ignorance. What the opposition in Middlemarch\nsaid about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a\ngreat deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody\nshall not be an originator; but there were differences which\nrepresented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr.\nMinchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the\nTankard in Slaughter Lane.Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration,\nthat Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to\npoison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your\nleave or with your leave; for it was a known “fac” that he had wanted\nto cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street,\nwho had money in trust before her marriage—a poor tale for a doctor,\nwho if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with\nyou before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you\nwere gone. If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was;\nbut there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was\na bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to\nthe cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with\ntheir pitch-plaisters—such a hanging business as that was not wanted in\nMiddlemarch!And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter\nLane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic\npublic-house—the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop’s—was\nthe resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to\nthe vote whether its long-standing medical man, “Doctor Gambit,” should\nnot be cashiered in favor of “this Doctor Lydgate,” who was capable of\nperforming the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether\ngiven up by other practitioners. But the balance had been turned\nagainst Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that\nthis power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal\nrecommendation, and might interfere with providential favors. In the\ncourse of the year, however, there had been a change in the public\nsentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop’s was an index."

  "content": "A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of\nLydgate’s skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided,\ndepending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the\nstomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not\nthe less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence. Patients\nwho had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare,\nlike old Featherstone’s, had been at once inclined to try him; also,\nmany who did not like paying their doctor’s bills, thought agreeably of\nopening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint\nif the children’s temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old\npractitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to\nemploy Lydgate held it likely that he was clever. Some considered that\nhe might do more than others “where there was liver;”—at least there\nwould be no harm in getting a few bottles of “stuff” from him, since if\nthese proved useless it would still be possible to return to the\nPurifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the\nyellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good Middlemarch\nfamilies were of course not going to change their doctor without reason\nshown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did not feel obliged\nto accept a new man merely in the character of his successor, objecting\nthat he was “not likely to be equal to Peacock.”But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars\nenough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to\nintensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being\nof that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden,\nlike a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a\nnote of exclamation at the end. The cubic feet of oxygen yearly\nswallowed by a full-grown man—what a shudder they might have created in\nsome Middlemarch circles! “Oxygen! nobody knows what that may be—is it\nany wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic? And yet there are people who\nsay quarantine is no good!”One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense\ndrugs. This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive\ndistinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with\nwhom he ranged himself; and only a little while before, they might have\ncounted on having the law on their side against a man who without\ncalling himself a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a\ncharge on drugs. But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee\nthat his new course would be even more offensive to the laity; and to\nMr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one\nof his patients, questioned him in an affable manner on the subject, he\nwas injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his\nreasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character\nof practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if their only\nmode of getting paid for their work was by their making out long bills\nfor draughts, boluses, and mixtures.“It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost\nas mischievous as quacks,” said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly. “To get\ntheir own bread they must overdose the king’s lieges; and that’s a bad\nsort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey—undermines the constitution in a fatal\nway.”"

  "content": "Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of\noutdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was also\nasthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of\nview, as well as from his own, he was an important man; indeed, an\nexceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid,\nand whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging\nkind—jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence\nfrom letting out the full force of his mind. It was Mr. Mawmsey’s\nfriendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of\nLydgate’s reply. But let the wise be warned against too great readiness\nat explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake, lengthening the\nsum for reckoners sure to go wrong.Lydgate smiled as he ended his speech, putting his foot into the\nstirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he had\nknown who the king’s lieges were, giving his “Good morning, sir,\ngood-morning, sir,” with the air of one who saw everything clearly\nenough. But in truth his views were perturbed. For years he had been\npaying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and\neighteen-pence he was certain something measurable had been delivered.\nHe had done this with satisfaction, including it among his\nresponsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill\nthan usual as a dignity worth mentioning. Moreover, in addition to the\nmassive benefit of the drugs to “self and family,” he had enjoyed the\npleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so\nas to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit—a\npractitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and\nespecially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had\nthe poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont\nto say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which\nappeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they\nwere recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as\na fertile mother,—generally under attendance more or less frequent from\nMr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr. Minchin."

Think of what I have to\nprovide for calling customers, my dear!”—here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to an\nintimate female friend who sat by—“a large veal pie—a stuffed fillet—a\nround of beef—ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera! But what keeps me up\nbest is the pink mixture, not the brown. I wonder, Mr. Mawmsey, with\n_your_ experience, you could have patience to listen. I should have\ntold him at once that I knew a little better than that.”“No, no, no,” said Mr. Mawmsey; “I was not going to tell him my\nopinion. Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto. But he\ndidn’t know who he was talking to. I was not to be turned on _his_\nfinger. People often pretend to tell me things, when they might as well\nsay, ‘Mawmsey, you’re a fool.’ But I smile at it: I humor everybody’s\nweak place. If physic had done harm to self and family, I should have\nfound it out by this time.”The next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic\nwas of no use.“Indeed!” said he, lifting his eyebrows with cautious surprise. (He was\na stout husky man with a large ring on his fourth finger.) “How will he\ncure his patients, then?”“That is what I say,” returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave weight\nto her speech by loading her pronouns. “Does _he_ suppose that people\nwill pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?”Mrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit, including\nvery full accounts of his own habits of body and other affairs; but of\ncourse he knew there was no innuendo in her remark, since his spare\ntime and personal narrative had never been charged for. So he replied,\nhumorously—“Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know.”“Not one that _I_ would employ,” said Mrs. Mawmsey. “_Others_ may do as\nthey please.”"

  "content": "Hence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer’s without fear of\nrivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those\nhypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their own\nhonesty, and that it might be worth some people’s while to show him up.\nMr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded by the\nsmells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments\nto a balance. And he did not think it worth his while to show Lydgate\nup until he knew how. He had not indeed great resources of education,\nand had had to work his own way against a good deal of professional\ncontempt; but he made none the worse accoucheur for calling the\nbreathing apparatus “longs.”Other medical men felt themselves more capable. Mr. Toller shared the\nhighest practice in the town and belonged to an old Middlemarch family:\nthere were Tollers in the law and everything else above the line of\nretail trade. Unlike our irascible friend Wrench, he had the easiest\nway in the world of taking things which might be supposed to annoy him,\nbeing a well-bred, quietly facetious man, who kept a good house, was\nvery fond of a little sporting when he could get it, very friendly with\nMr. Hawley, and hostile to Mr. Bulstrode. It may seem odd that with\nsuch pleasant habits he should have been given to the heroic treatment,\nbleeding and blistering and starving his patients, with a dispassionate\ndisregard to his personal example; but the incongruity favored the\nopinion of his ability among his patients, who commonly observed that\nMr. Toller had lazy manners, but his treatment was as active as you\ncould desire: no man, said they, carried more seriousness into his\nprofession: he was a little slow in coming, but when he came, he _did_\nsomething. He was a great favorite in his own circle, and whatever he\nimplied to any one’s disadvantage told doubly from his careless\nironical tone.He naturally got tired of smiling and saying, “Ah!” when he was told\nthat Mr. Peacock’s successor did not mean to dispense medicines; and\nMr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at a dinner-party, Mr.\nToller said, laughingly, “Dibbitts will get rid of his stale drugs,\nthen. I’m fond of little Dibbitts—I’m glad he’s in luck.”“I see your meaning, Toller,” said Mr. Hackbutt, “and I am entirely of\nyour opinion. I shall take an opportunity of expressing myself to that\neffect. A medical man should be responsible for the quality of the\ndrugs consumed by his patients. That is the rationale of the system of\ncharging which has hitherto obtained; and nothing is more offensive\nthan this ostentation of reform, where there is no real amelioration.”"

  "content": "“Ostentation, Hackbutt?” said Mr. Toller, ironically. “I don’t see\nthat. A man can’t very well be ostentatious of what nobody believes in.\nThere’s no reform in the matter: the question is, whether the profit on\nthe drugs is paid to the medical man by the druggist or by the patient,\nand whether there shall be extra pay under the name of attendance.”“Ah, to be sure; one of your damned new versions of old humbug,” said\nMr. Hawley, passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench.Mr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely at a\nparty, getting the more irritable in consequence.“As to humbug, Hawley,” he said, “that’s a word easy to fling about.\nBut what I contend against is the way medical men are fouling their own\nnest, and setting up a cry about the country as if a general\npractitioner who dispenses drugs couldn’t be a gentleman. I throw back\nthe imputation with scorn. I say, the most ungentlemanly trick a man\ncan be guilty of is to come among the members of his profession with\ninnovations which are a libel on their time-honored procedure. That is\nmy opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who\ncontradicts me.” Mr. Wrench’s voice had become exceedingly sharp.“I can’t oblige you there, Wrench,” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his\nhands into his trouser-pockets.“My dear fellow,” said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically, and looking\nat Mr. Wrench, “the physicians have their toes trodden on more than we\nhave. If you come to dignity it is a question for Minchin and Sprague.”“Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these\ninfringements?” said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to offer\nhis lights. “How does the law stand, eh, Hawley?”“Nothing to be done there,” said Mr. Hawley. “I looked into it for\nSprague. You’d only break your nose against a damned judge’s decision.”“Pooh! no need of law,” said Mr. Toller. “So far as practice is\nconcerned the attempt is an absurdity. No patient will like\nit—certainly not Peacock’s, who have been used to depletion. Pass the\nwine.”"

  "content": "Mr. Toller’s prediction was partly verified. If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey,\nwho had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by his supposed\ndeclaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called him\nin should watch a little anxiously to see whether he did “use all the\nmeans he might use” in the case. Even good Mr. Powderell, who in his\nconstant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the\nmore for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his\nmind disturbed with doubts during his wife’s attack of erysipelas, and\ncould not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a\nsimilar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not\notherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs.\nPowderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a\nremarkably hot August. At last, indeed, in the conflict between his\ndesire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no “means” should be\nlacking, he induced his wife privately to take Widgeon’s Purifying\nPills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease\nat the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood. This\nco-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mr.\nPowderell himself had no certain reliance on it, only hoping that it\nmight be attended with a blessing.But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate’s introduction he was helped by\nwhat we mortals rashly call good fortune. I suppose no doctor ever came\nnewly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody—cures\nwhich may be called fortune’s testimonials, and deserve as much credit\nas the written or printed kind. Various patients got well while Lydgate\nwas attending them, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it was\nremarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the merit\nof bringing people back from the brink of death. The trash talked on\nsuch occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it gave\nprecisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous\nman would desire, and was sure to be imputed to him by the simmering\ndislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his own part of\nignorant puffing. But even his proud outspokenness was checked by the\ndiscernment that it was as useless to fight against the interpretations\nof ignorance as to whip the fog; and “good fortune” insisted on using\nthose interpretations."

Nancy,\ncalling at home on her way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and\nhis wife, in whose attic she lodged, to read Dr. Minchin’s paper, and\nby this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the\nneighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at\nfirst declared to be as large and hard as a duck’s egg, but later in\nthe day to be about the size of “your fist.” Most hearers agreed that\nit would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of\n“squitchineal” as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body\nwhen taken enough of into the inside—the oil by gradually “soopling,”\nthe squitchineal by eating away.Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it happened to\nbe one of Lydgate’s days there. After questioning and examining her,\nLydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, “It’s not tumor:\nit’s cramp.” He ordered her a blister and some steel mixture, and told\nher to go home and rest, giving her at the same time a note to Mrs.\nLarcher, who, she said, was her best employer, to testify that she was\nin need of good food."

  "content": "But by-and-by Nancy, in her attic, became portentously worse, the\nsupposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only\nwandered to another region with angrier pain. The staymaker’s wife went\nto fetch Lydgate, and he continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy in\nher own home, until under his treatment she got quite well and went to\nwork again. But the case continued to be described as one of tumor in\nChurchyard Lane and other streets—nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for when\nLydgate’s remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin, he naturally\ndid not like to say, “The case was not one of tumor, and I was mistaken\nin describing it as such,” but answered, “Indeed! ah! I saw it was a\nsurgical case, not of a fatal kind.” He had been inwardly annoyed,\nhowever, when he had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he had\nrecommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a\nyoungster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what\nhad occurred: he privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general\npractitioner to contradict a physician’s diagnosis in that open manner,\nand afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably\ninattentive to etiquette. Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for\nvaluing himself or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such\nrectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal\nqualifications. But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not\nclearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for\nbeing of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate’s\nmethod as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his marvellous skill in\nthe speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she had been rolling and\nrolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and\nobstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield.How could Lydgate help himself? It is offensive to tell a lady when she\nis expressing her amazement at your skill, that she is altogether\nmistaken and rather foolish in her amazement. And to have entered into\nthe nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical\npropriety. Thus he had to wince under a promise of success given by\nthat ignorant praise which misses every valid quality.In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull,\nLydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an\nevery-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he\nwon. The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having been\na patient of Mr. Peacock’s, sent for Lydgate, whom he had expressed his\nintention to patronize. Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a good subject\nfor trying the expectant theory upon—watching the course of an\ninteresting disease when left as much as possible to itself, so that\nthe stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air with\nwhich he described his sensations Lydgate surmised that he would like\nto be taken into his medical man’s confidence, and be represented as a\npartner in his own cure. The auctioneer heard, without much surprise,\nthat his was a constitution which (always with due watching) might be\nleft to itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with\nall its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he probably had the\nrare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational\nprocedure, and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a\ngeneral benefit to society.Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view\nthat an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science."

And he\nwent without shrinking through his abstinence from drugs, much\nsustained by application of the thermometer which implied the\nimportance of his temperature, by the sense that he furnished objects\nfor the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited\nto the dignity of his secretions. For Lydgate was acute enough to\nindulge him with a little technical talk.It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a\ndisposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the\nstrength of his mind as well as constitution; and he was not backward\nin awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of\npatient he had to deal with. The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man,\nand liked to give others their due, feeling that he could afford it. He\nhad caught the words “expectant method,” and rang chimes on this and\nother learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate “knew a\nthing or two more than the rest of the doctors—was far better versed in\nthe secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers.”This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy’s illness had given\nto Mr. Wrench’s enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground.\nThe new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of\nrivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical\ncriticism or reflections on his hard-driven elders, who had had\nsomething else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions. His\npractice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the\nreport of his high family had led to his being pretty generally\ninvited, so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the\nbest houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed\nalways to end in a mutual attachment. There was hardly ever so much\nunanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant\nyoung fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to\nshow a crawling subservience to Bulstrode. That Mr. Farebrother, whose\nname was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended\nLydgate and made a friend of him, was referred to Farebrother’s\nunaccountable way of fighting on both sides."

Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be\nsorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of\nimprovement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but he had\nhad to spend large sums, and the building had lingered. Caleb Garth had\nundertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the interior\nfittings were begun had retired from the management of the business;\nand when referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode\nmight ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry and masonry,\nand had a notion both of drains and chimneys. In fact, the Hospital had\nbecome an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and he would\nwillingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule\nit dictatorially without any Board; but he had another favorite object\nwhich also required money for its accomplishment: he wished to buy some\nland in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and therefore he wished to get\nconsiderable contributions towards maintaining the Hospital. Meanwhile\nhe framed his plan of management. The Hospital was to be reserved for\nfever in all its forms; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent,\nthat he might have free authority to pursue all comparative\ninvestigations which his studies, particularly in Paris, had shown him\nthe importance of, the other medical visitors having a consultative\ninfluence, but no power to contravene Lydgate’s ultimate decisions; and\nthe general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of\nfive directors associated with Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in\nthe ratio of their contributions, the Board itself filling up any\nvacancy in its numbers, and no mob of small contributors being admitted\nto a share of government."

I must work the harder, that’s all,\nand I have given up my post at the Infirmary. The plan will flourish in\nspite of them, and then they’ll be glad to come in. Things can’t last\nas they are: there must be all sorts of reform soon, and then young\nfellows may be glad to come and study here.” Lydgate was in high\nspirits.“I shall not flinch, you may depend upon it, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr.\nBulstrode. “While I see you carrying out high intentions with vigor,\nyou shall have my unfailing support. And I have humble confidence that\nthe blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit\nof evil in this town will not be withdrawn. Suitable directors to\nassist me I have no doubt of securing. Mr. Brooke of Tipton has already\ngiven me his concurrence, and a pledge to contribute yearly: he has not\nspecified the sum—probably not a great one. But he will be a useful\nmember of the board.”A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate\nnothing, and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode.The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now. Neither Dr.\nSprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he disliked Lydgate’s knowledge, or\nhis disposition to improve treatment: what they disliked was his\narrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether deniable. They implied\nthat he was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless\ninnovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the\ncharlatan."

In\nthose days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St.\nJohn Long, “noblemen and gentlemen” attesting his extraction of a fluid\nlike mercury from the temples of a patient.Mr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that “Bulstrode\nhad found a man to suit him in Lydgate; a charlatan in religion is sure\nto like other sorts of charlatans.”“Yes, indeed, I can imagine,” said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number of\nthirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while; “there are so many\nof that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his irons, trying to make\npeople straight when the Almighty had made them crooked.”“No, no,” said Mr. Toller, “Cheshire was all right—all fair and above\nboard. But there’s St. John Long—that’s the kind of fellow we call a\ncharlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about: a\nfellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other\npeople. The other day he was pretending to tap a man’s brain and get\nquicksilver out of it.”“Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people’s constitutions!”\nsaid Mrs. Taft.After this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played\neven with respectable constitutions for his own purposes, and how much\nmore likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and\nsevens of hospital patients. Especially it was to be expected, as the\nlandlady of the Tankard had said, that he would recklessly cut up their\ndead bodies. For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby, who died apparently\nof a heart-disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms, too\ndaringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body, and thus gave\nan offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street, where that lady had\nlong resided on an income such as made this association of her body\nwith the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her memory.Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the\nHospital to Dorothea. We see that he was bearing enmity and silly\nmisconception with much spirit, aware that they were partly created by\nhis good share of success."

By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as possible: I have no\nseductions now away from home and work. And I am more and more\nconvinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous\norigin of all the tissues. Raspail and others are on the same track,\nand I have been losing time.”“I have no power of prophecy there,” said Mr. Farebrother, who had been\npuffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked; “but as to the\nhostility in the town, you’ll weather it if you are prudent.”“How am I to be prudent?” said Lydgate, “I just do what comes before me\nto do. I can’t help people’s ignorance and spite, any more than\nVesalius could. It isn’t possible to square one’s conduct to silly\nconclusions which nobody can foresee.”“Quite true; I didn’t mean that. I meant only two things. One is, keep\nyourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of course, you can go\non doing good work of your own by his help; but don’t get tied. Perhaps\nit seems like personal feeling in me to say so—and there’s a good deal\nof that, I own—but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you\nboil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion.”“Bulstrode is nothing to me,” said Lydgate, carelessly, “except on\npublic grounds. As to getting very closely united to him, I am not fond\nenough of him for that. But what was the other thing you meant?” said\nLydgate, who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible, and\nfeeling in no great need of advice.“Why, this. Take care—_experto crede_—take care not to get hampered\nabout money matters. I know, by a word you let fall one day, that you\ndon’t like my playing at cards so much for money. You are right enough\nthere. But try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven’t\ngot. I am perhaps talking rather superfluously; but a man likes to\nassume superiority over himself, by holding up his bad example and\nsermonizing on it.”Lydgate took Mr. Farebrother’s hints very cordially, though he would\nhardly have borne them from another man. He could not help remembering\nthat he had lately made some debts, but these had seemed inevitable,\nand he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way.\nThe furniture for which he owed would not want renewing; nor even the\nstock of wine for a long while."

A man conscious of\nenthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the\nmemory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds,\nand who hover in his mind as patron saints, invisibly helping. At home,\nthat same evening when he had been chatting with Mr. Farebrother, he\nhad his long legs stretched on the sofa, his head thrown back, and his\nhands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating attitude,\nwhile Rosamond sat at the piano, and played one tune after another, of\nwhich her husband only knew (like the emotional elephant he was!) that\nthey fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea-breezes.There was something very fine in Lydgate’s look just then, and any one\nmight have been encouraged to bet on his achievement. In his dark eyes\nand on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the\nfulness of contemplative thought—the mind not searching, but beholding,\nand the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it.Presently Rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close\nto the sofa and opposite her husband’s face.“Is that enough music for you, my lord?” she said, folding her hands\nbefore her and putting on a little air of meekness.“Yes, dear, if you are tired,” said Lydgate, gently, turning his eyes\nand resting them on her, but not otherwise moving. Rosamond’s presence\nat that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake,\nand her woman’s instinct in this matter was not dull.“What is absorbing you?” she said, leaning forward and bringing her\nface nearer to his.He moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders.“I am thinking of a great fellow, who was about as old as I am three\nhundred years ago, and had already begun a new era in anatomy.”“I can’t guess,” said Rosamond, shaking her head. “We used to play at\nguessing historical characters at Mrs. Lemon’s, but not anatomists.”“I’ll tell you. His name was Vesalius. And the only way he could get to\nknow anatomy as he did, was by going to snatch bodies at night, from\ngraveyards and places of execution.”“Oh!” said Rosamond, with a look of disgust on her pretty face, “I am\nvery glad you are not Vesalius. I should have thought he might find\nsome less horrible way than that.”“No, he couldn’t,” said Lydgate, going on too earnestly to take much\nnotice of her answer. “He could only get a complete skeleton by\nsnatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows, and\nburying them, and fetching them away by bits secretly, in the dead of\nnight.”"

No wonder the medical fogies in Middlemarch are\njealous, when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon\nVesalius because they had believed in Galen, and he showed that Galen\nwas wrong. They called him a liar and a poisonous monster. But the\nfacts of the human frame were on his side; and so he got the better of\nthem.”“And what happened to him afterwards?” said Rosamond, with some\ninterest.“Oh, he had a good deal of fighting to the last. And they did\nexasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his\nwork. Then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from Jerusalem to\ntake a great chair at Padua. He died rather miserably.”There was a moment’s pause before Rosamond said, “Do you know, Tertius,\nI often wish you had not been a medical man.”“Nay, Rosy, don’t say that,” said Lydgate, drawing her closer to him.\n“That is like saying you wish you had married another man.”“Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might easily have\nbeen something else. And your cousins at Quallingham all think that you\nhave sunk below them in your choice of a profession.”“The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!” said Lydgate, with\nscorn. “It was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort\nto you.”“Still,” said Rosamond, “I do _not_ think it is a nice profession,\ndear.” We know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion.“It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond,” said Lydgate,\ngravely. “And to say that you love me without loving the medical man in\nme, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach\nbut don’t like its flavor. Don’t say that again, dear, it pains me.”“Very well, Doctor Grave-face,” said Rosy, dimpling, “I will declare in\nfuture that I dote on skeletons, and body-snatchers, and bits of things\nin phials, and quarrels with everybody, that end in your dying\nmiserably.”“No, no, not so bad as that,” said Lydgate, giving up remonstrance and\npetting her resignedly."

And there were some who already\npredicted this event, declaring that a Reform Bill would never be\ncarried by the actual Parliament. This was what Will Ladislaw dwelt on\nto Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried\nhis strength at the hustings.“Things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year,” said Will.\n“The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the question\nof Reform has set in. There is likely to be another election before\nlong, and by that time Middlemarch will have got more ideas into its\nhead. What we have to work at now is the ‘Pioneer’ and political\nmeetings.”“Quite right, Ladislaw; we shall make a new thing of opinion here,”\nsaid Mr. Brooke. “Only I want to keep myself independent about Reform,\nyou know; I don’t want to go too far. I want to take up Wilberforce’s\nand Romilly’s line, you know, and work at Negro Emancipation, Criminal\nLaw—that kind of thing. But of course I should support Grey.”“If you go in for the principle of Reform, you must be prepared to take\nwhat the situation offers,” said Will. “If everybody pulled for his own\nbit against everybody else, the whole question would go to tatters.”"
