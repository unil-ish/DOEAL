  "content": "“Not immediately—no. In order to account for that wish I must\nmention—what it were otherwise needless to refer to—that my life, on\nall collateral accounts insignificant, derives a possible importance\nfrom the incompleteness of labors which have extended through all its\nbest years. In short, I have long had on hand a work which I would fain\nleave behind me in such a state, at least, that it might be committed\nto the press by—others. Were I assured that this is the utmost I can\nreasonably expect, that assurance would be a useful circumscription of\nmy attempts, and a guide in both the positive and negative\ndetermination of my course.”Here Mr. Casaubon paused, removed one hand from his back and thrust it\nbetween the buttons of his single-breasted coat. To a mind largely\ninstructed in the human destiny hardly anything could be more\ninteresting than the inward conflict implied in his formal measured\naddress, delivered with the usual sing-song and motion of the head.\nNay, are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle\nof the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the\nsignificance of its life—a significance which is to vanish as the\nwaters which come and go where no man has need of them? But there was\nnothing to strike others as sublime about Mr. Casaubon, and Lydgate,\nwho had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship, felt a little\namusement mingling with his pity. He was at present too ill acquainted\nwith disaster to enter into the pathos of a lot where everything is\nbelow the level of tragedy except the passionate egoism of the\nsufferer.“You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?” he said,\nwishing to help forward Mr. Casaubon’s purpose, which seemed to be\nclogged by some hesitation.“I do. You have not implied to me that the symptoms which—I am bound to\ntestify—you watched with scrupulous care, were those of a fatal\ndisease. But were it so, Mr. Lydgate, I should desire to know the truth\nwithout reservation, and I appeal to you for an exact statement of your\nconclusions: I request it as a friendly service. If you can tell me\nthat my life is not threatened by anything else than ordinary\ncasualties, I shall rejoice, on grounds which I have already indicated.\nIf not, knowledge of the truth is even more important to me.”"

  "content": "“Then I can no longer hesitate as to my course,” said Lydgate; “but the\nfirst thing I must impress on you is that my conclusions are doubly\nuncertain—uncertain not only because of my fallibility, but because\ndiseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found predictions on.\nIn any case, one can hardly increase appreciably the tremendous\nuncertainty of life.”Mr. Casaubon winced perceptibly, but bowed.“I believe that you are suffering from what is called fatty\ndegeneration of the heart, a disease which was first divined and\nexplored by Laennec, the man who gave us the stethoscope, not so very\nmany years ago. A good deal of experience—a more lengthened\nobservation—is wanting on the subject. But after what you have said, it\nis my duty to tell you that death from this disease is often sudden. At\nthe same time, no such result can be predicted. Your condition may be\nconsistent with a tolerably comfortable life for another fifteen years,\nor even more. I could add no information to this beyond anatomical or\nmedical details, which would leave expectation at precisely the same\npoint.” Lydgate’s instinct was fine enough to tell him that plain\nspeech, quite free from ostentatious caution, would be felt by Mr.\nCasaubon as a tribute of respect.“I thank you, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, after a moment’s pause.\n“One thing more I have still to ask: did you communicate what you have\nnow told me to Mrs. Casaubon?”“Partly—I mean, as to the possible issues.” Lydgate was going to\nexplain why he had told Dorothea, but Mr. Casaubon, with an\nunmistakable desire to end the conversation, waved his hand slightly,\nand said again, “I thank you,” proceeding to remark on the rare beauty\nof the day."

  "content": "Lydgate, certain that his patient wished to be alone, soon left him;\nand the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward continued\nto pace the walk where the dark yew-trees gave him a mute companionship\nin melancholy, and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted\nacross the isles of sunlight, stole along in silence as in the presence\nof a sorrow. Here was a man who now for the first time found himself\nlooking into the eyes of death—who was passing through one of those\nrare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace,\nwhich is as different from what we call knowing it, as the vision of\nwaters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the\nwater which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue. When the\ncommonplace “We must all die” transforms itself suddenly into the acute\nconsciousness “I must die—and soon,” then death grapples us, and his\nfingers are cruel; afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as\nour mother did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be\nlike the first. To Mr. Casaubon now, it was as if he suddenly found\nhimself on the dark river-brink and heard the plash of the oncoming\noar, not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons. In such an\nhour the mind does not change its lifelong bias, but carries it onward\nin imagination to the other side of death, gazing backward—perhaps with\nthe divine calm of beneficence, perhaps with the petty anxieties of\nself-assertion. What was Mr. Casaubon’s bias his acts will give us a\nclew to. He held himself to be, with some private scholarly\nreservations, a believing Christian, as to estimates of the present and\nhopes of the future. But what we strive to gratify, though we may call\nit a distant hope, is an immediate desire: the future estate for which\nmen drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love.\nAnd Mr. Casaubon’s immediate desire was not for divine communion and\nlight divested of earthly conditions; his passionate longings, poor\nman, clung low and mist-like in very shady places."

  "content": "Dorothea had been aware when Lydgate had ridden away, and she had\nstepped into the garden, with the impulse to go at once to her husband.\nBut she hesitated, fearing to offend him by obtruding herself; for her\nardor, continually repulsed, served, with her intense memory, to\nheighten her dread, as thwarted energy subsides into a shudder; and she\nwandered slowly round the nearer clumps of trees until she saw him\nadvancing. Then she went towards him, and might have represented a\nheaven-sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining\nshould yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to\na comprehended grief. His glance in reply to hers was so chill that she\nfelt her timidity increased; yet she turned and passed her hand through\nhis arm.Mr. Casaubon kept his hands behind him and allowed her pliant arm to\ncling with difficulty against his rigid arm.There was something horrible to Dorothea in the sensation which this\nunresponsive hardness inflicted on her. That is a strong word, but not\ntoo strong: it is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of\njoy are forever wasted, until men and women look round with haggard\nfaces at the devastation their own waste has made, and say, the earth\nbears no harvest of sweetness—calling their denial knowledge. You may\nask why, in the name of manliness, Mr. Casaubon should have behaved in\nthat way. Consider that his was a mind which shrank from pity: have you\never watched in such a mind the effect of a suspicion that what is\npressing it as a grief may be really a source of contentment, either\nactual or future, to the being who already offends by pitying? Besides,\nhe knew little of Dorothea’s sensations, and had not reflected that on\nsuch an occasion as the present they were comparable in strength to his\nown sensibilities about Carp’s criticisms."

  "content": "Dorothea did not withdraw her arm, but she could not venture to speak.\nMr. Casaubon did not say, “I wish to be alone,” but he directed his\nsteps in silence towards the house, and as they entered by the glass\ndoor on this eastern side, Dorothea withdrew her arm and lingered on\nthe matting, that she might leave her husband quite free. He entered\nthe library and shut himself in, alone with his sorrow.She went up to her boudoir. The open bow-window let in the serene glory\nof the afternoon lying in the avenue, where the lime-trees cast long\nshadows. But Dorothea knew nothing of the scene. She threw herself on a\nchair, not heeding that she was in the dazzling sun-rays: if there were\ndiscomfort in that, how could she tell that it was not part of her\ninward misery?She was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any she had\nfelt since her marriage. Instead of tears there came words:—“What have I done—what am I—that he should treat me so? He never knows\nwhat is in my mind—he never cares. What is the use of anything I do? He\nwishes he had never married me.”She began to hear herself, and was checked into stillness. Like one who\nhas lost his way and is weary, she sat and saw as in one glance all the\npaths of her young hope which she should never find again. And just as\nclearly in the miserable light she saw her own and her husband’s\nsolitude—how they walked apart so that she was obliged to survey him.\nIf he had drawn her towards him, she would never have surveyed\nhim—never have said, “Is he worth living for?” but would have felt him\nsimply a part of her own life. Now she said bitterly, “It is his fault,\nnot mine.” In the jar of her whole being, Pity was overthrown. Was it\nher fault that she had believed in him—had believed in his\nworthiness?—And what, exactly, was he?— She was able enough to estimate\nhim—she who waited on his glances with trembling, and shut her best\nsoul in prison, paying it only hidden visits, that she might be petty\nenough to please him. In such a crisis as this, some women begin to\nhate."

  "content": "The sun was low when Dorothea was thinking that she would not go down\nagain, but would send a message to her husband saying that she was not\nwell and preferred remaining up-stairs. She had never deliberately\nallowed her resentment to govern her in this way before, but she\nbelieved now that she could not see him again without telling him the\ntruth about her feeling, and she must wait till she could do it without\ninterruption. He might wonder and be hurt at her message. It was good\nthat he should wonder and be hurt. Her anger said, as anger is apt to\nsay, that God was with her—that all heaven, though it were crowded with\nspirits watching them, must be on her side. She had determined to ring\nher bell, when there came a rap at the door.Mr. Casaubon had sent to say that he would have his dinner in the\nlibrary. He wished to be quite alone this evening, being much occupied.“I shall not dine, then, Tantripp.”“Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?”“No; I am not well. Get everything ready in my dressing room, but pray\ndo not disturb me again.”Dorothea sat almost motionless in her meditative struggle, while the\nevening slowly deepened into night. But the struggle changed\ncontinually, as that of a man who begins with a movement towards\nstriking and ends with conquering his desire to strike. The energy that\nwould animate a crime is not more than is wanted to inspire a resolved\nsubmission, when the noble habit of the soul reasserts itself. That\nthought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her husband—her\nconviction that he had been asking about the possible arrest of all his\nwork, and that the answer must have wrung his heart, could not be long\nwithout rising beside the image of him, like a shadowy monitor looking\nat her anger with sad remonstrance. It cost her a litany of pictured\nsorrows and of silent cries that she might be the mercy for those\nsorrows—but the resolved submission did come; and when the house was\nstill, and she knew that it was near the time when Mr. Casaubon\nhabitually went to rest, she opened her door gently and stood outside\nin the darkness waiting for his coming up-stairs with a light in his\nhand. If he did not come soon she thought that she would go down and\neven risk incurring another pang. She would never again expect anything\nelse. But she did hear the library door open, and slowly the light\nadvanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the\ncarpet. When her husband stood opposite to her, she saw that his face\nwas more haggard. He started slightly on seeing her, and she looked up\nat him beseechingly, without speaking.“Dorothea!” he said, with a gentle surprise in his tone. “Were you\nwaiting for me?”“Yes, I did not like to disturb you.”"

  "content": "“Come, my dear, come. You are young, and need not to extend your life\nby watching.”When the kind quiet melancholy of that speech fell on Dorothea’s ears,\nshe felt something like the thankfulness that might well up in us if we\nhad narrowly escaped hurting a lamed creature. She put her hand into\nher husband’s, and they went along the broad corridor together.BOOK V.\nTHE DEAD HAND.CHAPTER XLIII.“This figure hath high price: ’t was wrought with love\nAges ago in finest ivory;\nNought modish in it, pure and noble lines\nOf generous womanhood that fits all time\nThat too is costly ware; majolica\nOf deft design, to please a lordly eye:\nThe smile, you see, is perfect—wonderful\nAs mere Faience! a table ornament\nTo suit the richest mounting.”Dorothea seldom left home without her husband, but she did occasionally\ndrive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of shopping or charity\nsuch as occur to every lady of any wealth when she lives within three\nmiles of a town. Two days after that scene in the Yew-tree Walk, she\ndetermined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see\nLydgate, and learn from him whether her husband had really felt any\ndepressing change of symptoms which he was concealing from her, and\nwhether he had insisted on knowing the utmost about himself. She felt\nalmost guilty in asking for knowledge about him from another, but the\ndread of being without it—the dread of that ignorance which would make\nher unjust or hard—overcame every scruple. That there had been some\ncrisis in her husband’s mind she was certain: he had the very next day\nbegun a new method of arranging his notes, and had associated her quite\nnewly in carrying out his plan. Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores\nof patience.It was about four o’clock when she drove to Lydgate’s house in Lowick\nGate, wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at home, that she\nhad written beforehand. And he was not at home.“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea, who had never, that she knew\nof, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage. Yes,\nMrs. Lydgate was at home."

Will you ask her\nif she can see me—see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?”When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea could hear\nsounds of music through an open window—a few notes from a man’s voice\nand then a piano bursting into roulades. But the roulades broke off\nsuddenly, and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would\nbe happy to see Mrs. Casaubon."

  "content": "When the drawing-room door opened and Dorothea entered, there was a\nsort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the\ndifferent ranks were less blent than now. Let those who know, tell us\nexactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in those days of mild\nautumn—that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the\neye. It always seemed to have been lately washed, and to smell of the\nsweet hedges—was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging\nall out of the fashion. Yet if she had entered before a still audience\nas Imogene or Cato’s daughter, the dress might have seemed right\nenough: the grace and dignity were in her limbs and neck; and about her\nsimply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then\nin the fate of women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold\ntrencher we call a halo. By the present audience of two persons, no\ndramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs.\nCasaubon. To Rosamond she was one of those county divinities not mixing\nwith Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner or\nappearance were worthy of her study; moreover, Rosamond was not without\nsatisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying\n_her_. What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the\nbest judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at\nSir Godwin Lydgate’s, she felt quite confident of the impression she\nmust make on people of good birth. Dorothea put out her hand with her\nusual simple kindness, and looked admiringly at Lydgate’s lovely\nbride—aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but\nseeing him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle. The gentleman was\ntoo much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on the\ncontrast between the two—a contrast that would certainly have been\nstriking to a calm observer. They were both tall, and their eyes were\non a level; but imagine Rosamond’s infantine blondness and wondrous\ncrown of hair-plaits, with her pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so\nperfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a large\nembroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders would know\nthe price of, her small hands duly set off with rings, and that\ncontrolled self-consciousness of manner which is the expensive\nsubstitute for simplicity."

  "content": "“Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you,” said Dorothea,\nimmediately. “I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I go\nhome, and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find\nhim, or even allow me to wait for him, if you expect him soon.”“He is at the New Hospital,” said Rosamond; “I am not sure how soon he\nwill come home. But I can send for him.”“Will you let me go and fetch him?” said Will Ladislaw, coming forward.\nHe had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered. She colored\nwith surprise, but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable\npleasure, saying—“I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here.”“May I go to the Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to see\nhim?” said Will.“It would be quicker to send the carriage for him,” said Dorothea, “if\nyou will be kind enough to give the message to the coachman.”Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an\ninstant over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, “I will\ngo myself, thank you. I wish to lose no time before getting home again.\nI will drive to the Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there. Pray excuse me,\nMrs. Lydgate. I am very much obliged to you.”Her mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she left\nthe room hardly conscious of what was immediately around her—hardly\nconscious that Will opened the door for her and offered her his arm to\nlead her to the carriage. She took the arm but said nothing. Will was\nfeeling rather vexed and miserable, and found nothing to say on his\nside. He handed her into the carriage in silence, they said good-by,\nand Dorothea drove away."

 {
  "role": "user",
  "content": "In the five minutes’ drive to the Hospital she had time for some\nreflections that were quite new to her. Her decision to go, and her\npreoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that\nthere would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any\nfurther intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to\nmention to her husband, and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a\nmatter of concealment. That was all that had been explicitly in her\nmind; but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort. Now that she\nwas alone in her drive, she heard the notes of the man’s voice and the\naccompanying piano, which she had not noted much at the time, returning\non her inward sense; and she found herself thinking with some wonder\nthat Will Ladislaw was passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her\nhusband’s absence. And then she could not help remembering that he had\npassed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there\nbe any unfitness in the fact? But Will was Mr. Casaubon’s relative, and\none towards whom she was bound to show kindness. Still there had been\nsigns which perhaps she ought to have understood as implying that Mr.\nCasaubon did not like his cousin’s visits during his own absence.\n“Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,” said poor Dorothea to\nherself, while the tears came rolling and she had to dry them quickly.\nShe felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so\nclear to her before was mysteriously spoiled. But the carriage stopped\nat the gate of the Hospital. She was soon walking round the grass plots\nwith Lydgate, and her feelings recovered the strong bent which had made\nher seek for this interview."

  "content": "Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of it\nclearly enough. His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and here for\nthe first time there had come a chance which had set him at a\ndisadvantage. It was not only, as it had been hitherto, that she was\nnot supremely occupied with him, but that she had seen him under\ncircumstances in which he might appear not to be supremely occupied\nwith her. He felt thrust to a new distance from her, amongst the\ncircles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life. But that was\nnot his fault: of course, since he had taken his lodgings in the town,\nhe had been making as many acquaintances as he could, his position\nrequiring that he should know everybody and everything. Lydgate was\nreally better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood, and\nhe happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling\nupon. Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had\ndescended too unexpectedly on her worshipper. It was mortifying. Will\nwas conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but for\nDorothea; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him from\nher with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to\nthe persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome\nand Britain. Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy\nin the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices,\nlike odorous bodies, have a double existence both solid and\nsubtle—solid as the pyramids, subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo,\nor as the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness. And Will\nwas of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties: a man\nof clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as he did, that for the\nfirst time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had\nsprung up in Dorothea’s mind, and that their silence, as he conducted\nher to the carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Casaubon, in his\nhatred and jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid\nbelow her socially. Confound Casaubon!"

May I come\nanother day and just finish about the rendering of ‘Lungi dal caro\nbene’?”“I shall be happy to be taught,” said Rosamond. “But I am sure you\nadmit that the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your\nacquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she very clever? She looks as if\nshe were.”“Really, I never thought about it,” said Will, sulkily.“That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him if she\nwere handsome. What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of when you\nare with Mrs. Casaubon?”“Herself,” said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs.\nLydgate. “When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of her\nattributes—one is conscious of her presence.”“I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,” said Rosamond,\ndimpling, and speaking with aery lightness. “He will come back and\nthink nothing of me.”“That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto. Mrs.\nCasaubon is too unlike other women for them to be compared with her.”“You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see her, I\nsuppose.”“No,” said Will, almost pettishly. “Worship is usually a matter of\ntheory rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess just\nat this moment—I must really tear myself away.”“Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music,\nand I cannot enjoy it so well without him.”When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of\nhim and holding his coat-collar with both her hands, “Mr. Ladislaw was\nhere singing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in. He seemed vexed. Do\nyou think he disliked her seeing him at our house? Surely your position\nis more than equal to his—whatever may be his relation to the\nCasaubons.”"

Do you like him?”“Yes: I think he is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and\nbric-a-brac, but likable.”“Do you know, I think he adores Mrs. Casaubon.”“Poor devil!” said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his wife’s ears.Rosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the world,\nespecially in discovering what when she was in her unmarried girlhood\nhad been inconceivable to her except as a dim tragedy in by-gone\ncostumes—that women, even after marriage, might make conquests and\nenslave men. At that time young ladies in the country, even when\neducated at Mrs. Lemon’s, read little French literature later than\nRacine, and public prints had not cast their present magnificent\nillumination over the scandals of life. Still, vanity, with a woman’s\nwhole mind and day to work in, can construct abundantly on slight\nhints, especially on such a hint as the possibility of indefinite\nconquests. How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage\nwith a husband as crown-prince by your side—himself in fact a\nsubject—while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing their rest\nprobably, and if their appetite too, so much the better! But Rosamond’s\nromance turned at present chiefly on her crown-prince, and it was\nenough to enjoy his assured subjection. When he said, “Poor devil!” she\nasked, with playful curiosity—“Why so?”“Why, what can a man do when he takes to adoring one of you mermaids?\nHe only neglects his work and runs up bills.”“I am sure you do not neglect your work.

You\ncannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you from working. But we\ncannot live like hermits. You are not discontented with me, Tertius?”“No, dear, no.

But I think she is going to\nbe splendid to our New Hospital: I think she will give us two hundred\na-year.”CHAPTER XLIV.I would not creep along the coast but steer\nOut in mid-sea, by guidance of the stars.When Dorothea, walking round the laurel-planted plots of the New\nHospital with Lydgate, had learned from him that there were no signs of\nchange in Mr. Casaubon’s bodily condition beyond the mental sign of\nanxiety to know the truth about his illness, she was silent for a few\nmoments, wondering whether she had said or done anything to rouse this\nnew anxiety. Lydgate, not willing to let slip an opportunity of\nfurthering a favorite purpose, ventured to say—“I don’t know whether your or Mr. Casaubon’s attention has been drawn\nto the needs of our New Hospital. Circumstances have made it seem\nrather egotistic in me to urge the subject; but that is not my fault:\nit is because there is a fight being made against it by the other\nmedical men. I think you are generally interested in such things, for I\nremember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing you at Tipton\nGrange before your marriage, you were asking me some questions about\nthe way in which the health of the poor was affected by their miserable\nhousing.”"

  "content": "“Yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, brightening. “I shall be quite grateful\nto you if you will tell me how I can help to make things a little\nbetter. Everything of that sort has slipped away from me since I have\nbeen married. I mean,” she said, after a moment’s hesitation, “that the\npeople in our village are tolerably comfortable, and my mind has been\ntoo much taken up for me to inquire further. But here—in such a place\nas Middlemarch—there must be a great deal to be done.”“There is everything to be done,” said Lydgate, with abrupt energy.\n“And this Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely to Mr.\nBulstrode’s exertions, and in a great degree to his money. But one man\ncan’t do everything in a scheme of this sort. Of course he looked\nforward to help. And now there’s a mean, petty feud set up against the\nthing in the town, by certain persons who want to make it a failure.”“What can be their reasons?” said Dorothea, with naive surprise.“Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode’s unpopularity, to begin with. Half the town\nwould almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him. In this stupid\nworld most people never consider that a thing is good to be done unless\nit is done by their own set. I had no connection with Bulstrode before\nI came here. I look at him quite impartially, and I see that he has\nsome notions—that he has set things on foot—which I can turn to good\npublic purpose. If a fair number of the better educated men went to\nwork with the belief that their observations might contribute to the\nreform of medical doctrine and practice, we should soon see a change\nfor the better. That’s my point of view. I hold that by refusing to\nwork with Mr. Bulstrode I should be turning my back on an opportunity\nof making my profession more generally serviceable.”“I quite agree with you,” said Dorothea, at once fascinated by the\nsituation sketched in Lydgate’s words. “But what is there against Mr.\nBulstrode? I know that my uncle is friendly with him.”“People don’t like his religious tone,” said Lydgate, breaking off\nthere.“That is all the stronger reason for despising such an opposition,”\nsaid Dorothea, looking at the affairs of Middlemarch by the light of\nthe great persecutions."

But what has\nthat to do with the question whether it would not be a fine thing to\nestablish here a more valuable hospital than any they have in the\ncounty? The immediate motive to the opposition, however, is the fact\nthat Bulstrode has put the medical direction into my hands. Of course I\nam glad of that. It gives me an opportunity of doing some good\nwork,—and I am aware that I have to justify his choice of me. But the\nconsequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch have set\nthemselves tooth and nail against the Hospital, and not only refuse to\ncooperate themselves, but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder\nsubscriptions.”“How very petty!” exclaimed Dorothea, indignantly.“I suppose one must expect to fight one’s way: there is hardly anything\nto be done without it. And the ignorance of people about here is\nstupendous. I don’t lay claim to anything else than having used some\nopportunities which have not come within everybody’s reach; but there\nis no stifling the offence of being young, and a new-comer, and\nhappening to know something more than the old inhabitants. Still, if I\nbelieve that I can set going a better method of treatment—if I believe\nthat I can pursue certain observations and inquiries which may be a\nlasting benefit to medical practice, I should be a base truckler if I\nallowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me. And the\ncourse is all the clearer from there being no salary in question to put\nmy persistence in an equivocal light.”“I am glad you have told me this, Mr. Lydgate,” said Dorothea,\ncordially. “I feel sure I can help a little. I have some money, and\ndon’t know what to do with it—that is often an uncomfortable thought to\nme. I am sure I can spare two hundred a-year for a grand purpose like\nthis. How happy you must be, to know things that you feel sure will do\ngreat good! I wish I could awake with that knowledge every morning.\nThere seems to be so much trouble taken that one can hardly see the\ngood of!”There was a melancholy cadence in Dorothea’s voice as she spoke these\nlast words. But she presently added, more cheerfully, “Pray come to\nLowick and tell us more of this. I will mention the subject to Mr.\nCasaubon. I must hasten home now.”"

Mr.\nCasaubon made no objection beyond a passing remark that the sum might\nbe disproportionate in relation to other good objects, but when\nDorothea in her ignorance resisted that suggestion, he acquiesced. He\ndid not care himself about spending money, and was not reluctant to\ngive it. If he ever felt keenly any question of money it was through\nthe medium of another passion than the love of material property.Dorothea told him that she had seen Lydgate, and recited the gist of\nher conversation with him about the Hospital. Mr. Casaubon did not\nquestion her further, but he felt sure that she had wished to know what\nhad passed between Lydgate and himself. “She knows that I know,” said\nthe ever-restless voice within; but that increase of tacit knowledge\nonly thrust further off any confidence between them. He distrusted her\naffection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?CHAPTER XLV.It is the humor of many heads to extol the days of their forefathers,\nand declaim against the wickedness of times present. Which\nnotwithstanding they cannot handsomely do, without the borrowed help\nand satire of times past; condemning the vices of their own times, by\nthe expressions of vices in times which they commend, which cannot but\nargue the community of vice in both.

  "content": "That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to\nDorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different\nlights. He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded\nprejudice. Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a\ndetermination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by a hatred of that\nvital religion of which he had striven to be an effectual lay\nrepresentative—a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from\nreligion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of\nhuman action. These might be called the ministerial views. But\noppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which\nneed never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw\nforever on the vasts of ignorance. What the opposition in Middlemarch\nsaid about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a\ngreat deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody\nshall not be an originator; but there were differences which\nrepresented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr.\nMinchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the\nTankard in Slaughter Lane.Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration,\nthat Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to\npoison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your\nleave or with your leave; for it was a known “fac” that he had wanted\nto cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street,\nwho had money in trust before her marriage—a poor tale for a doctor,\nwho if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with\nyou before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you\nwere gone. If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was;\nbut there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was\na bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to\nthe cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with\ntheir pitch-plaisters—such a hanging business as that was not wanted in\nMiddlemarch!And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter\nLane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic\npublic-house—the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop’s—was\nthe resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to\nthe vote whether its long-standing medical man, “Doctor Gambit,” should\nnot be cashiered in favor of “this Doctor Lydgate,” who was capable of\nperforming the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether\ngiven up by other practitioners. But the balance had been turned\nagainst Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that\nthis power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal\nrecommendation, and might interfere with providential favors. In the\ncourse of the year, however, there had been a change in the public\nsentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop’s was an index."

  "content": "A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of\nLydgate’s skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided,\ndepending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the\nstomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not\nthe less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence. Patients\nwho had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare,\nlike old Featherstone’s, had been at once inclined to try him; also,\nmany who did not like paying their doctor’s bills, thought agreeably of\nopening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint\nif the children’s temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old\npractitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to\nemploy Lydgate held it likely that he was clever. Some considered that\nhe might do more than others “where there was liver;”—at least there\nwould be no harm in getting a few bottles of “stuff” from him, since if\nthese proved useless it would still be possible to return to the\nPurifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the\nyellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good Middlemarch\nfamilies were of course not going to change their doctor without reason\nshown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did not feel obliged\nto accept a new man merely in the character of his successor, objecting\nthat he was “not likely to be equal to Peacock.”But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars\nenough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to\nintensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being\nof that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden,\nlike a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a\nnote of exclamation at the end. The cubic feet of oxygen yearly\nswallowed by a full-grown man—what a shudder they might have created in\nsome Middlemarch circles! “Oxygen! nobody knows what that may be—is it\nany wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic? And yet there are people who\nsay quarantine is no good!”One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense\ndrugs. This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive\ndistinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with\nwhom he ranged himself; and only a little while before, they might have\ncounted on having the law on their side against a man who without\ncalling himself a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a\ncharge on drugs. But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee\nthat his new course would be even more offensive to the laity; and to\nMr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one\nof his patients, questioned him in an affable manner on the subject, he\nwas injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his\nreasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character\nof practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if their only\nmode of getting paid for their work was by their making out long bills\nfor draughts, boluses, and mixtures.“It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost\nas mischievous as quacks,” said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly. “To get\ntheir own bread they must overdose the king’s lieges; and that’s a bad\nsort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey—undermines the constitution in a fatal\nway.”"

  "content": "Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of\noutdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was also\nasthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of\nview, as well as from his own, he was an important man; indeed, an\nexceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid,\nand whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging\nkind—jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence\nfrom letting out the full force of his mind. It was Mr. Mawmsey’s\nfriendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of\nLydgate’s reply. But let the wise be warned against too great readiness\nat explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake, lengthening the\nsum for reckoners sure to go wrong.Lydgate smiled as he ended his speech, putting his foot into the\nstirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he had\nknown who the king’s lieges were, giving his “Good morning, sir,\ngood-morning, sir,” with the air of one who saw everything clearly\nenough. But in truth his views were perturbed. For years he had been\npaying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and\neighteen-pence he was certain something measurable had been delivered.\nHe had done this with satisfaction, including it among his\nresponsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill\nthan usual as a dignity worth mentioning. Moreover, in addition to the\nmassive benefit of the drugs to “self and family,” he had enjoyed the\npleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so\nas to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit—a\npractitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and\nespecially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had\nthe poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont\nto say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which\nappeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they\nwere recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as\na fertile mother,—generally under attendance more or less frequent from\nMr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr. Minchin."

Think of what I have to\nprovide for calling customers, my dear!”—here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to an\nintimate female friend who sat by—“a large veal pie—a stuffed fillet—a\nround of beef—ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera! But what keeps me up\nbest is the pink mixture, not the brown. I wonder, Mr. Mawmsey, with\n_your_ experience, you could have patience to listen. I should have\ntold him at once that I knew a little better than that.”“No, no, no,” said Mr. Mawmsey; “I was not going to tell him my\nopinion. Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto. But he\ndidn’t know who he was talking to. I was not to be turned on _his_\nfinger. People often pretend to tell me things, when they might as well\nsay, ‘Mawmsey, you’re a fool.’ But I smile at it: I humor everybody’s\nweak place. If physic had done harm to self and family, I should have\nfound it out by this time.”The next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic\nwas of no use.“Indeed!” said he, lifting his eyebrows with cautious surprise. (He was\na stout husky man with a large ring on his fourth finger.) “How will he\ncure his patients, then?”“That is what I say,” returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave weight\nto her speech by loading her pronouns. “Does _he_ suppose that people\nwill pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?”Mrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit, including\nvery full accounts of his own habits of body and other affairs; but of\ncourse he knew there was no innuendo in her remark, since his spare\ntime and personal narrative had never been charged for. So he replied,\nhumorously—“Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know.”“Not one that _I_ would employ,” said Mrs. Mawmsey. “_Others_ may do as\nthey please.”"
