  "content": "Happily Lydgate had ended by losing in the billiard-room, and brought\naway no encouragement to make a raid on luck. On the contrary, he felt\nunmixed disgust with himself the next day when he had to pay four or\nfive pounds over and above his gains, and he carried about with him a\nmost unpleasant vision of the figure he had made, not only rubbing\nelbows with the men at the Green Dragon but behaving just as they did.\nA philosopher fallen to betting is hardly distinguishable from a\nPhilistine under the same circumstances: the difference will chiefly be\nfound in his subsequent reflections, and Lydgate chewed a very\ndisagreeable cud in that way. His reason told him how the affair might\nhave been magnified into ruin by a slight change of scenery—if it had\nbeen a gambling-house that he had turned into, where chance could be\nclutched with both hands instead of being picked up with thumb and\nfore-finger. Nevertheless, though reason strangled the desire to\ngamble, there remained the feeling that, with an assurance of luck to\nthe needful amount, he would have liked to gamble, rather than take the\nalternative which was beginning to urge itself as inevitable.That alternative was to apply to Mr. Bulstrode. Lydgate had so many\ntimes boasted both to himself and others that he was totally\nindependent of Bulstrode, to whose plans he had lent himself solely\nbecause they enabled him to carry out his own ideas of professional\nwork and public benefit—he had so constantly in their personal\nintercourse had his pride sustained by the sense that he was making a\ngood social use of this predominating banker, whose opinions he thought\ncontemptible and whose motives often seemed to him an absurd mixture of\ncontradictory impressions—that he had been creating for himself strong\nideal obstacles to the proffering of any considerable request to him on\nhis own account.Still, early in March his affairs were at that pass in which men begin\nto say that their oaths were delivered in ignorance, and to perceive\nthat the act which they had called impossible to them is becoming\nmanifestly possible. With Dover’s ugly security soon to be put in\nforce, with the proceeds of his practice immediately absorbed in paying\nback debts, and with the chance, if the worst were known, of daily\nsupplies being refused on credit, above all with the vision of\nRosamond’s hopeless discontent continually haunting him, Lydgate had\nbegun to see that he should inevitably bend himself to ask help from\nsomebody or other. At first he had considered whether he should write\nto Mr. Vincy; but on questioning Rosamond he found that, as he had\nsuspected, she had already applied twice to her father, the last time\nbeing since the disappointment from Sir Godwin; and papa had said that\nLydgate must look out for himself. “Papa said he had come, with one bad\nyear after another, to trade more and more on borrowed capital, and had\nhad to give up many indulgences; he could not spare a single hundred\nfrom the charges of his family. He said, let Lydgate ask Bulstrode:\nthey have always been hand and glove.”"

  "content": "Indeed, Lydgate himself had come to the conclusion that if he must end\nby asking for a free loan, his relations with Bulstrode, more at least\nthan with any other man, might take the shape of a claim which was not\npurely personal. Bulstrode had indirectly helped to cause the failure\nof his practice, and had also been highly gratified by getting a\nmedical partner in his plans:—but who among us ever reduced himself to\nthe sort of dependence in which Lydgate now stood, without trying to\nbelieve that he had claims which diminished the humiliation of asking?\nIt was true that of late there had seemed to be a new languor of\ninterest in Bulstrode about the Hospital; but his health had got worse,\nand showed signs of a deep-seated nervous affection. In other respects\nhe did not appear to be changed: he had always been highly polite, but\nLydgate had observed in him from the first a marked coldness about his\nmarriage and other private circumstances, a coldness which he had\nhitherto preferred to any warmth of familiarity between them. He\ndeferred the intention from day to day, his habit of acting on his\nconclusions being made infirm by his repugnance to every possible\nconclusion and its consequent act. He saw Mr. Bulstrode often, but he\ndid not try to use any occasion for his private purpose. At one moment\nhe thought, “I will write a letter: I prefer that to any circuitous\ntalk;” at another he thought, “No; if I were talking to him, I could\nmake a retreat before any signs of disinclination.”Still the days passed and no letter was written, no special interview\nsought. In his shrinking from the humiliation of a dependent attitude\ntowards Bulstrode, he began to familiarize his imagination with another\nstep even more unlike his remembered self. He began spontaneously to\nconsider whether it would be possible to carry out that puerile notion\nof Rosamond’s which had often made him angry, namely, that they should\nquit Middlemarch without seeing anything beyond that preface. The\nquestion came—“Would any man buy the practice of me even now, for as\nlittle as it is worth? Then the sale might happen as a necessary\npreparation for going away.”But against his taking this step, which he still felt to be a\ncontemptible relinquishment of present work, a guilty turning aside\nfrom what was a real and might be a widening channel for worthy\nactivity, to start again without any justified destination, there was\nthis obstacle, that the purchaser, if procurable at all, might not be\nquickly forthcoming. And afterwards? Rosamond in a poor lodging, though\nin the largest city or most distant town, would not find the life that\ncould save her from gloom, and save him from the reproach of having\nplunged her into it. For when a man is at the foot of the hill in his\nfortunes, he may stay a long while there in spite of professional\naccomplishment. In the British climate there is no incompatibility\nbetween scientific insight and furnished lodgings: the incompatibility\nis chiefly between scientific ambition and a wife who objects to that\nkind of residence."

  "content": "But in the midst of his hesitation, opportunity came to decide him. A\nnote from Mr. Bulstrode requested Lydgate to call on him at the Bank. A\nhypochondriacal tendency had shown itself in the banker’s constitution\nof late; and a lack of sleep, which was really only a slight\nexaggeration of an habitual dyspeptic symptom, had been dwelt on by him\nas a sign of threatening insanity. He wanted to consult Lydgate without\ndelay on that particular morning, although he had nothing to tell\nbeyond what he had told before. He listened eagerly to what Lydgate had\nto say in dissipation of his fears, though this too was only\nrepetition; and this moment in which Bulstrode was receiving a medical\nopinion with a sense of comfort, seemed to make the communication of a\npersonal need to him easier than it had been in Lydgate’s contemplation\nbeforehand. He had been insisting that it would be well for Mr.\nBulstrode to relax his attention to business.“One sees how any mental strain, however slight, may affect a delicate\nframe,” said Lydgate at that stage of the consultation when the remarks\ntend to pass from the personal to the general, “by the deep stamp which\nanxiety will make for a time even on the young and vigorous. I am\nnaturally very strong; yet I have been thoroughly shaken lately by an\naccumulation of trouble.”“I presume that a constitution in the susceptible state in which mine\nat present is, would be especially liable to fall a victim to cholera,\nif it visited our district. And since its appearance near London, we\nmay well besiege the Mercy-seat for our protection,” said Mr.\nBulstrode, not intending to evade Lydgate’s allusion, but really\npreoccupied with alarms about himself.“You have at all events taken your share in using good practical\nprecautions for the town, and that is the best mode of asking for\nprotection,” said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken\nmetaphor and bad logic of the banker’s religion, somewhat increased by\nthe apparent deafness of his sympathy. But his mind had taken up its\nlong-prepared movement towards getting help, and was not yet arrested.\nHe added, “The town has done well in the way of cleansing, and finding\nappliances; and I think that if the cholera should come, even our\nenemies will admit that the arrangements in the Hospital are a public\ngood.”“Truly,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with some coldness. “With regard to what\nyou say, Mr. Lydgate, about the relaxation of my mental labor, I have\nfor some time been entertaining a purpose to that effect—a purpose of a\nvery decided character. I contemplate at least a temporary withdrawal\nfrom the management of much business, whether benevolent or commercial.\nAlso I think of changing my residence for a time: probably I shall\nclose or let ‘The Shrubs,’ and take some place near the coast—under\nadvice of course as to salubrity. That would be a measure which you\nwould recommend?”"

  "content": "“Oh yes,” said Lydgate, falling backward in his chair, with\nill-repressed impatience under the banker’s pale earnest eyes and\nintense preoccupation with himself.“I have for some time felt that I should open this subject with you in\nrelation to our Hospital,” continued Bulstrode. “Under the\ncircumstances I have indicated, of course I must cease to have any\npersonal share in the management, and it is contrary to my views of\nresponsibility to continue a large application of means to an\ninstitution which I cannot watch over and to some extent regulate. I\nshall therefore, in case of my ultimate decision to leave Middlemarch,\nconsider that I withdraw other support to the New Hospital than that\nwhich will subsist in the fact that I chiefly supplied the expenses of\nbuilding it, and have contributed further large sums to its successful\nworking.”Lydgate’s thought, when Bulstrode paused according to his wont, was,\n“He has perhaps been losing a good deal of money.” This was the most\nplausible explanation of a speech which had caused rather a startling\nchange in his expectations. He said in reply—“The loss to the Hospital can hardly be made up, I fear.”“Hardly,” returned Bulstrode, in the same deliberate, silvery tone;\n“except by some changes of plan. The only person who may be certainly\ncounted on as willing to increase her contributions is Mrs. Casaubon. I\nhave had an interview with her on the subject, and I have pointed out\nto her, as I am about to do to you, that it will be desirable to win a\nmore general support to the New Hospital by a change of system.”\nAnother pause, but Lydgate did not speak.“The change I mean is an amalgamation with the Infirmary, so that the\nNew Hospital shall be regarded as a special addition to the elder\ninstitution, having the same directing board. It will be necessary,\nalso, that the medical management of the two shall be combined. In this\nway any difficulty as to the adequate maintenance of our new\nestablishment will be removed; the benevolent interests of the town\nwill cease to be divided.”Mr. Bulstrode had lowered his eyes from Lydgate’s face to the buttons\nof his coat as he again paused."

  "content": "“No doubt that is a good device as to ways and means,” said Lydgate,\nwith an edge of irony in his tone. “But I can’t be expected to rejoice\nin it at once, since one of the first results will be that the other\nmedical men will upset or interrupt my methods, if it were only because\nthey are mine.”“I myself, as you know, Mr. Lydgate, highly valued the opportunity of\nnew and independent procedure which you have diligently employed: the\noriginal plan, I confess, was one which I had much at heart, under\nsubmission to the Divine Will. But since providential indications\ndemand a renunciation from me, I renounce.”Bulstrode showed a rather exasperating ability in this conversation.\nThe broken metaphor and bad logic of motive which had stirred his\nhearer’s contempt were quite consistent with a mode of putting the\nfacts which made it difficult for Lydgate to vent his own indignation\nand disappointment. After some rapid reflection, he only asked—“What did Mrs. Casaubon say?”“That was the further statement which I wished to make to you,” said\nBulstrode, who had thoroughly prepared his ministerial explanation.\n“She is, you are aware, a woman of most munificent disposition, and\nhappily in possession—not I presume of great wealth, but of funds which\nshe can well spare. She has informed me that though she has destined\nthe chief part of those funds to another purpose, she is willing to\nconsider whether she cannot fully take my place in relation to the\nHospital. But she wishes for ample time to mature her thoughts on the\nsubject, and I have told her that there is no need for haste—that, in\nfact, my own plans are not yet absolute.”Lydgate was ready to say, “If Mrs. Casaubon would take your place,\nthere would be gain, instead of loss.” But there was still a weight on\nhis mind which arrested this cheerful candor. He replied, “I suppose,\nthen, that I may enter into the subject with Mrs. Casaubon.”"

  "content": "“Precisely; that is what she expressly desires. Her decision, she says,\nwill much depend on what you can tell her. But not at present: she is,\nI believe, just setting out on a journey. I have her letter here,” said\nMr. Bulstrode, drawing it out, and reading from it. “‘I am immediately\notherwise engaged,’ she says. ‘I am going into Yorkshire with Sir James\nand Lady Chettam; and the conclusions I come to about some land which I\nam to see there may affect my power of contributing to the Hospital.’\nThus, Mr. Lydgate, there is no haste necessary in this matter; but I\nwished to apprise you beforehand of what may possibly occur.”Mr. Bulstrode returned the letter to his side-pocket, and changed his\nattitude as if his business were closed. Lydgate, whose renewed hope\nabout the Hospital only made him more conscious of the facts which\npoisoned his hope, felt that his effort after help, if made at all,\nmust be made now and vigorously.“I am much obliged to you for giving me full notice,” he said, with a\nfirm intention in his tone, yet with an interruptedness in his delivery\nwhich showed that he spoke unwillingly. “The highest object to me is my\nprofession, and I had identified the Hospital with the best use I can\nat present make of my profession. But the best use is not always the\nsame with monetary success. Everything which has made the Hospital\nunpopular has helped with other causes—I think they are all connected\nwith my professional zeal—to make me unpopular as a practitioner. I get\nchiefly patients who can’t pay me. I should like them best, if I had\nnobody to pay on my own side.” Lydgate waited a little, but Bulstrode\nonly bowed, looking at him fixedly, and he went on with the same\ninterrupted enunciation—as if he were biting an objectional leek.“I have slipped into money difficulties which I can see no way out of,\nunless some one who trusts me and my future will advance me a sum\nwithout other security. I had very little fortune left when I came\nhere. I have no prospects of money from my own family. My expenses, in\nconsequence of my marriage, have been very much greater than I had\nexpected. The result at this moment is that it would take a thousand\npounds to clear me. I mean, to free me from the risk of having all my\ngoods sold in security of my largest debt—as well as to pay my other\ndebts—and leave anything to keep us a little beforehand with our small\nincome. I find that it is out of the question that my wife’s father\nshould make such an advance. That is why I mention my position to—to\nthe only other man who may be held to have some personal connection\nwith my prosperity or ruin.”"

  "content": "Lydgate hated to hear himself. But he had spoken now, and had spoken\nwith unmistakable directness. Mr. Bulstrode replied without haste, but\nalso without hesitation.“I am grieved, though, I confess, not surprised by this information,\nMr. Lydgate. For my own part, I regretted your alliance with my\nbrother-in-law’s family, which has always been of prodigal habits, and\nwhich has already been much indebted to me for sustainment in its\npresent position. My advice to you, Mr. Lydgate, would be, that instead\nof involving yourself in further obligations, and continuing a doubtful\nstruggle, you should simply become a bankrupt.”“That would not improve my prospect,” said Lydgate, rising and speaking\nbitterly, “even if it were a more agreeable thing in itself.”“It is always a trial,” said Mr. Bulstrode; “but trial, my dear sir, is\nour portion here, and is a needed corrective. I recommend you to weigh\nthe advice I have given.”“Thank you,” said Lydgate, not quite knowing what he said. “I have\noccupied you too long. Good-day.”CHAPTER LXVIII.What suit of grace hath Virtue to put on\nIf Vice shall wear as good, and do as well?\nIf Wrong, if Craft, if Indiscretion\nAct as fair parts with ends as laudable?\nWhich all this mighty volume of events\nThe world, the universal map of deeds,\nStrongly controls, and proves from all descents,\nThat the directest course still best succeeds.\nFor should not grave and learn’d Experience\nThat looks with the eyes of all the world beside,\nAnd with all ages holds intelligence,\nGo safer than Deceit without a guide!\n—DANIEL: _Musophilus_.That change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode stated or\nbetrayed in his conversation with Lydgate, had been determined in him\nby some severe experience which he had gone through since the epoch of\nMr. Larcher’s sale, when Raffles had recognized Will Ladislaw, and when\nthe banker had in vain attempted an act of restitution which might move\nDivine Providence to arrest painful consequences."

  "content": "His certainty that Raffles, unless he were dead, would return to\nMiddlemarch before long, had been justified. On Christmas Eve he had\nreappeared at The Shrubs. Bulstrode was at home to receive him, and\nhinder his communication with the rest of the family, but he could not\naltogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from compromising\nhimself and alarming his wife. Raffles proved more unmanageable than he\nhad shown himself to be in his former appearances, his chronic state of\nmental restlessness, the growing effect of habitual intemperance,\nquickly shaking off every impression from what was said to him. He\ninsisted on staying in the house, and Bulstrode, weighing two sets of\nevils, felt that this was at least not a worse alternative than his\ngoing into the town. He kept him in his own room for the evening and\nsaw him to bed, Raffles all the while amusing himself with the\nannoyance he was causing this decent and highly prosperous\nfellow-sinner, an amusement which he facetiously expressed as sympathy\nwith his friend’s pleasure in entertaining a man who had been\nserviceable to him, and who had not had all his earnings. There was a\ncunning calculation under this noisy joking—a cool resolve to extract\nsomething the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from this\nnew application of torture. But his cunning had a little overcast its\nmark.Bulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of Raffles\ncould enable him to imagine. He had told his wife that he was simply\ntaking care of this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might\notherwise injure himself; he implied, without the direct form of\nfalsehood, that there was a family tie which bound him to this care,\nand that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged\ncaution. He would himself drive the unfortunate being away the next\nmorning. In these hints he felt that he was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode\nwith precautionary information for his daughters and servants, and\naccounting for his allowing no one but himself to enter the room even\nwith food and drink. But he sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should\nbe overheard in his loud and plain references to past facts—lest Mrs.\nBulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door. How could he\nhinder her, how betray his terror by opening the door to detect her?\nShe was a woman of honest direct habits, and little likely to take so\nlow a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge; but fear was\nstronger than the calculation of probabilities."

  "content": "In this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far, and produced an\neffect which had not been in his plan. By showing himself hopelessly\nunmanageable he had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the\nonly resource left. After taking Raffles to bed that night the banker\nordered his closed carriage to be ready at half-past seven the next\nmorning. At six o’clock he had already been long dressed, and had spent\nsome of his wretchedness in prayer, pleading his motives for averting\nthe worst evil if in anything he had used falsity and spoken what was\nnot true before God. For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie with an\nintensity disproportionate to the number of his more indirect misdeeds.\nBut many of these misdeeds were like the subtle muscular movements\nwhich are not taken account of in the consciousness, though they bring\nabout the end that we fix our mind on and desire. And it is only what\nwe are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine to be seen by\nOmniscience.Bulstrode carried his candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was\napparently in a painful dream. He stood silent, hoping that the\npresence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually and\ngently, for he feared some noise as the consequence of a too sudden\nawakening. He had watched for a couple of minutes or more the\nshudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking, when\nRaffles, with a long half-stifled moan, started up and stared round him\nin terror, trembling and gasping. But he made no further noise, and\nBulstrode, setting down the candle, awaited his recovery.It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold\nperemptoriness of manner which he had not before shown, said, “I came\nto call you thus early, Mr. Raffles, because I have ordered the\ncarriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to conduct\nyou as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway or await a\ncoach.” Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode anticipated him\nimperiously with the words, “Be silent, sir, and hear what I have to\nsay. I shall supply you with money now, and I will furnish you with a\nreasonable sum from time to time, on your application to me by letter;\nbut if you choose to present yourself here again, if you return to\nMiddlemarch, if you use your tongue in a manner injurious to me, you\nwill have to live on such fruits as your malice can bring you, without\nhelp from me. Nobody will pay you well for blasting my name: I know the\nworst you can do against me, and I shall brave it if you dare to thrust\nyourself upon me again. Get up, sir, and do as I order you, without\nnoise, or I will send for a policeman to take you off my premises, and\nyou may carry your stories into every pothouse in the town, but you\nshall have no sixpence from me to pay your expenses there.”"

  "content": "Bulstrode had rarely in his life spoken with such nervous energy: he\nhad been deliberating on this speech and its probable effects through a\nlarge part of the night; and though he did not trust to its ultimately\nsaving him from any return of Raffles, he had concluded that it was the\nbest throw he could make. It succeeded in enforcing submission from the\njaded man this morning: his empoisoned system at this moment quailed\nbefore Bulstrode’s cold, resolute bearing, and he was taken off quietly\nin the carriage before the family breakfast time. The servants imagined\nhim to be a poor relation, and were not surprised that a strict man\nlike their master, who held his head high in the world, should be\nashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him. The banker’s drive\nof ten miles with his hated companion was a dreary beginning of the\nChristmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles had recovered his\nspirits, and parted in a contentment for which there was the good\nreason that the banker had given him a hundred pounds. Various motives\nurged Bulstrode to this open-handedness, but he did not himself inquire\nclosely into all of them. As he had stood watching Raffles in his\nuneasy sleep, it had certainly entered his mind that the man had been\nmuch shattered since the first gift of two hundred pounds.He had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his resolve not\nto be played on any more; and had tried to penetrate Raffles with the\nfact that he had shown the risks of bribing him to be quite equal to\nthe risks of defying him. But when, freed from his repulsive presence,\nBulstrode returned to his quiet home, he brought with him no confidence\nthat he had secured more than a respite. It was as if he had had a\nloathsome dream, and could not shake off its images with their hateful\nkindred of sensations—as if on all the pleasant surroundings of his\nlife a dangerous reptile had left his slimy traces.Who can know how much of his most inward life is made up of the\nthoughts he believes other men to have about him, until that fabric of\nopinion is threatened with ruin?"

  "content": "Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of\nuneasy presentiment in his wife’s mind, because she carefully avoided\nany allusion to it. He had been used every day to taste the flavor of\nsupremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the certainty that\nhe was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of his having some\ndiscreditable secret, made his voice totter when he was speaking to\nedification. Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode’s anxious temperament, is\noften worse than seeing; and his imagination continually heightened the\nanguish of an imminent disgrace. Yes, imminent; for if his defiance of\nRaffles did not keep the man away—and though he prayed for this result\nhe hardly hoped for it—the disgrace was certain. In vain he said to\nhimself that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a\nchastisement, a preparation; he recoiled from the imagined burning; and\nhe judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he should\nescape dishonor. That recoil had at last urged him to make preparations\nfor quitting Middlemarch. If evil truth must be reported of him, he\nwould then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt of his old\nneighbors; and in a new scene, where his life would not have gathered\nthe same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if he pursued him, would be\nless formidable. To leave the place finally would, he knew, be\nextremely painful to his wife, and on other grounds he would have\npreferred to stay where he had struck root. Hence he made his\npreparations at first in a conditional way, wishing to leave on all\nsides an opening for his return after brief absence, if any favorable\nintervention of Providence should dissipate his fears. He was preparing\nto transfer his management of the Bank, and to give up any active\ncontrol of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the ground\nof his failing health, but without excluding his future resumption of\nsuch work. The measure would cause him some added expense and some\ndiminution of income beyond what he had already undergone from the\ngeneral depression of trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a\nprincipal object of outlay on which he could fairly economize."

But at this time his arrangements had most of them gone no\nfarther than a stage at which he could recall them if they proved to be\nunnecessary. He continually deferred the final steps; in the midst of\nhis fears, like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being\ndashed from his carriage by runaway horses, he had a clinging\nimpression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and that to\nspoil his life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty—especially\nsince it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his wife for the\nproject of their indefinite exile from the only place where she would\nlike to live.Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management of the\nfarm at Stone Court in case of his absence; and on this as well as on\nall other matters connected with any houses and land he possessed in or\nabout Middlemarch, he had consulted Caleb Garth. Like every one else\nwho had business of that sort, he wanted to get the agent who was more\nanxious for his employer’s interests than his own. With regard to Stone\nCourt, since Bulstrode wished to retain his hold on the stock, and to\nhave an arrangement by which he himself could, if he chose, resume his\nfavorite recreation of superintendence, Caleb had advised him not to\ntrust to a mere bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and implements\nyearly, and take a proportionate share of the proceeds.“May I trust to you to find me a tenant on these terms, Mr. Garth?”\nsaid Bulstrode. “And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would\nrepay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?”“I’ll think about it,” said Caleb, in his blunt way. “I’ll see how I\ncan make it out.”"

  "content": "If it had not been that he had to consider Fred Vincy’s future, Mr.\nGarth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his work, of\nwhich his wife was always fearing an excess for him as he grew older.\nBut on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a very alluring idea\noccurred to him about this said letting of Stone Court. What if\nBulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy there on the\nunderstanding that he, Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the\nmanagement? It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; he might make\na modest income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by\nhelping in other business. He mentioned his notion to Mrs. Garth with\nsuch evident delight that she could not bear to chill his pleasure by\nexpressing her constant fear of his undertaking too much.“The lad would be as happy as two,” he said, throwing himself back in\nhis chair, and looking radiant, “if I could tell him it was all\nsettled. Think; Susan! His mind had been running on that place for\nyears before old Featherstone died. And it would be as pretty a turn of\nthings as could be that he should hold the place in a good industrious\nway after all—by his taking to business. For it’s likely enough\nBulstrode might let him go on, and gradually buy the stock. He hasn’t\nmade up his mind, I can see, whether or not he shall settle somewhere\nelse as a lasting thing. I never was better pleased with a notion in my\nlife. And then the children might be married by-and-by, Susan.”“You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are sure\nthat Bulstrode would agree to the plan?” said Mrs. Garth, in a tone of\ngentle caution. “And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people need not help\nto hasten it.”“Oh, I don’t know,” said Caleb, swinging his head aside. “Marriage is a\ntaming thing. Fred would want less of my bit and bridle. However, I\nshall say nothing till I know the ground I’m treading on. I shall speak\nto Bulstrode again.”"

  "content": "He took his earliest opportunity of doing so. Bulstrode had anything\nbut a warm interest in his nephew Fred Vincy, but he had a strong wish\nto secure Mr. Garth’s services on many scattered points of business at\nwhich he was sure to be a considerable loser, if they were under less\nconscientious management. On that ground he made no objection to Mr.\nGarth’s proposal; and there was also another reason why he was not\nsorry to give a consent which was to benefit one of the Vincy family.\nIt was that Mrs. Bulstrode, having heard of Lydgate’s debts, had been\nanxious to know whether her husband could not do something for poor\nRosamond, and had been much troubled on learning from him that\nLydgate’s affairs were not easily remediable, and that the wisest plan\nwas to let them “take their course.” Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for\nthe first time, “I think you are always a little hard towards my\nfamily, Nicholas. And I am sure I have no reason to deny any of my\nrelatives. Too worldly they may be, but no one ever had to say that\nthey were not respectable.”“My dear Harriet,” said Mr. Bulstrode, wincing under his wife’s eyes,\nwhich were filling with tears, “I have supplied your brother with a\ngreat deal of capital. I cannot be expected to take care of his married\nchildren.”That seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s remonstrance subsided into\npity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education she had always\nforeseen the fruits of.But remembering that dialogue, Mr. Bulstrode felt that when he had to\ntalk to his wife fully about his plan of quitting Middlemarch, he\nshould be glad to tell her that he had made an arrangement which might\nbe for the good of her nephew Fred. At present he had merely mentioned\nto her that he thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months, and\ntaking a house on the Southern Coast.Hence Mr. Garth got the assurance he desired, namely, that in case of\nBulstrode’s departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time, Fred\nVincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms\nproposed.Caleb was so elated with his hope of this “neat turn” being given to\nthings, that if his self-control had not been braced by a little\naffectionate wifely scolding, he would have betrayed everything to\nMary, wanting “to give the child comfort.” However, he restrained\nhimself, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which he\nwas making to Stone Court, in order to look more thoroughly into the\nstate of the land and stock, and take a preliminary estimate. He was\ncertainly more eager in these visits than the probable speed of events\nrequired him to be; but he was stimulated by a fatherly delight in\noccupying his mind with this bit of probable happiness which he held in\nstore like a hidden birthday gift for Fred and Mary.“But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in the\nair?” said Mrs. Garth.“Well, well,” replied Caleb; “the castle will tumble about nobody’s\nhead.”CHAPTER LXIX.“If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee.”\n—_Ecclesiasticus_."

  "content": "Mr. Bulstrode was still seated in his manager’s room at the Bank, about\nthree o’clock of the same day on which he had received Lydgate there,\nwhen the clerk entered to say that his horse was waiting, and also that\nMr. Garth was outside and begged to speak with him.“By all means,” said Bulstrode; and Caleb entered. “Pray sit down, Mr.\nGarth,” continued the banker, in his suavest tone.“I am glad that you arrived just in time to find me here. I know you\ncount your minutes.”“Oh,” said Caleb, gently, with a slow swing of his head on one side, as\nhe seated himself and laid his hat on the floor.He looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting his long fingers\ndroop between his legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if it\nwere sharing some thought which filled his large quiet brow.Mr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to his\nslowness in beginning to speak on any topic which he felt to be\nimportant, and rather expected that he was about to recur to the buying\nof some houses in Blindman’s Court, for the sake of pulling them down,\nas a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of\nair and light on that spot. It was by propositions of this kind that\nCaleb was sometimes troublesome to his employers; but he had usually\nfound Bulstrode ready to meet him in projects of improvement, and they\nhad got on well together. When he spoke again, however, it was to say,\nin rather a subdued voice—“I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode.”“You found nothing wrong there, I hope,” said the banker; “I was there\nmyself yesterday. Abel has done well with the lambs this year.”“Why, yes,” said Caleb, looking up gravely, “there is something wrong—a\nstranger, who is very ill, I think. He wants a doctor, and I came to\ntell you of that. His name is Raffles.”He saw the shock of his words passing through Bulstrode’s frame. On\nthis subject the banker had thought that his fears were too constantly\non the watch to be taken by surprise; but he had been mistaken.“Poor wretch!” he said in a compassionate tone, though his lips\ntrembled a little. “Do you know how he came there?”"

  "content": "“I took him myself,” said Caleb, quietly—“took him up in my gig. He had\ngot down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the turning\nfrom the toll-house, and I overtook him. He remembered seeing me with\nyou once before, at Stone Court, and he asked me to take him on. I saw\nhe was ill: it seemed to me the right thing to do, to carry him under\nshelter. And now I think you should lose no time in getting advice for\nhim.” Caleb took up his hat from the floor as he ended, and rose slowly\nfrom his seat.“Certainly,” said Bulstrode, whose mind was very active at this moment.\n“Perhaps you will yourself oblige me, Mr. Garth, by calling at Mr.\nLydgate’s as you pass—or stay! he may at this hour probably be at the\nHospital. I will first send my man on the horse there with a note this\ninstant, and then I will myself ride to Stone Court.”Bulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out himself to give the\ncommission to his man. When he returned, Caleb was standing as before\nwith one hand on the back of the chair, holding his hat with the other.\nIn Bulstrode’s mind the dominant thought was, “Perhaps Raffles only\nspoke to Garth of his illness. Garth may wonder, as he must have done\nbefore, at this disreputable fellow’s claiming intimacy with me; but he\nwill know nothing. And he is friendly to me—I can be of use to him.”He longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have\nasked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been\nto betray fear.“I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Garth,” he said, in his usual\ntone of politeness. “My servant will be back in a few minutes, and I\nshall then go myself to see what can be done for this unfortunate man.\nPerhaps you had some other business with me? If so, pray be seated.”“Thank you,” said Caleb, making a slight gesture with his right hand to\nwaive the invitation. “I wish to say, Mr. Bulstrode, that I must\nrequest you to put your business into some other hands than mine. I am\nobliged to you for your handsome way of meeting me—about the letting of\nStone Court, and all other business. But I must give it up.” A sharp\ncertainty entered like a stab into Bulstrode’s soul.“This is sudden, Mr. Garth,” was all he could say at first.“It is,” said Caleb; “but it is quite fixed. I must give it up.”"

  "content": "He spoke with a firmness which was very gentle, and yet he could see\nthat Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness, his face looking\ndried and his eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on him.\nCaleb felt a deep pity for him, but he could have used no pretexts to\naccount for his resolve, even if they would have been of any use.“You have been led to this, I apprehend, by some slanders concerning me\nuttered by that unhappy creature,” said Bulstrode, anxious now to know\nthe utmost.“That is true. I can’t deny that I act upon what I heard from him.”“You are a conscientious man, Mr. Garth—a man, I trust, who feels\nhimself accountable to God. You would not wish to injure me by being\ntoo ready to believe a slander,” said Bulstrode, casting about for\npleas that might be adapted to his hearer’s mind. “That is a poor\nreason for giving up a connection which I think I may say will be\nmutually beneficial.”“I would injure no man if I could help it,” said Caleb; “even if I\nthought God winked at it. I hope I should have a feeling for my\nfellow-creature. But, sir—I am obliged to believe that this Raffles has\ntold me the truth. And I can’t be happy in working with you, or\nprofiting by you. It hurts my mind. I must beg you to seek another\nagent.”“Very well, Mr. Garth. But I must at least claim to know the worst that\nhe has told you. I must know what is the foul speech that I am liable\nto be the victim of,” said Bulstrode, a certain amount of anger\nbeginning to mingle with his humiliation before this quiet man who\nrenounced his benefits.“That’s needless,” said Caleb, waving his hand, bowing his head\nslightly, and not swerving from the tone which had in it the merciful\nintention to spare this pitiable man. “What he has said to me will\nnever pass from my lips, unless something now unknown forces it from\nme. If you led a harmful life for gain, and kept others out of their\nrights by deceit, to get the more for yourself, I dare say you\nrepent—you would like to go back, and can’t: that must be a bitter\nthing”—Caleb paused a moment and shook his head—“it is not for me to\nmake your life harder to you.”“But you do—you do make it harder to me,” said Bulstrode constrained\ninto a genuine, pleading cry. “You make it harder to me by turning your\nback on me.”"

  "content": "“That I’m forced to do,” said Caleb, still more gently, lifting up his\nhand. “I am sorry. I don’t judge you and say, he is wicked, and I am\nrighteous. God forbid. I don’t know everything. A man may do wrong, and\nhis will may rise clear out of it, though he can’t get his life clear.\nThat’s a bad punishment. If it is so with you,—well, I’m very sorry for\nyou. But I have that feeling inside me, that I can’t go on working with\nyou. That’s all, Mr. Bulstrode. Everything else is buried, so far as my\nwill goes. And I wish you good-day.”“One moment, Mr. Garth!” said Bulstrode, hurriedly. “I may trust then\nto your solemn assurance that you will not repeat either to man or\nwoman what—even if it have any degree of truth in it—is yet a malicious\nrepresentation?” Caleb’s wrath was stirred, and he said, indignantly—“Why should I have said it if I didn’t mean it? I am in no fear of you.\nSuch tales as that will never tempt my tongue.”“Excuse me—I am agitated—I am the victim of this abandoned man.”“Stop a bit! you have got to consider whether you didn’t help to make\nhim worse, when you profited by his vices.”“You are wronging me by too readily believing him,” said Bulstrode,\noppressed, as by a nightmare, with the inability to deny flatly what\nRaffles might have said; and yet feeling it an escape that Caleb had\nnot so stated it to him as to ask for that flat denial.“No,” said Caleb, lifting his hand deprecatingly; “I am ready to\nbelieve better, when better is proved. I rob you of no good chance. As\nto speaking, I hold it a crime to expose a man’s sin unless I’m clear\nit must be done to save the innocent. That is my way of thinking, Mr.\nBulstrode, and what I say, I’ve no need to swear. I wish you good-day.”Some hours later, when he was at home, Caleb said to his wife,\nincidentally, that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode,\nand that in consequence, he had given up all notion of taking Stone\nCourt, and indeed had resigned doing further business for him.“He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?” said Mrs. Garth,\nimagining that her husband had been touched on his sensitive point, and\nnot been allowed to do what he thought right as to materials and modes\nof work.“Oh,” said Caleb, bowing his head and waving his hand gravely. And Mrs.\nGarth knew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak further\non the subject.As for Bulstrode, he had almost immediately mounted his horse and set\noff for Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate."

  "content": "His mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language\nto his hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations which\nshake our whole system. The deep humiliation with which he had winced\nunder Caleb Garth’s knowledge of his past and rejection of his\npatronage, alternated with and almost gave way to the sense of safety\nin the fact that Garth, and no other, had been the man to whom Raffles\nhad spoken. It seemed to him a sort of earnest that Providence intended\nhis rescue from worse consequences; the way being thus left open for\nthe hope of secrecy. That Raffles should be afflicted with illness,\nthat he should have been led to Stone Court rather than\nelsewhere—Bulstrode’s heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities\nwhich these events conjured up. If it should turn out that he was freed\nfrom all danger of disgrace—if he could breathe in perfect liberty—his\nlife should be more consecrated than it had ever been before. He\nmentally lifted up this vow as if it would urge the result he longed\nfor—he tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful resolution—its\npotency to determine death. He knew that he ought to say, “Thy will be\ndone;” and he said it often. But the intense desire remained that the\nwill of God might be the death of that hated man.Yet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change in\nRaffles without a shock. But for his pallor and feebleness, Bulstrode\nwould have called the change in him entirely mental. Instead of his\nloud tormenting mood, he showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to\ndeprecate Bulstrode’s anger, because the money was all gone—he had been\nrobbed—it had half of it been taken from him. He had only come here\nbecause he was ill and somebody was hunting him—somebody was after him,\nhe had told nobody anything, he had kept his mouth shut. Bulstrode, not\nknowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted this new\nnervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true\nconfessions, and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not\ntold anything, since he had just told the man who took him up in his\ngig and brought him to Stone Court. Raffles denied this with solemn\nadjurations; the fact being that the links of consciousness were\ninterrupted in him, and that his minute terror-stricken narrative to\nCaleb Garth had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which\nhad dropped back into darkness."
