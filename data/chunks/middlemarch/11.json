  "content": "Mrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened it in an instant, thinking\nonly of Fred and not of medical etiquette. Lydgate was only two yards\noff on the other side of some iron palisading, and turned round at the\nsudden sound of the sash, before she called to him. In two minutes he\nwas in the room, and Rosamond went out, after waiting just long enough\nto show a pretty anxiety conflicting with her sense of what was\nbecoming.Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy’s mind insisted\nwith remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance, especially\non what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again. That\nthere might be an awkward affair with Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but\nthe case was serious enough to make him dismiss that consideration: he\nwas convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever,\nand that he had taken just the wrong medicines. He must go to bed\nimmediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and\nprecautions must be used, about which Lydgate was particular. Poor Mrs.\nVincy’s terror at these indications of danger found vent in such words\nas came most easily. She thought it “very ill usage on the part of Mr.\nWrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference to Mr.\nPeacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr. Wrench should\nneglect her children more than others, she could not for the life of\nher understand. He had not neglected Mrs. Larcher’s when they had the\nmeasles, nor indeed would Mrs. Vincy have wished that he should. And if\nanything should happen—”Here poor Mrs. Vincy’s spirit quite broke down, and her Niobe throat\nand good-humored face were sadly convulsed. This was in the hall out of\nFred’s hearing, but Rosamond had opened the drawing-room door, and now\ncame forward anxiously. Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench, said that\nthe symptoms yesterday might have been disguising, and that this form\nof fever was very equivocal in its beginnings: he would go immediately\nto the druggist’s and have a prescription made up in order to lose no\ntime, but he would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him what had been done.“But you must come again—you must go on attending Fred. I can’t have my\nboy left to anybody who may come or not. I bear nobody ill-will, thank\nGod, and Mr. Wrench saved me in the pleurisy, but he’d better have let\nme die—if—if—”"

  "content": "“I will meet Mr. Wrench here, then, shall I?” said Lydgate, really\nbelieving that Wrench was not well prepared to deal wisely with a case\nof this kind.“Pray make that arrangement, Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, coming to her\nmother’s aid, and supporting her arm to lead her away.When Mr. Vincy came home he was very angry with Wrench, and did not\ncare if he never came into his house again. Lydgate should go on now,\nwhether Wrench liked it or not. It was no joke to have fever in the\nhouse. Everybody must be sent to now, not to come to dinner on\nThursday. And Pritchard needn’t get up any wine: brandy was the best\nthing against infection. “I shall drink brandy,” added Mr. Vincy,\nemphatically—as much as to say, this was not an occasion for firing\nwith blank-cartridges. “He’s an uncommonly unfortunate lad, is Fred.\nHe’d need have some luck by and by to make up for all this—else I don’t\nknow who’d have an eldest son.”“Don’t say so, Vincy,” said the mother, with a quivering lip, “if you\ndon’t want him to be taken from me.”“It will worret you to death, Lucy; _that_ I can see,” said Mr. Vincy,\nmore mildly. “However, Wrench shall know what I think of the matter.”\n(What Mr. Vincy thought confusedly was, that the fever might somehow\nhave been hindered if Wrench had shown the proper solicitude about\nhis—the Mayor’s—family.) “I’m the last man to give in to the cry about\nnew doctors, or new parsons either—whether they’re Bulstrode’s men or\nnot. But Wrench shall know what I think, take it as he will.”Wrench did not take it at all well. Lydgate was as polite as he could\nbe in his offhand way, but politeness in a man who has placed you at a\ndisadvantage is only an additional exasperation, especially if he\nhappens to have been an object of dislike beforehand. Country\npractitioners used to be an irritable species, susceptible on the point\nof honor; and Mr. Wrench was one of the most irritable among them. He\ndid not refuse to meet Lydgate in the evening, but his temper was\nsomewhat tried on the occasion. He had to hear Mrs. Vincy say—"

  "content": "“Oh, Mr. Wrench, what have I ever done that you should use me so?— To\ngo away, and never to come again! And my boy might have been stretched\na corpse!”Mr. Vincy, who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy Infection,\nand was a good deal heated in consequence, started up when he heard\nWrench come in, and went into the hall to let him know what he thought.“I’ll tell you what, Wrench, this is beyond a joke,” said the Mayor,\nwho of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official air, and now\nbroadened himself by putting his thumbs in his armholes. “To let fever\nget unawares into a house like this. There are some things that ought\nto be actionable, and are not so— that’s my opinion.”But irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of being\ninstructed, or rather the sense that a younger man, like Lydgate,\ninwardly considered him in need of instruction, for “in point of fact,”\nMr. Wrench afterwards said, Lydgate paraded flighty, foreign notions,\nwhich would not wear. He swallowed his ire for the moment, but he\nafterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case. The house\nmight be a good one, but Mr. Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody\non a professional matter. He reflected, with much probability on his\nside, that Lydgate would by-and-by be caught tripping too, and that his\nungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by his\nprofessional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on himself. He threw out\nbiting remarks on Lydgate’s tricks, worthy only of a quack, to get\nhimself a factitious reputation with credulous people. That cant about\ncures was never got up by sound practitioners.This was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Wrench could\ndesire. To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating, but\nperilous, and not more enviable than the reputation of the\nweather-prophet. He was impatient of the foolish expectations amidst\nwhich all work must be carried on, and likely enough to damage himself\nas much as Mr. Wrench could wish, by an unprofessional openness."

  "content": "However, Lydgate was installed as medical attendant on the Vincys, and\nthe event was a subject of general conversation in Middlemarch. Some\nsaid, that the Vincys had behaved scandalously, that Mr. Vincy had\nthreatened Wrench, and that Mrs. Vincy had accused him of poisoning her\nson. Others were of opinion that Mr. Lydgate’s passing by was\nprovidential, that he was wonderfully clever in fevers, and that\nBulstrode was in the right to bring him forward. Many people believed\nthat Lydgate’s coming to the town at all was really due to Bulstrode;\nand Mrs. Taft, who was always counting stitches and gathered her\ninformation in misleading fragments caught between the rows of her\nknitting, had got it into her head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son\nof Bulstrode’s, a fact which seemed to justify her suspicions of\nevangelical laymen.She one day communicated this piece of knowledge to Mrs. Farebrother,\nwho did not fail to tell her son of it, observing—“I should not be surprised at anything in Bulstrode, but I should be\nsorry to think it of Mr. Lydgate.”“Why, mother,” said Mr. Farebrother, after an explosive laugh, “you\nknow very well that Lydgate is of a good family in the North. He never\nheard of Bulstrode before he came here.”“That is satisfactory so far as Mr. Lydgate is concerned, Camden,” said\nthe old lady, with an air of precision.—“But as to Bulstrode—the report\nmay be true of some other son.”CHAPTER XXVII.Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian:\nWe are but mortals, and must sing of man."

  "content": "An eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify even your ugly\nfurniture by lifting it into the serene light of science, has shown me\nthis pregnant little fact. Your pier-glass or extensive surface of\npolished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and\nmultitudinously scratched in all directions; but place now against it a\nlighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo! the scratches will\nseem to arrange themselves in a fine series of concentric circles round\nthat little sun. It is demonstrable that the scratches are going\neverywhere impartially and it is only your candle which produces the\nflattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light falling with\nan exclusive optical selection. These things are a parable. The\nscratches are events, and the candle is the egoism of any person now\nabsent—of Miss Vincy, for example. Rosamond had a Providence of her own\nwho had kindly made her more charming than other girls, and who seemed\nto have arranged Fred’s illness and Mr. Wrench’s mistake in order to\nbring her and Lydgate within effective proximity. It would have been to\ncontravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to go away to\nStone Court or elsewhere, as her parents wished her to do, especially\nsince Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless. Therefore, while\nMiss Morgan and the children were sent away to a farmhouse the morning\nafter Fred’s illness had declared itself, Rosamond refused to leave\npapa and mamma.Poor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman;\nand Mr. Vincy, who doted on his wife, was more alarmed on her account\nthan on Fred’s. But for his insistence she would have taken no rest:\nher brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her costume which had\nalways been so fresh and gay, she was like a sick bird with languid eye\nand plumage ruffled, her senses dulled to the sights and sounds that\nused most to interest her. Fred’s delirium, in which he seemed to be\nwandering out of her reach, tore her heart. After her first outburst\nagainst Mr. Wrench she went about very quietly: her one low cry was to\nLydgate. She would follow him out of the room and put her hand on his\narm moaning out, “Save my boy.” Once she pleaded, “He has always been\ngood to me, Mr. Lydgate: he never had a hard word for his mother,”—as\nif poor Fred’s suffering were an accusation against him. All the\ndeepest fibres of the mother’s memory were stirred, and the young man\nwhose voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her, was one with the\nbabe whom she had loved, with a love new to her, before he was born."

  "content": "“I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy,” Lydgate would say. “Come down with me\nand let us talk about the food.” In that way he led her to the parlor\nwhere Rosamond was, and made a change for her, surprising her into\ntaking some tea or broth which had been prepared for her. There was a\nconstant understanding between him and Rosamond on these matters. He\nalmost always saw her before going to the sickroom, and she appealed to\nhim as to what she could do for mamma. Her presence of mind and\nadroitness in carrying out his hints were admirable, and it is not\nwonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with\nhis interest in the case. Especially when the critical stage was\npassed, and he began to feel confident of Fred’s recovery. In the more\ndoubtful time, he had advised calling in Dr. Sprague (who, if he could,\nwould rather have remained neutral on Wrench’s account); but after two\nconsultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and there\nwas every reason to make him assiduous. Morning and evening he was at\nMr. Vincy’s, and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became\nsimply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but\nconscious of it, so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if, after all, the illness\nhad made a festival for her tenderness.Both father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits, when\nold Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that Fred must\nmake haste and get well, as he, Peter Featherstone, could not do\nwithout him, and missed his visits sadly. The old man himself was\ngetting bedridden. Mrs. Vincy told these messages to Fred when he could\nlisten, and he turned towards her his delicate, pinched face, from\nwhich all the thick blond hair had been cut away, and in which the eyes\nseemed to have got larger, yearning for some word about Mary—wondering\nwhat she felt about his illness. No word passed his lips; but “to hear\nwith eyes belongs to love’s rare wit,” and the mother in the fulness of\nher heart not only divined Fred’s longing, but felt ready for any\nsacrifice in order to satisfy him.“If I can only see my boy strong again,” she said, in her loving folly;\n“and who knows?—perhaps master of Stone Court! and he can marry anybody\nhe likes then.”“Not if they won’t have me, mother,” said Fred. The illness had made\nhim childish, and tears came as he spoke.“Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, secretly\nincredulous of any such refusal."

  "content": "She never left Fred’s side when her husband was not in the house, and\nthus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much alone. Lydgate,\nnaturally, never thought of staying long with her, yet it seemed that\nthe brief impersonal conversations they had together were creating that\npeculiar intimacy which consists in shyness. They were obliged to look\nat each other in speaking, and somehow the looking could not be carried\nthrough as the matter of course which it really was. Lydgate began to\nfeel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down, or\nanywhere, like an ill-worked puppet. But this turned out badly: the\nnext day, Rosamond looked down, and the consequence was that when their\neyes met again, both were more conscious than before. There was no help\nfor this in science, and as Lydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed\nto be no help for it in folly. It was therefore a relief when neighbors\nno longer considered the house in quarantine, and when the chances of\nseeing Rosamond alone were very much reduced.But that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the\nother is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to\nbe done away with. Talk about the weather and other well-bred topics is\napt to seem a hollow device, and behavior can hardly become easy unless\nit frankly recognizes a mutual fascination—which of course need not\nmean anything deep or serious. This was the way in which Rosamond and\nLydgate slid gracefully into ease, and made their intercourse lively\nagain. Visitors came and went as usual, there was once more music in\nthe drawing-room, and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy’s\nmayoralty returned. Lydgate, whenever he could, took his seat by\nRosamond’s side, and lingered to hear her music, calling himself her\ncaptive—meaning, all the while, not to be her captive. The\npreposterousness of the notion that he could at once set up a\nsatisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee\nagainst danger. This play at being a little in love was agreeable, and\ndid not interfere with graver pursuits. Flirtation, after all, was not\nnecessarily a singeing process. Rosamond, for her part, had never\nenjoyed the days so much in her life before: she was sure of being\nadmired by some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish\nflirtation from love, either in herself or in another. She seemed to be\nsailing with a fair wind just whither she would go, and her thoughts\nwere much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate which she hoped\nwould by-and-by be vacant. She was quite determined, when she was\nmarried, to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors who were not\nagreeable to her at her father’s; and she imagined the drawing-room in\nher favorite house with various styles of furniture."

  "content": "Certainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; he\nseemed to her almost perfect: if he had known his notes so that his\nenchantment under her music had been less like an emotional elephant’s,\nand if he had been able to discriminate better the refinements of her\ntaste in dress, she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him.\nHow different he was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher! Those\nyoung men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject\nwith striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades,\nwhich of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch\ngentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but\nembarrassed in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above\nthem, having at least the accent and manner of a university man.\nWhereas Lydgate was always listened to, bore himself with the careless\npoliteness of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right\nclothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think\nabout them. Rosamond was proud when he entered the room, and when he\napproached her with a distinguishing smile, she had a delicious sense\nthat she was the object of enviable homage. If Lydgate had been aware\nof all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he might have been\njust as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant\nof humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he held it one of the prettiest\nattitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man’s pre-eminence without\ntoo precise a knowledge of what it consisted in. But Rosamond was not\none of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose\nbehavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being\nsteered by wary grace and propriety. Do you imagine that her rapid\nforecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were\never discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma? On the\ncontrary, she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and\ndisapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been\ndetected in that immodest prematureness—indeed, would probably have\ndisbelieved in its possibility. For Rosamond never showed any\nunbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct\nsentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private\nalbum for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the\nirresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no unfair\nevil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or\nmercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as something\nnecessary which other people would always provide. She was not in the\nhabit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements were no direct clew\nto fact, why, they were not intended in that light—they were among her\nelegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature had inspired many\narts in finishing Mrs. Lemon’s favorite pupil, who by general consent\n(Fred’s excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and\namiability."

In fact, they flirted; and Lydgate was\nsecure in the belief that they did nothing else. If a man could not\nlove and be wise, surely he could flirt and be wise at the same time?\nReally, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were great\nbores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards:\nwhat was he to do for relaxation? He was often invited to the\nBulstrodes’; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and\nMrs. Bulstrode’s _naive_ way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the\nnothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the\nconsciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a\nsufficient relief from the weight of her husband’s invariable\nseriousness. The Vincys’ house, with all its faults, was the pleasanter\nby contrast; besides, it nourished Rosamond—sweet to look at as a\nhalf-opened blush-rose, and adorned with accomplishments for the\nrefined amusement of man."

The card-table had drawn off the\nelders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale (one of the good matches in Middlemarch,\nthough not one of its leading minds) was in _tête-à-tête_ with\nRosamond. He had brought the last “Keepsake,” the gorgeous watered-silk\npublication which marked modern progress at that time; and he\nconsidered himself very fortunate that he could be the first to look\nover it with her, dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny\ncopper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic\nverses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting. Rosamond was\ngracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that he had the very best thing in\nart and literature as a medium for “paying addresses”—the very thing to\nplease a nice girl. He had also reasons, deep rather than ostensible,\nfor being satisfied with his own appearance. To superficial observers\nhis chin had too vanishing an aspect, looking as if it were being\ngradually reabsorbed. And it did indeed cause him some difficulty about\nthe fit of his satin stocks, for which chins were at that time useful.“I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,” said Mr. Ned. He\nkept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked at it rather\nlanguishingly.“Her back is very large; she seems to have sat for that,” said\nRosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale’s\nhands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come. She went on with\nher tatting all the while.“I did not say she was as beautiful as you are,” said Mr. Ned,\nventuring to look from the portrait to its rival.“I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer,” said Rosamond, feeling\nsure that she should have to reject this young gentleman a second time.But now Lydgate came in; the book was closed before he reached\nRosamond’s corner, and as he took his seat with easy confidence on the\nother side of her, young Plymdale’s jaw fell like a barometer towards\nthe cheerless side of change. Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate’s\npresence but its effect: she liked to excite jealousy.“What a late comer you are!” she said, as they shook hands. “Mamma had\ngiven you up a little while ago. How do you find Fred?”“As usual; going on well, but slowly. I want him to go away—to Stone\nCourt, for example. But your mamma seems to have some objection.”“Poor fellow!” said Rosamond, prettily. “You will see Fred so changed,”\nshe added, turning to the other suitor; “we have looked to Mr. Lydgate\nas our guardian angel during this illness.”Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the “Keepsake” towards\nhim and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his chin,\nas if in wonderment at human folly.“What are you laughing at so profanely?” said Rosamond, with bland\nneutrality."

  "content": "“I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest—the engravings or the\nwriting here,” said Lydgate, in his most convinced tone, while he\nturned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through the book in\nno time, and showing his large white hands to much advantage, as\nRosamond thought. “Do look at this bridegroom coming out of church: did\nyou ever see such a ‘sugared invention’—as the Elizabethans used to\nsay? Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking? Yet I will answer for\nit the story makes him one of the first gentlemen in the land.”“You are so severe, I am frightened at you,” said Rosamond, keeping her\namusement duly moderate. Poor young Plymdale had lingered with\nadmiration over this very engraving, and his spirit was stirred.“There are a great many celebrated people writing in the ‘Keepsake,’ at\nall events,” he said, in a tone at once piqued and timid. “This is the\nfirst time I have heard it called silly.”“I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a Goth,”\nsaid Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile. “I suspect you know\nnothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.” Rosamond herself was not\nwithout relish for these writers, but she did not readily commit\nherself by admiration, and was alive to the slightest hint that\nanything was not, according to Lydgate, in the very highest taste.“But Sir Walter Scott—I suppose Mr. Lydgate knows him,” said young\nPlymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.“Oh, I read no literature now,” said Lydgate, shutting the book, and\npushing it away. “I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it\nwill last me all my life. I used to know Scott’s poems by heart.”“I should like to know when you left off,” said Rosamond, “because then\nI might be sure that I knew something which you did not know.”“Mr. Lydgate would say that was not worth knowing,” said Mr. Ned,\npurposely caustic.“On the contrary,” said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling with\nexasperating confidence at Rosamond. “It would be worth knowing by the\nfact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.”Young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that\nLydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever\nbeen his ill-fortune to meet.“How rash you are!” said Rosamond, inwardly delighted. “Do you see that\nyou have given offence?”“What! is it Mr. Plymdale’s book? I am sorry. I didn’t think about it.”“I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first came\nhere—that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds.”"

  "content": "“Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she will. Don’t I listen\nto her willingly?”To Rosamond it seemed as if she and Lydgate were as good as engaged.\nThat they were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in her\nmind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of existence, the\nnecessary materials being at hand. It is true, Lydgate had the\ncounter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a mere negative, a\nshadow cast by other resolves which themselves were capable of\nshrinking. Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of Rosamond’s\nidea, which had a shaping activity and looked through watchful blue\neyes, whereas Lydgate’s lay blind and unconcerned as a jelly-fish which\ngets melted without knowing it.That evening when he went home, he looked at his phials to see how a\nprocess of maceration was going on, with undisturbed interest; and he\nwrote out his daily notes with as much precision as usual. The reveries\nfrom which it was difficult for him to detach himself were ideal\nconstructions of something else than Rosamond’s virtues, and the\nprimitive tissue was still his fair unknown. Moreover, he was beginning\nto feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud between\nhim and the other medical men, which was likely to become more\nmanifest, now that Bulstrode’s method of managing the new hospital was\nabout to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his\nnon-acceptance by some of Peacock’s patients might be counterbalanced\nby the impression he had produced in other quarters. Only a few days\nlater, when he had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and\nhad got down from his horse to walk by her side until he had quite\nprotected her from a passing drove, he had been stopped by a servant on\nhorseback with a message calling him in to a house of some importance\nwhere Peacock had never attended; and it was the second instance of\nthis kind. The servant was Sir James Chettam’s, and the house was\nLowick Manor.CHAPTER XXVIII."

Why, true.\n    The calendar hath not an evil day\n    For souls made one by love, and even death\n    Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves\n    While they two clasped each other, and foresaw\n    No life apart.Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon, returning from their wedding journey, arrived at\nLowick Manor in the middle of January. A light snow was falling as they\ndescended at the door, and in the morning, when Dorothea passed from\nher dressing-room into the blue-green boudoir that we know of, she saw\nthe long avenue of limes lifting their trunks from a white earth, and\nspreading white branches against the dun and motionless sky. The\ndistant flat shrank in uniform whiteness and low-hanging uniformity of\ncloud. The very furniture in the room seemed to have shrunk since she\nsaw it before: the stag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in his\nghostly blue-green world; the volumes of polite literature in the\nbookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books. The bright\nfire of dry oak-boughs burning on the logs seemed an incongruous\nrenewal of life and glow—like the figure of Dorothea herself as she\nentered carrying the red-leather cases containing the cameos for Celia.She was glowing from her morning toilet as only healthful youth can\nglow: there was gem-like brightness on her coiled hair and in her hazel\neyes; there was warm red life in her lips; her throat had a breathing\nwhiteness above the differing white of the fur which itself seemed to\nwind about her neck and cling down her blue-gray pelisse with a\ntenderness gathered from her own, a sentient commingled innocence which\nkept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow.\nAs she laid the cameo-cases on the table in the bow-window, she\nunconsciously kept her hands on them, immediately absorbed in looking\nout on the still, white enclosure which made her visible world."

  "content": "Mr. Casaubon, who had risen early complaining of palpitation, was in\nthe library giving audience to his curate Mr. Tucker. By-and-by Celia\nwould come in her quality of bridesmaid as well as sister, and through\nthe next weeks there would be wedding visits received and given; all in\ncontinuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the\nexcitement of bridal felicity, and keeping up the sense of busy\nineffectiveness, as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect. The\nduties of her married life, contemplated as so great beforehand, seemed\nto be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled\nlandscape. The clear heights where she expected to walk in full\ncommunion had become difficult to see even in her imagination; the\ndelicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken\ninto uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment. When would the\ndays begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her\nhusband’s life and exalt her own? Never perhaps, as she had\npreconceived them; but somehow—still somehow. In this solemnly pledged\nunion of her life, duty would present itself in some new form of\ninspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love.Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor—there was\nthe stifling oppression of that gentlewoman’s world, where everything\nwas done for her and none asked for her aid—where the sense of\nconnection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up\npainfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims\nthat would have shaped her energies.— “What shall I do?” “Whatever you\nplease, my dear:” that had been her brief history since she had left\noff learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated\npiano. Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and imperative\noccupation, had not yet freed her from the gentlewoman’s oppressive\nliberty: it had not even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of\nunchecked tenderness. Her blooming full-pulsed youth stood there in a\nmoral imprisonment which made itself one with the chill, colorless,\nnarrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the never-read books,\nand the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that seemed to be\nvanishing from the daylight."

  "content": "In the first minutes when Dorothea looked out she felt nothing but the\ndreary oppression; then came a keen remembrance, and turning away from\nthe window she walked round the room. The ideas and hopes which were\nliving in her mind when she first saw this room nearly three months\nbefore were present now only as memories: she judged them as we judge\ntransient and departed things. All existence seemed to beat with a\nlower pulse than her own, and her religious faith was a solitary cry,\nthe struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and\nshrinking away from her. Each remembered thing in the room was\ndisenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency, till her wandering\ngaze came to the group of miniatures, and there at last she saw\nsomething which had gathered new breath and meaning: it was the\nminiature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt Julia, who had made the unfortunate\nmarriage—of Will Ladislaw’s grandmother. Dorothea could fancy that it\nwas alive now—the delicate woman’s face which yet had a headstrong\nlook, a peculiarity difficult to interpret. Was it only her friends who\nthought her marriage unfortunate? or did she herself find it out to be\na mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the merciful\nsilence of the night? What breadths of experience Dorothea seemed to\nhave passed over since she first looked at this miniature! She felt a\nnew companionship with it, as if it had an ear for her and could see\nhow she was looking at it. Here was a woman who had known some\ndifficulty about marriage. Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and chin\nseemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out light,\nthe face was masculine and beamed on her with that full gaze which\ntells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the\nslightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.\nThe vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea: she felt\nherself smiling, and turning from the miniature sat down and looked up\nas if she were again talking to a figure in front of her. But the smile\ndisappeared as she went on meditating, and at last she said aloud—"

  "content": "“Oh, it was cruel to speak so! How sad—how dreadful!”She rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor,\nwith the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if\nshe could do anything for him. Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr.\nCasaubon was alone in the library. She felt as if all her morning’s\ngloom would vanish if she could see her husband glad because of her\npresence.But when she reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming\nup, and below there was Mr. Brooke, exchanging welcomes and\ncongratulations with Mr. Casaubon.“Dodo!” said Celia, in her quiet staccato; then kissed her sister,\nwhose arms encircled her, and said no more. I think they both cried a\nlittle in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet her\nuncle.“I need not ask how you are, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, after kissing\nher forehead. “Rome has agreed with you, I see—happiness, frescos, the\nantique—that sort of thing. Well, it’s very pleasant to have you back\nagain, and you understand all about art now, eh? But Casaubon is a\nlittle pale, I tell him—a little pale, you know. Studying hard in his\nholidays is carrying it rather too far. I overdid it at one time”—Mr.\nBrooke still held Dorothea’s hand, but had turned his face to Mr.\nCasaubon—“about topography, ruins, temples—I thought I had a clew, but\nI saw it would carry me too far, and nothing might come of it. You may\ngo any length in that sort of thing, and nothing may come of it, you\nknow.”Dorothea’s eyes also were turned up to her husband’s face with some\nanxiety at the idea that those who saw him afresh after absence might\nbe aware of signs which she had not noticed."

  "content": "“Nothing to alarm you, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, observing her\nexpression. “A little English beef and mutton will soon make a\ndifference. It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the portrait\nof Aquinas, you know—we got your letter just in time. But Aquinas,\nnow—he was a little too subtle, wasn’t he? Does anybody read Aquinas?”“He is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds,” said Mr.\nCasaubon, meeting these timely questions with dignified patience.“You would like coffee in your own room, uncle?” said Dorothea, coming\nto the rescue.“Yes; and you must go to Celia: she has great news to tell you, you\nknow. I leave it all to her.”The blue-green boudoir looked much more cheerful when Celia was seated\nthere in a pelisse exactly like her sister’s, surveying the cameos with\na placid satisfaction, while the conversation passed on to other\ntopics.“Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?” said Celia,\nwith her ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on the\nsmallest occasions.“It would not suit all—not you, dear, for example,” said Dorothea,\nquietly. No one would ever know what she thought of a wedding journey\nto Rome.“Mrs. Cadwallader says it is nonsense, people going a long journey when\nthey are married. She says they get tired to death of each other, and\ncan’t quarrel comfortably, as they would at home. And Lady Chettam says\nshe went to Bath.” Celia’s color changed again and again—seemed“To come and go with tidings from the heart,\nAs it a running messenger had been.”It must mean more than Celia’s blushing usually did.“Celia! has something happened?” said Dorothea, in a tone full of\nsisterly feeling. “Have you really any great news to tell me?”“It was because you went away, Dodo. Then there was nobody but me for\nSir James to talk to,” said Celia, with a certain roguishness in her\neyes.“I understand. It is as I used to hope and believe,” said Dorothea,\ntaking her sister’s face between her hands, and looking at her half\nanxiously. Celia’s marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.“It was only three days ago,” said Celia. “And Lady Chettam is very\nkind.”“And you are very happy?”"

He will tell you about them\nwhen he comes. Shall you be glad to see him?”“Of course I shall. How can you ask me?”“Only I was afraid you would be getting so learned,” said Celia,\nregarding Mr. Casaubon’s learning as a kind of damp which might in due\ntime saturate a neighboring body.CHAPTER XXIX.I found that no genius in another could please me.

  "content": "One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why\nalways Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with\nregard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our\neffort at understanding being given to the young skins that look\nblooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will\nknow the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect.\nIn spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia,\nand the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James,\nMr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him, and was\nspiritually a-hungered like the rest of us. He had done nothing\nexceptional in marrying—nothing but what society sanctions, and\nconsiders an occasion for wreaths and bouquets. It had occurred to him\nthat he must not any longer defer his intention of matrimony, and he\nhad reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should\nexpect and carefully choose a blooming young lady—the younger the\nbetter, because more educable and submissive—of a rank equal to his\nown, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good\nunderstanding. On such a young lady he would make handsome settlements,\nand he would neglect no arrangement for her happiness: in return, he\nshould receive family pleasures and leave behind him that copy of\nhimself which seemed so urgently required of a man—to the sonneteers of\nthe sixteenth century. Times had altered since then, and no sonneteer\nhad insisted on Mr. Casaubon’s leaving a copy of himself; moreover, he\nhad not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key; but he\nhad always intended to acquit himself by marriage, and the sense that\nhe was fast leaving the years behind him, that the world was getting\ndimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for losing no more\ntime in overtaking domestic delights before they too were left behind\nby the years.And when he had seen Dorothea he believed that he had found even more\nthan he demanded: she might really be such a helpmate to him as would\nenable him to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid which Mr.\nCasaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of. (Mr.\nCasaubon was nervously conscious that he was expected to manifest a\npowerful mind.) Providence, in its kindness, had supplied him with the\nwife he needed. A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely\nappreciative, unambitious abilities of her sex, is sure to think her\nhusband’s mind powerful. Whether Providence had taken equal care of\nMiss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could\nhardly occur to him. Society never made the preposterous demand that a\nman should think as much about his own qualifications for making a\ncharming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy. As\nif a man could choose not only his wife but his wife’s husband! Or as\nif he were bound to provide charms for his posterity in his own\nperson!— When Dorothea accepted him with effusion, that was only\nnatural; and Mr. Casaubon believed that his happiness was going to\nbegin."

  "content": "He had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life. To\nknow intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an\nenthusiastic soul. Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame,\nand his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too\nlanguid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it\nwent on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking\nof its wings and never flying. His experience was of that pitiable kind\nwhich shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be known:\nit was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to\nspare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in\nsmall currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic\nscrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: he was capable of a\nsevere self-restraint; he was resolute in being a man of honor\naccording to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized\nopinion. In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty of\nmaking his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon\nhis mind; and the pamphlets—or “Parerga” as he called them—by which he\ntested his public and deposited small monumental records of his march,\nwere far from having been seen in all their significance. He suspected\nthe Archdeacon of not having read them; he was in painful doubt as to\nwhat was really thought of them by the leading minds of Brasenose, and\nbitterly convinced that his old acquaintance Carp had been the writer\nof that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in a small drawer\nof Mr. Casaubon’s desk, and also in a dark closet of his verbal memory.\nThese were heavy impressions to struggle against, and brought that\nmelancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all excessive\nclaim: even his religious faith wavered with his wavering trust in his\nown authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in\nimmortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten\nKey to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an\nuneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to\nenjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be\nliberated from a small hungry shivering self—never to be fully\npossessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness\nrapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a\npassion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and\nuninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a\ndean or even a bishop would make little difference, I fear, to Mr.\nCasaubon’s uneasiness. Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that\nbehind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our\npoor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less\nunder anxious control."

  "content": "To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to\nsensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing\nhappiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we\nhave seen, he found himself under a new depression in the consciousness\nthat the new bliss was not blissful to him. Inclination yearned back to\nits old, easier custom. And the deeper he went in domesticity the more\ndid the sense of acquitting himself and acting with propriety\npredominate over any other satisfaction. Marriage, like religion and\nerudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward\nrequirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably\nall requirements. Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study,\naccording to his own intention before marriage, was an effort which he\nwas always tempted to defer, and but for her pleading insistence it\nmight never have begun. But she had succeeded in making it a matter of\ncourse that she should take her place at an early hour in the library\nand have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her. The work\nhad been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate\nintention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph on some\nlately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries whereby\ncertain assertions of Warburton’s could be corrected. References were\nextensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and sentences were\nactually to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by\nBrasenose and a less formidable posterity. These minor monumental\nproductions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion was made\ndifficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry of\ndialectical phrases ringing against each other in his brain. And from\nthe first there was to be a Latin dedication about which everything was\nuncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp: it was a\npoisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once addressed a\ndedication to Carp in which he had numbered that member of the animal\nkingdom among the _viros nullo ævo perituros_, a mistake which would\ninfallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and\nmight even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present."

Celia at this time was on a second visit to\nLowick, probably the last before her marriage, and was in the\ndrawing-room expecting Sir James.Dorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband’s mood, and she\nsaw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour.\nShe was going silently to her desk when he said, in that distant tone\nwhich implied that he was discharging a disagreeable duty—“Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one\naddressed to me.”It was a letter of two pages, and she immediately looked at the\nsignature.“Mr. Ladislaw! What can he have to say to me?” she exclaimed, in a tone\nof pleased surprise. “But,” she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I can\nimagine what he has written to you about.”“You can, if you please, read the letter,” said Mr. Casaubon, severely\npointing to it with his pen, and not looking at her. “But I may as well\nsay beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a\nvisit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of\ncomplete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto\ninevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes\ntheir presence a fatigue.”"
