  "content": "Certainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; he\nseemed to her almost perfect: if he had known his notes so that his\nenchantment under her music had been less like an emotional elephant’s,\nand if he had been able to discriminate better the refinements of her\ntaste in dress, she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him.\nHow different he was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher! Those\nyoung men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject\nwith striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades,\nwhich of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch\ngentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but\nembarrassed in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above\nthem, having at least the accent and manner of a university man.\nWhereas Lydgate was always listened to, bore himself with the careless\npoliteness of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right\nclothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think\nabout them. Rosamond was proud when he entered the room, and when he\napproached her with a distinguishing smile, she had a delicious sense\nthat she was the object of enviable homage. If Lydgate had been aware\nof all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he might have been\njust as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant\nof humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he held it one of the prettiest\nattitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man’s pre-eminence without\ntoo precise a knowledge of what it consisted in. But Rosamond was not\none of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose\nbehavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being\nsteered by wary grace and propriety. Do you imagine that her rapid\nforecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were\never discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma? On the\ncontrary, she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and\ndisapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been\ndetected in that immodest prematureness—indeed, would probably have\ndisbelieved in its possibility. For Rosamond never showed any\nunbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct\nsentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private\nalbum for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the\nirresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no unfair\nevil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or\nmercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as something\nnecessary which other people would always provide. She was not in the\nhabit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements were no direct clew\nto fact, why, they were not intended in that light—they were among her\nelegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature had inspired many\narts in finishing Mrs. Lemon’s favorite pupil, who by general consent\n(Fred’s excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and\namiability."

  "content": "Lydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with her, and there was\nno constraint now, there was a delightful interchange of influence in\ntheir eyes, and what they said had that superfluity of meaning for\nthem, which is observable with some sense of flatness by a third\nperson; still they had no interviews or asides from which a third\nperson need have been excluded. In fact, they flirted; and Lydgate was\nsecure in the belief that they did nothing else. If a man could not\nlove and be wise, surely he could flirt and be wise at the same time?\nReally, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were great\nbores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards:\nwhat was he to do for relaxation? He was often invited to the\nBulstrodes’; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and\nMrs. Bulstrode’s _naive_ way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the\nnothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the\nconsciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a\nsufficient relief from the weight of her husband’s invariable\nseriousness. The Vincys’ house, with all its faults, was the pleasanter\nby contrast; besides, it nourished Rosamond—sweet to look at as a\nhalf-opened blush-rose, and adorned with accomplishments for the\nrefined amusement of man."

The card-table had drawn off the\nelders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale (one of the good matches in Middlemarch,\nthough not one of its leading minds) was in _tête-à-tête_ with\nRosamond. He had brought the last “Keepsake,” the gorgeous watered-silk\npublication which marked modern progress at that time; and he\nconsidered himself very fortunate that he could be the first to look\nover it with her, dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny\ncopper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic\nverses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting. Rosamond was\ngracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that he had the very best thing in\nart and literature as a medium for “paying addresses”—the very thing to\nplease a nice girl. He had also reasons, deep rather than ostensible,\nfor being satisfied with his own appearance. To superficial observers\nhis chin had too vanishing an aspect, looking as if it were being\ngradually reabsorbed. And it did indeed cause him some difficulty about\nthe fit of his satin stocks, for which chins were at that time useful.“I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,” said Mr. Ned. He\nkept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked at it rather\nlanguishingly.“Her back is very large; she seems to have sat for that,” said\nRosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale’s\nhands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come. She went on with\nher tatting all the while.“I did not say she was as beautiful as you are,” said Mr. Ned,\nventuring to look from the portrait to its rival.“I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer,” said Rosamond, feeling\nsure that she should have to reject this young gentleman a second time.But now Lydgate came in; the book was closed before he reached\nRosamond’s corner, and as he took his seat with easy confidence on the\nother side of her, young Plymdale’s jaw fell like a barometer towards\nthe cheerless side of change. Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate’s\npresence but its effect: she liked to excite jealousy.“What a late comer you are!” she said, as they shook hands. “Mamma had\ngiven you up a little while ago. How do you find Fred?”“As usual; going on well, but slowly. I want him to go away—to Stone\nCourt, for example. But your mamma seems to have some objection.”“Poor fellow!” said Rosamond, prettily. “You will see Fred so changed,”\nshe added, turning to the other suitor; “we have looked to Mr. Lydgate\nas our guardian angel during this illness.”Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the “Keepsake” towards\nhim and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his chin,\nas if in wonderment at human folly.“What are you laughing at so profanely?” said Rosamond, with bland\nneutrality."

  "content": "“I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest—the engravings or the\nwriting here,” said Lydgate, in his most convinced tone, while he\nturned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through the book in\nno time, and showing his large white hands to much advantage, as\nRosamond thought. “Do look at this bridegroom coming out of church: did\nyou ever see such a ‘sugared invention’—as the Elizabethans used to\nsay? Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking? Yet I will answer for\nit the story makes him one of the first gentlemen in the land.”“You are so severe, I am frightened at you,” said Rosamond, keeping her\namusement duly moderate. Poor young Plymdale had lingered with\nadmiration over this very engraving, and his spirit was stirred.“There are a great many celebrated people writing in the ‘Keepsake,’ at\nall events,” he said, in a tone at once piqued and timid. “This is the\nfirst time I have heard it called silly.”“I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a Goth,”\nsaid Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile. “I suspect you know\nnothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.” Rosamond herself was not\nwithout relish for these writers, but she did not readily commit\nherself by admiration, and was alive to the slightest hint that\nanything was not, according to Lydgate, in the very highest taste.“But Sir Walter Scott—I suppose Mr. Lydgate knows him,” said young\nPlymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.“Oh, I read no literature now,” said Lydgate, shutting the book, and\npushing it away. “I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it\nwill last me all my life. I used to know Scott’s poems by heart.”“I should like to know when you left off,” said Rosamond, “because then\nI might be sure that I knew something which you did not know.”“Mr. Lydgate would say that was not worth knowing,” said Mr. Ned,\npurposely caustic.“On the contrary,” said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling with\nexasperating confidence at Rosamond. “It would be worth knowing by the\nfact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.”Young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that\nLydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever\nbeen his ill-fortune to meet.“How rash you are!” said Rosamond, inwardly delighted. “Do you see that\nyou have given offence?”“What! is it Mr. Plymdale’s book? I am sorry. I didn’t think about it.”“I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first came\nhere—that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds.”"

  "content": "“Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she will. Don’t I listen\nto her willingly?”To Rosamond it seemed as if she and Lydgate were as good as engaged.\nThat they were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in her\nmind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of existence, the\nnecessary materials being at hand. It is true, Lydgate had the\ncounter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a mere negative, a\nshadow cast by other resolves which themselves were capable of\nshrinking. Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of Rosamond’s\nidea, which had a shaping activity and looked through watchful blue\neyes, whereas Lydgate’s lay blind and unconcerned as a jelly-fish which\ngets melted without knowing it.That evening when he went home, he looked at his phials to see how a\nprocess of maceration was going on, with undisturbed interest; and he\nwrote out his daily notes with as much precision as usual. The reveries\nfrom which it was difficult for him to detach himself were ideal\nconstructions of something else than Rosamond’s virtues, and the\nprimitive tissue was still his fair unknown. Moreover, he was beginning\nto feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud between\nhim and the other medical men, which was likely to become more\nmanifest, now that Bulstrode’s method of managing the new hospital was\nabout to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his\nnon-acceptance by some of Peacock’s patients might be counterbalanced\nby the impression he had produced in other quarters. Only a few days\nlater, when he had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and\nhad got down from his horse to walk by her side until he had quite\nprotected her from a passing drove, he had been stopped by a servant on\nhorseback with a message calling him in to a house of some importance\nwhere Peacock had never attended; and it was the second instance of\nthis kind. The servant was Sir James Chettam’s, and the house was\nLowick Manor.CHAPTER XXVIII."

Why, true.\n    The calendar hath not an evil day\n    For souls made one by love, and even death\n    Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves\n    While they two clasped each other, and foresaw\n    No life apart.Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon, returning from their wedding journey, arrived at\nLowick Manor in the middle of January. A light snow was falling as they\ndescended at the door, and in the morning, when Dorothea passed from\nher dressing-room into the blue-green boudoir that we know of, she saw\nthe long avenue of limes lifting their trunks from a white earth, and\nspreading white branches against the dun and motionless sky. The\ndistant flat shrank in uniform whiteness and low-hanging uniformity of\ncloud. The very furniture in the room seemed to have shrunk since she\nsaw it before: the stag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in his\nghostly blue-green world; the volumes of polite literature in the\nbookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books. The bright\nfire of dry oak-boughs burning on the logs seemed an incongruous\nrenewal of life and glow—like the figure of Dorothea herself as she\nentered carrying the red-leather cases containing the cameos for Celia.She was glowing from her morning toilet as only healthful youth can\nglow: there was gem-like brightness on her coiled hair and in her hazel\neyes; there was warm red life in her lips; her throat had a breathing\nwhiteness above the differing white of the fur which itself seemed to\nwind about her neck and cling down her blue-gray pelisse with a\ntenderness gathered from her own, a sentient commingled innocence which\nkept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow.\nAs she laid the cameo-cases on the table in the bow-window, she\nunconsciously kept her hands on them, immediately absorbed in looking\nout on the still, white enclosure which made her visible world."

  "content": "Mr. Casaubon, who had risen early complaining of palpitation, was in\nthe library giving audience to his curate Mr. Tucker. By-and-by Celia\nwould come in her quality of bridesmaid as well as sister, and through\nthe next weeks there would be wedding visits received and given; all in\ncontinuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the\nexcitement of bridal felicity, and keeping up the sense of busy\nineffectiveness, as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect. The\nduties of her married life, contemplated as so great beforehand, seemed\nto be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled\nlandscape. The clear heights where she expected to walk in full\ncommunion had become difficult to see even in her imagination; the\ndelicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken\ninto uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment. When would the\ndays begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her\nhusband’s life and exalt her own? Never perhaps, as she had\npreconceived them; but somehow—still somehow. In this solemnly pledged\nunion of her life, duty would present itself in some new form of\ninspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love.Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor—there was\nthe stifling oppression of that gentlewoman’s world, where everything\nwas done for her and none asked for her aid—where the sense of\nconnection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up\npainfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims\nthat would have shaped her energies.— “What shall I do?” “Whatever you\nplease, my dear:” that had been her brief history since she had left\noff learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated\npiano. Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and imperative\noccupation, had not yet freed her from the gentlewoman’s oppressive\nliberty: it had not even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of\nunchecked tenderness. Her blooming full-pulsed youth stood there in a\nmoral imprisonment which made itself one with the chill, colorless,\nnarrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the never-read books,\nand the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that seemed to be\nvanishing from the daylight."

  "content": "In the first minutes when Dorothea looked out she felt nothing but the\ndreary oppression; then came a keen remembrance, and turning away from\nthe window she walked round the room. The ideas and hopes which were\nliving in her mind when she first saw this room nearly three months\nbefore were present now only as memories: she judged them as we judge\ntransient and departed things. All existence seemed to beat with a\nlower pulse than her own, and her religious faith was a solitary cry,\nthe struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and\nshrinking away from her. Each remembered thing in the room was\ndisenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency, till her wandering\ngaze came to the group of miniatures, and there at last she saw\nsomething which had gathered new breath and meaning: it was the\nminiature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt Julia, who had made the unfortunate\nmarriage—of Will Ladislaw’s grandmother. Dorothea could fancy that it\nwas alive now—the delicate woman’s face which yet had a headstrong\nlook, a peculiarity difficult to interpret. Was it only her friends who\nthought her marriage unfortunate? or did she herself find it out to be\na mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the merciful\nsilence of the night? What breadths of experience Dorothea seemed to\nhave passed over since she first looked at this miniature! She felt a\nnew companionship with it, as if it had an ear for her and could see\nhow she was looking at it. Here was a woman who had known some\ndifficulty about marriage. Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and chin\nseemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out light,\nthe face was masculine and beamed on her with that full gaze which\ntells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the\nslightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.\nThe vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea: she felt\nherself smiling, and turning from the miniature sat down and looked up\nas if she were again talking to a figure in front of her. But the smile\ndisappeared as she went on meditating, and at last she said aloud—"

How sad—how dreadful!”She rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor,\nwith the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if\nshe could do anything for him. Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr.\nCasaubon was alone in the library. She felt as if all her morning’s\ngloom would vanish if she could see her husband glad because of her\npresence.But when she reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming\nup, and below there was Mr. Brooke, exchanging welcomes and\ncongratulations with Mr. Casaubon.“Dodo!” said Celia, in her quiet staccato; then kissed her sister,\nwhose arms encircled her, and said no more. I think they both cried a\nlittle in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet her\nuncle.“I need not ask how you are, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, after kissing\nher forehead. “Rome has agreed with you, I see—happiness, frescos, the\nantique—that sort of thing. Well, it’s very pleasant to have you back\nagain, and you understand all about art now, eh? But Casaubon is a\nlittle pale, I tell him—a little pale, you know. Studying hard in his\nholidays is carrying it rather too far. I overdid it at one time”—Mr.\nBrooke still held Dorothea’s hand, but had turned his face to Mr.\nCasaubon—“about topography, ruins, temples—I thought I had a clew, but\nI saw it would carry me too far, and nothing might come of it. You may\ngo any length in that sort of thing, and nothing may come of it, you\nknow.”Dorothea’s eyes also were turned up to her husband’s face with some\nanxiety at the idea that those who saw him afresh after absence might\nbe aware of signs which she had not noticed."

It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the portrait\nof Aquinas, you know—we got your letter just in time. But Aquinas,\nnow—he was a little too subtle, wasn’t he? Does anybody read Aquinas?”“He is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds,” said Mr.\nCasaubon, meeting these timely questions with dignified patience.“You would like coffee in your own room, uncle?” said Dorothea, coming\nto the rescue.“Yes; and you must go to Celia: she has great news to tell you, you\nknow. I leave it all to her.”The blue-green boudoir looked much more cheerful when Celia was seated\nthere in a pelisse exactly like her sister’s, surveying the cameos with\na placid satisfaction, while the conversation passed on to other\ntopics.“Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?” said Celia,\nwith her ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on the\nsmallest occasions.“It would not suit all—not you, dear, for example,” said Dorothea,\nquietly. No one would ever know what she thought of a wedding journey\nto Rome.“Mrs. Cadwallader says it is nonsense, people going a long journey when\nthey are married. She says they get tired to death of each other, and\ncan’t quarrel comfortably, as they would at home. And Lady Chettam says\nshe went to Bath.” Celia’s color changed again and again—seemed“To come and go with tidings from the heart,\nAs it a running messenger had been.”It must mean more than Celia’s blushing usually did.“Celia! has something happened?” said Dorothea, in a tone full of\nsisterly feeling. “Have you really any great news to tell me?”“It was because you went away, Dodo. Then there was nobody but me for\nSir James to talk to,” said Celia, with a certain roguishness in her\neyes.“I understand. It is as I used to hope and believe,” said Dorothea,\ntaking her sister’s face between her hands, and looking at her half\nanxiously. Celia’s marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.“It was only three days ago,” said Celia. “And Lady Chettam is very\nkind.”“And you are very happy?”"

  "content": "One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why\nalways Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with\nregard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our\neffort at understanding being given to the young skins that look\nblooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will\nknow the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect.\nIn spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia,\nand the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James,\nMr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him, and was\nspiritually a-hungered like the rest of us. He had done nothing\nexceptional in marrying—nothing but what society sanctions, and\nconsiders an occasion for wreaths and bouquets. It had occurred to him\nthat he must not any longer defer his intention of matrimony, and he\nhad reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should\nexpect and carefully choose a blooming young lady—the younger the\nbetter, because more educable and submissive—of a rank equal to his\nown, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good\nunderstanding. On such a young lady he would make handsome settlements,\nand he would neglect no arrangement for her happiness: in return, he\nshould receive family pleasures and leave behind him that copy of\nhimself which seemed so urgently required of a man—to the sonneteers of\nthe sixteenth century. Times had altered since then, and no sonneteer\nhad insisted on Mr. Casaubon’s leaving a copy of himself; moreover, he\nhad not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key; but he\nhad always intended to acquit himself by marriage, and the sense that\nhe was fast leaving the years behind him, that the world was getting\ndimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for losing no more\ntime in overtaking domestic delights before they too were left behind\nby the years.And when he had seen Dorothea he believed that he had found even more\nthan he demanded: she might really be such a helpmate to him as would\nenable him to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid which Mr.\nCasaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of. (Mr.\nCasaubon was nervously conscious that he was expected to manifest a\npowerful mind.) Providence, in its kindness, had supplied him with the\nwife he needed. A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely\nappreciative, unambitious abilities of her sex, is sure to think her\nhusband’s mind powerful. Whether Providence had taken equal care of\nMiss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could\nhardly occur to him. Society never made the preposterous demand that a\nman should think as much about his own qualifications for making a\ncharming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy. As\nif a man could choose not only his wife but his wife’s husband! Or as\nif he were bound to provide charms for his posterity in his own\nperson!— When Dorothea accepted him with effusion, that was only\nnatural; and Mr. Casaubon believed that his happiness was going to\nbegin."

  "content": "He had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life. To\nknow intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an\nenthusiastic soul. Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame,\nand his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too\nlanguid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it\nwent on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking\nof its wings and never flying. His experience was of that pitiable kind\nwhich shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be known:\nit was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to\nspare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in\nsmall currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic\nscrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: he was capable of a\nsevere self-restraint; he was resolute in being a man of honor\naccording to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized\nopinion. In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty of\nmaking his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon\nhis mind; and the pamphlets—or “Parerga” as he called them—by which he\ntested his public and deposited small monumental records of his march,\nwere far from having been seen in all their significance. He suspected\nthe Archdeacon of not having read them; he was in painful doubt as to\nwhat was really thought of them by the leading minds of Brasenose, and\nbitterly convinced that his old acquaintance Carp had been the writer\nof that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in a small drawer\nof Mr. Casaubon’s desk, and also in a dark closet of his verbal memory.\nThese were heavy impressions to struggle against, and brought that\nmelancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all excessive\nclaim: even his religious faith wavered with his wavering trust in his\nown authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in\nimmortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten\nKey to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an\nuneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to\nenjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be\nliberated from a small hungry shivering self—never to be fully\npossessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness\nrapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a\npassion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and\nuninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a\ndean or even a bishop would make little difference, I fear, to Mr.\nCasaubon’s uneasiness. Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that\nbehind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our\npoor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less\nunder anxious control."

  "content": "To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to\nsensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing\nhappiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we\nhave seen, he found himself under a new depression in the consciousness\nthat the new bliss was not blissful to him. Inclination yearned back to\nits old, easier custom. And the deeper he went in domesticity the more\ndid the sense of acquitting himself and acting with propriety\npredominate over any other satisfaction. Marriage, like religion and\nerudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward\nrequirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably\nall requirements. Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study,\naccording to his own intention before marriage, was an effort which he\nwas always tempted to defer, and but for her pleading insistence it\nmight never have begun. But she had succeeded in making it a matter of\ncourse that she should take her place at an early hour in the library\nand have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her. The work\nhad been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate\nintention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph on some\nlately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries whereby\ncertain assertions of Warburton’s could be corrected. References were\nextensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and sentences were\nactually to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by\nBrasenose and a less formidable posterity. These minor monumental\nproductions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion was made\ndifficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry of\ndialectical phrases ringing against each other in his brain. And from\nthe first there was to be a Latin dedication about which everything was\nuncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp: it was a\npoisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once addressed a\ndedication to Carp in which he had numbered that member of the animal\nkingdom among the _viros nullo ævo perituros_, a mistake which would\ninfallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and\nmight even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present."

Celia at this time was on a second visit to\nLowick, probably the last before her marriage, and was in the\ndrawing-room expecting Sir James.Dorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband’s mood, and she\nsaw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour.\nShe was going silently to her desk when he said, in that distant tone\nwhich implied that he was discharging a disagreeable duty—“Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one\naddressed to me.”It was a letter of two pages, and she immediately looked at the\nsignature.“Mr. Ladislaw! What can he have to say to me?” she exclaimed, in a tone\nof pleased surprise. “But,” she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I can\nimagine what he has written to you about.”“You can, if you please, read the letter,” said Mr. Casaubon, severely\npointing to it with his pen, and not looking at her. “But I may as well\nsay beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a\nvisit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of\ncomplete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto\ninevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes\ntheir presence a fatigue.”"

  "content": "There had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and her husband\nsince that little explosion in Rome, which had left such strong traces\nin her mind that it had been easier ever since to quell emotion than to\nincur the consequence of venting it. But this ill-tempered anticipation\nthat she could desire visits which might be disagreeable to her\nhusband, this gratuitous defence of himself against selfish complaint\non her part, was too sharp a sting to be meditated on until after it\nhad been resented. Dorothea had thought that she could have been\npatient with John Milton, but she had never imagined him behaving in\nthis way; and for a moment Mr. Casaubon seemed to be stupidly\nundiscerning and odiously unjust. Pity, that “new-born babe” which was\nby-and-by to rule many a storm within her, did not “stride the blast”\non this occasion. With her first words, uttered in a tone that shook\nhim, she startled Mr. Casaubon into looking at her, and meeting the\nflash of her eyes.“Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?\nYou speak to me as if I were something you had to contend against. Wait\nat least till I appear to consult my own pleasure apart from yours.”“Dorothea, you are hasty,” answered Mr. Casaubon, nervously.Decidedly, this woman was too young to be on the formidable level of\nwifehood—unless she had been pale and featureless and taken everything\nfor granted.“I think it was you who were first hasty in your false suppositions\nabout my feeling,” said Dorothea, in the same tone. The fire was not\ndissipated yet, and she thought it was ignoble in her husband not to\napologize to her.“We will, if you please, say no more on this subject, Dorothea. I have\nneither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate.”Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return to his\nwriting, though his hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be\nwritten in an unknown character. There are answers which, in turning\naway wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a\ndiscussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own\nside is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy."

  "content": "Dorothea left Ladislaw’s two letters unread on her husband’s\nwriting-table and went to her own place, the scorn and indignation\nwithin her rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away\nany trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean\ncupidity. She did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her\nhusband’s bad temper about these letters: she only knew that they had\ncaused him to offend her. She began to work at once, and her hand did\nnot tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the quotations which had\nbeen given to her the day before, she felt that she was forming her\nletters beautifully, and it seemed to her that she saw the construction\nof the Latin she was copying, and which she was beginning to\nunderstand, more clearly than usual. In her indignation there was a\nsense of superiority, but it went out for the present in firmness of\nstroke, and did not compress itself into an inward articulate voice\npronouncing the once “affable archangel” a poor creature.There had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and Dorothea had\nnot looked away from her own table, when she heard the loud bang of a\nbook on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library\nsteps clinging forward as if he were in some bodily distress. She\nstarted up and bounded towards him in an instant: he was evidently in\ngreat straits for breath. Jumping on a stool she got close to his elbow\nand said with her whole soul melted into tender alarm—“Can you lean on me, dear?”He was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to her,\nunable to speak or move, gasping for breath. When at last he descended\nthe three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had\ndrawn close to the foot of the ladder, he no longer gasped but seemed\nhelpless and about to faint. Dorothea rang the bell violently, and\npresently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch: he did not faint, and\nwas gradually reviving, when Sir James Chettam came in, having been met\nin the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had “had a fit in the\nlibrary.”“Good God! this is just what might have been expected,” was his\nimmediate thought. If his prophetic soul had been urged to\nparticularize, it seemed to him that “fits” would have been the\ndefinite expression alighted upon. He asked his informant, the butler,\nwhether the doctor had been sent for. The butler never knew his master\nto want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a\nphysician?When Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make\nsome signs of his usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction\nfrom her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his side now\nrose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical\nman.“I recommend you to send for Lydgate,” said Sir James. “My mother has\ncalled him in, and she has found him uncommonly clever. She has had a\npoor opinion of the physicians since my father’s death.”"

So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he came wonderfully soon, for\nthe messenger, who was Sir James Chettam’s man and knew Mr. Lydgate,\nmet him leading his horse along the Lowick road and giving his arm to\nMiss Vincy.Celia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir\nJames told her of it. After Dorothea’s account, he no longer considered\nthe illness a fit, but still something “of that nature.”“Poor dear Dodo—how dreadful!” said Celia, feeling as much grieved as\nher own perfect happiness would allow. Her little hands were clasped,\nand enclosed by Sir James’s as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx.\n“It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be ill; but I never did\nlike him. And I think he is not half fond enough of Dorothea; and he\nought to be, for I am sure no one else would have had him—do you think\nthey would?”“I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister,” said Sir\nJames.“Yes. But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I think she\nnever will.”“She is a noble creature,” said the loyal-hearted Sir James. He had\njust had a fresh impression of this kind, as he had seen Dorothea\nstretching her tender arm under her husband’s neck and looking at him\nwith unspeakable sorrow. He did not know how much penitence there was\nin the sorrow.“Yes,” said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so,\nbut _he_ would not have been comfortable with Dodo. “Shall I go to her?\nCould I help her, do you think?”“I think it would be well for you just to go and see her before Lydgate\ncomes,” said Sir James, magnanimously. “Only don’t stay long.”"

If Cadwallader—if every one\nelse had regarded the affair as he, Sir James, had done, the marriage\nmight have been hindered. It was wicked to let a young girl blindly\ndecide her fate in that way, without any effort to save her. Sir James\nhad long ceased to have any regrets on his own account: his heart was\nsatisfied with his engagement to Celia. But he had a chivalrous nature\n(was not the disinterested service of woman among the ideal glories of\nold chivalry?): his disregarded love had not turned to bitterness; its\ndeath had made sweet odors—floating memories that clung with a\nconsecrating effect to Dorothea. He could remain her brotherly friend,\ninterpreting her actions with generous trustfulness.CHAPTER XXX.Qui veut délasser hors de propos, lasse.—PASCAL.Mr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first, and\nin a few days began to recover his usual condition. But Lydgate seemed\nto think the case worth a great deal of attention. He not only used his\nstethoscope (which had not become a matter of course in practice at\nthat time), but sat quietly by his patient and watched him. To Mr.\nCasaubon’s questions about himself, he replied that the source of the\nillness was the common error of intellectual men—a too eager and\nmonotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied with moderate\nwork, and to seek variety of relaxation. Mr. Brooke, who sat by on one\noccasion, suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing, as Cadwallader\ndid, and have a turning-room, make toys, table-legs, and that kind of\nthing.“In short, you recommend me to anticipate the arrival of my second\nchildhood,” said poor Mr. Casaubon, with some bitterness. “These\nthings,” he added, looking at Lydgate, “would be to me such relaxation\nas tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction.”“I confess,” said Lydgate, smiling, “amusement is rather an\nunsatisfactory prescription. It is something like telling people to\nkeep up their spirits. Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit\nto be mildly bored rather than to go on working.”"

  "content": "“Yes, yes,” said Mr. Brooke. “Get Dorothea to play backgammon with you\nin the evenings. And shuttlecock, now—I don’t know a finer game than\nshuttlecock for the daytime. I remember it all the fashion. To be sure,\nyour eyes might not stand that, Casaubon. But you must unbend, you\nknow. Why, you might take to some light study: conchology, now: I\nalways think that must be a light study. Or get Dorothea to read you\nlight things, Smollett—‘Roderick Random,’ ‘Humphrey Clinker:’ they are\na little broad, but she may read anything now she’s married, you know.\nI remember they made me laugh uncommonly—there’s a droll bit about a\npostilion’s breeches. We have no such humor now. I have gone through\nall these things, but they might be rather new to you.”“As new as eating thistles,” would have been an answer to represent Mr.\nCasaubon’s feelings. But he only bowed resignedly, with due respect to\nhis wife’s uncle, and observed that doubtless the works he mentioned\nhad “served as a resource to a certain order of minds.”“You see,” said the able magistrate to Lydgate, when they were outside\nthe door, “Casaubon has been a little narrow: it leaves him rather at a\nloss when you forbid him his particular work, which I believe is\nsomething very deep indeed—in the line of research, you know. I would\nnever give way to that; I was always versatile. But a clergyman is tied\na little tight. If they would make him a bishop, now!—he did a very\ngood pamphlet for Peel. He would have more movement then, more show; he\nmight get a little flesh. But I recommend you to talk to Mrs. Casaubon.\nShe is clever enough for anything, is my niece. Tell her, her husband\nwants liveliness, diversion: put her on amusing tactics.”Without Mr. Brooke’s advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to\nDorothea. She had not been present while her uncle was throwing out his\npleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might be\nenlivened, but she was usually by her husband’s side, and the\nunaffected signs of intense anxiety in her face and voice about\nwhatever touched his mind or health, made a drama which Lydgate was\ninclined to watch. He said to himself that he was only doing right in\ntelling her the truth about her husband’s probable future, but he\ncertainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk\nconfidentially with her. A medical man likes to make psychological\nobservations, and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too\neasily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set\nat nought. Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous\nprediction, and he meant now to be guarded."

When Lydgate begged to speak with\nher alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the\nnearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what he might have to\nsay about Mr. Casaubon. It was the first time she had entered this room\nsince her husband had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen not to\nopen the shutters. But there was light enough to read by from the\nnarrow upper panes of the windows.“You will not mind this sombre light,” said Dorothea, standing in the\nmiddle of the room. “Since you forbade books, the library has been out\nof the question. But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope. Is\nhe not making progress?”“Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected. Indeed, he is\nalready nearly in his usual state of health.”“You do not fear that the illness will return?” said Dorothea, whose\nquick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate’s tone.“Such cases are peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon,” said Lydgate.\n“The only point on which I can be confident is that it will be\ndesirable to be very watchful on Mr. Casaubon’s account, lest he should\nin any way strain his nervous power.”“I beseech you to speak quite plainly,” said Dorothea, in an imploring\ntone. “I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I did\nnot know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act\ndifferently.” The words came out like a cry: it was evident that they\nwere the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.“Sit down,” she added, placing herself on the nearest chair, and\nthrowing off her bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of\nformality where a great question of destiny was concerned.“What you say now justifies my own view,” said Lydgate. “I think it is\none’s function as a medical man to hinder regrets of that sort as far\nas possible. But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon’s case is\nprecisely of the kind in which the issue is most difficult to pronounce\nupon. He may possibly live for fifteen years or more, without much\nworse health than he has had hitherto.”Dorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused she said in a\nlow voice, “You mean if we are very careful.”“Yes—careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against\nexcessive application.”“He would be miserable, if he had to give up his work,” said Dorothea,\nwith a quick prevision of that wretchedness."

With a happy\nconcurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger\nfrom that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the\ncause of his late attack. On the other hand, it is possible that the\ndisease may develop itself more rapidly: it is one of those cases in\nwhich death is sometimes sudden. Nothing should be neglected which\nmight be affected by such an issue.”There was silence for a few moments, while Dorothea sat as if she had\nbeen turned to marble, though the life within her was so intense that\nher mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of\nscenes and motives.“Help me, pray,” she said, at last, in the same low voice as before.\n“Tell me what I can do.”“What do you think of foreign travel? You have been lately in Rome, I\nthink.”The memories which made this resource utterly hopeless were a new\ncurrent that shook Dorothea out of her pallid immobility.“Oh, that would not do—that would be worse than anything,” she said\nwith a more childlike despondency, while the tears rolled down.\n“Nothing will be of any use that he does not enjoy.”“I wish that I could have spared you this pain,” said Lydgate, deeply\ntouched, yet wondering about her marriage. Women just like Dorothea had\nnot entered into his traditions.“It was right of you to tell me. I thank you for telling me the truth.”“I wish you to understand that I shall not say anything to enlighten\nMr. Casaubon himself. I think it desirable for him to know nothing more\nthan that he must not overwork himself, and must observe certain rules.\nAnxiety of any kind would be precisely the most unfavorable condition\nfor him.”Lydgate rose, and Dorothea mechanically rose at the same time,\nunclasping her cloak and throwing it off as if it stifled her. He was\nbowing and quitting her, when an impulse which if she had been alone\nwould have turned into a prayer, made her say with a sob in her voice—“Oh, you are a wise man, are you not? You know all about life and\ndeath. Advise me. Think what I can do. He has been laboring all his\nlife and looking forward. He minds about nothing else.— And I mind\nabout nothing else—”"
