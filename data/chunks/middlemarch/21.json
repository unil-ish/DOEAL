  "content": "Will was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with his\n“principal,” and he went to shut himself in his rooms with a\nhalf-formed resolve to throw up the “Pioneer” and Mr. Brooke together.\nWhy should he stay? If the impassable gulf between himself and Dorothea\nwere ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his going away and\ngetting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here and\nslipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke’s. Then\ncame the young dream of wonders that he might do—in five years, for\nexample: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher\nvalue now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they\nmight give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking\nDorothea to step down to him. Five years:—if he could only be sure that\nshe cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware\nthat he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering\nhimself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at\nfive-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things,\nwhere talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.\nHe could speak and he could write; he could master any subject if he\nchose, and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on\nwhich he would carry all his ardor. Why should he not one day be lifted\nabove the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that\neminence well? Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch, go to town,\nand make himself fit for celebrity by “eating his dinners.”But not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him\nand Dorothea. He could not be satisfied until she knew why, even if he\nwere the man she would choose to marry, he would not marry her. Hence\nhe must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer.But he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him\nin the wish to break up their connection. Deputations without and\nvoices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a\nstronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to\nwithdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he left the advantages\nof his canvassing machinery. He himself called this a strong measure,\nbut observed that his health was less capable of sustaining excitement\nthan he had imagined.“I have felt uneasy about the chest—it won’t do to carry that too far,”\nhe said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair. “I must pull up. Poor\nCasaubon was a warning, you know. I’ve made some heavy advances, but\nI’ve dug a channel. It’s rather coarse work—this electioneering, eh,\nLadislaw? dare say you are tired of it. However, we have dug a channel\nwith the ‘Pioneer’—put things in a track, and so on. A more ordinary\nman than you might carry it on now—more ordinary, you know.”“Do you wish me to give it up?” said Will, the quick color coming in\nhis face, as he rose from the writing-table, and took a turn of three\nsteps with his hands in his pockets. “I am ready to do so whenever you\nwish it.”"

  "content": "“As to wishing, my dear Ladislaw, I have the highest opinion of your\npowers, you know. But about the ‘Pioneer,’ I have been consulting a\nlittle with some of the men on our side, and they are inclined to take\nit into their hands—indemnify me to a certain extent—carry it on, in\nfact. And under the circumstances, you might like to give up—might find\na better field. These people might not take that high view of you which\nI have always taken, as an alter ego, a right hand—though I always\nlooked forward to your doing something else. I think of having a run\ninto France. But I’ll write you any letters, you know—to Althorpe and\npeople of that kind. I’ve met Althorpe.”“I am exceedingly obliged to you,” said Ladislaw, proudly. “Since you\nare going to part with the ‘Pioneer,’ I need not trouble you about the\nsteps I shall take. I may choose to continue here for the present.”After Mr. Brooke had left him Will said to himself, “The rest of the\nfamily have been urging him to get rid of me, and he doesn’t care now\nabout my going. I shall stay as long as I like. I shall go of my own\nmovements and not because they are afraid of me.”CHAPTER LII.“His heart\nThe lowliest duties on itself did lay.”\n—WORDSWORTH.On that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that he was to have the\nLowick living, there was joy in the old fashioned parlor, and even the\nportraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction. His\nmother left her tea and toast untouched, but sat with her usual pretty\nprimness, only showing her emotion by that flush in the cheeks and\nbrightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary\nidentity with her far-off youthful self, and saying decisively—“The greatest comfort, Camden, is that you have deserved it.”“When a man gets a good berth, mother, half the deserving must come\nafter,” said the son, brimful of pleasure, and not trying to conceal\nit. The gladness in his face was of that active kind which seems to\nhave energy enough not only to flash outwardly, but to light up busy\nvision within: one seemed to see thoughts, as well as delight, in his\nglances.“Now, aunt,” he went on, rubbing his hands and looking at Miss Noble,\nwho was making tender little beaver-like noises, “There shall be\nsugar-candy always on the table for you to steal and give to the\nchildren, and you shall have a great many new stockings to make\npresents of, and you shall darn your own more than ever!”Miss Noble nodded at her nephew with a subdued half-frightened laugh,\nconscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into\nher basket on the strength of the new preferment."

But who is in love with me? I am a seedy old\nfellow,” said the Vicar, rising, pushing his chair away and looking\ndown at himself. “What do you say, mother?”“You are a handsome man, Camden: though not so fine a figure of a man\nas your father,” said the old lady.“I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother,” said Miss Winifred. “She\nwould make us so lively at Lowick.”“Very fine! You talk as if young women were tied up to be chosen, like\npoultry at market; as if I had only to ask and everybody would have\nme,” said the Vicar, not caring to specify.“We don’t want everybody,” said Miss Winifred. “But _you_ would like\nMiss Garth, mother, shouldn’t you?”“My son’s choice shall be mine,” said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic\ndiscretion, “and a wife would be most welcome, Camden. You will want\nyour whist at home when we go to Lowick, and Henrietta Noble never was\na whist-player.” (Mrs. Farebrother always called her tiny old sister by\nthat magnificent name.)“I shall do without whist now, mother.”“Why so, Camden? In my time whist was thought an undeniable amusement\nfor a good churchman,” said Mrs. Farebrother, innocent of the meaning\nthat whist had for her son, and speaking rather sharply, as at some\ndangerous countenancing of new doctrine.“I shall be too busy for whist; I shall have two parishes,” said the\nVicar, preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game.He had already said to Dorothea, “I don’t feel bound to give up St.\nBotolph’s. It is protest enough against the pluralism they want to\nreform if I give somebody else most of the money. The stronger thing is\nnot to give up power, but to use it well.”"

  "content": "“I have thought of that,” said Dorothea. “So far as self is concerned,\nI think it would be easier to give up power and money than to keep\nthem. It seems very unfitting that I should have this patronage, yet I\nfelt that I ought not to let it be used by some one else instead of\nme.”“It is I who am bound to act so that you will not regret your power,”\nsaid Mr. Farebrother.His was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active\nwhen the yoke of life ceases to gall them. He made no display of\nhumility on the subject, but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that\nhis conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices\nwere free from.“I used often to wish I had been something else than a clergyman,” he\nsaid to Lydgate, “but perhaps it will be better to try and make as good\na clergyman out of myself as I can. That is the well-beneficed point of\nview, you perceive, from which difficulties are much simplified,” he\nended, smiling.The Vicar did feel then as if his share of duties would be easy. But\nDuty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly—something like a heavy friend\nwhom we have amiably asked to visit us, and who breaks his leg within\nour gates.Hardly a week later, Duty presented itself in his study under the\ndisguise of Fred Vincy, now returned from Omnibus College with his\nbachelor’s degree.“I am ashamed to trouble you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred, whose fair\nopen face was propitiating, “but you are the only friend I can consult.\nI told you everything once before, and you were so good that I can’t\nhelp coming to you again.”“Sit down, Fred, I’m ready to hear and do anything I can,” said the\nVicar, who was busy packing some small objects for removal, and went on\nwith his work.“I wanted to tell you—” Fred hesitated an instant and then went on\nplungingly, “I might go into the Church now; and really, look where I\nmay, I can’t see anything else to do. I don’t like it, but I know it’s\nuncommonly hard on my father to say so, after he has spent a good deal\nof money in educating me for it.” Fred paused again an instant, and\nthen repeated, “and I can’t see anything else to do.”"

  "content": "“I did talk to your father about it, Fred, but I made little way with\nhim. He said it was too late. But you have got over one bridge now:\nwhat are your other difficulties?”“Merely that I don’t like it. I don’t like divinity, and preaching, and\nfeeling obliged to look serious. I like riding across country, and\ndoing as other men do. I don’t mean that I want to be a bad fellow in\nany way; but I’ve no taste for the sort of thing people expect of a\nclergyman. And yet what else am I to do? My father can’t spare me any\ncapital, else I might go into farming. And he has no room for me in his\ntrade. And of course I can’t begin to study for law or physic now, when\nmy father wants me to earn something. It’s all very well to say I’m\nwrong to go into the Church; but those who say so might as well tell me\nto go into the backwoods.”Fred’s voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance, and Mr.\nFarebrother might have been inclined to smile if his mind had not been\ntoo busy in imagining more than Fred told him.“Have you any difficulties about doctrines—about the Articles?” he\nsaid, trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred’s sake.“No; I suppose the Articles are right. I am not prepared with any\narguments to disprove them, and much better, cleverer fellows than I am\ngo in for them entirely. I think it would be rather ridiculous in me to\nurge scruples of that sort, as if I were a judge,” said Fred, quite\nsimply.“I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair\nparish priest without being much of a divine?”“Of course, if I am obliged to be a clergyman, I shall try and do my\nduty, though I mayn’t like it. Do you think any body ought to blame\nme?”“For going into the Church under the circumstances? That depends on\nyour conscience, Fred—how far you have counted the cost, and seen what\nyour position will require of you. I can only tell you about myself,\nthat I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence.”"

There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her ever since we\nwere children.”“Miss Garth, I suppose?” said the Vicar, examining some labels very\nclosely.“Yes. I shouldn’t mind anything if she would have me. And I know I\ncould be a good fellow then.”“And you think she returns the feeling?”“She never will say so; and a good while ago she made me promise not to\nspeak to her about it again. And she has set her mind especially\nagainst my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can’t give her up. I\ndo think she cares about me. I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she said\nthat Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother.”“Yes, she is very kindly helping my sister. Do you wish to go there?”“No, I want to ask a great favor of you. I am ashamed to bother you in\nthis way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you mentioned the\nsubject to her—I mean about my going into the Church.”“That is rather a delicate task, my dear Fred. I shall have to\npresuppose your attachment to her; and to enter on the subject as you\nwish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether she returns it.”“That is what I want her to tell you,” said Fred, bluntly. “I don’t\nknow what to do, unless I can get at her feeling.”“You mean that you would be guided by that as to your going into the\nChurch?”“If Mary said she would never have me I might as well go wrong in one\nway as another.”“That is nonsense, Fred. Men outlive their love, but they don’t outlive\nthe consequences of their recklessness.”“Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary. If I had\nto give her up, it would be like beginning to live on wooden legs.”“Will she not be hurt at my intrusion?”"

Of course I could\nnot have told any one else, or asked any one else to speak to her, but\nyou. There is no one else who could be such a friend to both of us.”\nFred paused a moment, and then said, rather complainingly, “And she\nought to acknowledge that I have worked in order to pass. She ought to\nbelieve that I would exert myself for her sake.”There was a moment’s silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down his work,\nand putting out his hand to Fred said—“Very well, my boy. I will do what you wish.”That very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which\nhe had just set up. “Decidedly I am an old stalk,” he thought, “the\nyoung growths are pushing me aside.”He found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals\non a sheet. The sun was low, and tall trees sent their shadows across\nthe grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol. She\ndid not observe Mr. Farebrother’s approach along the grass, and had\njust stooped down to lecture a small black-and-tan terrier, which would\npersist in walking on the sheet and smelling at the rose-leaves as Mary\nsprinkled them. She took his fore-paws in one hand, and lifted up the\nforefinger of the other, while the dog wrinkled his brows and looked\nembarrassed. “Fly, Fly, I am ashamed of you,” Mary was saying in a\ngrave contralto. “This is not becoming in a sensible dog; anybody would\nthink you were a silly young gentleman.”“You are unmerciful to young gentlemen, Miss Garth,” said the Vicar,\nwithin two yards of her.Mary started up and blushed. “It always answers to reason with Fly,”\nshe said, laughingly.“But not with young gentlemen?”“Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men.”“I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to\ninterest you in a young gentleman.”“Not a silly one, I hope,” said Mary, beginning to pluck the roses\nagain, and feeling her heart beat uncomfortably.“No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather\naffection and sincerity. However, wisdom lies more in those two\nqualities than people are apt to imagine. I hope you know by those\nmarks what young gentleman I mean.”“Yes, I think I do,” said Mary, bravely, her face getting more serious,\nand her hands cold; “it must be Fred Vincy.”"

I hope\nyou will not think that I consented to take a liberty in promising to\ndo so.”“On the contrary, Mr. Farebrother,” said Mary, giving up the roses, and\nfolding her arms, but unable to look up, “whenever you have anything to\nsay to me I feel honored.”“But before I enter on that question, let me just touch a point on\nwhich your father took me into confidence; by the way, it was that very\nevening on which I once before fulfilled a mission from Fred, just\nafter he had gone to college. Mr. Garth told me what happened on the\nnight of Featherstone’s death—how you refused to burn the will; and he\nsaid that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had\nbeen the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting his ten thousand\npounds. I have kept that in mind, and I have heard something that may\nrelieve you on that score—may show you that no sin-offering is demanded\nfrom you there.”Mr. Farebrother paused a moment and looked at Mary. He meant to give\nFred his full advantage, but it would be well, he thought, to clear her\nmind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when they do\na man the wrong of marrying him as an act of atonement. Mary’s cheeks\nhad begun to burn a little, and she was mute.“I mean, that your action made no real difference to Fred’s lot. I find\nthat the first will would not have been legally good after the burning\nof the last; it would not have stood if it had been disputed, and you\nmay be sure it would have been disputed. So, on that score, you may\nfeel your mind free.”“Thank you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Mary, earnestly. “I am grateful to\nyou for remembering my feelings.”"

That\nquestion is so difficult that he is inclined to follow his father’s\nwishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that he\nwas quite set against that formerly. I have questioned him on the\nsubject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to his being a\nclergyman, as things go. He says that he could turn his mind to doing\nhis best in that vocation, on one condition. If that condition were\nfulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred on. After a time—not, of\ncourse, at first—he might be with me as my curate, and he would have so\nmuch to do that his stipend would be nearly what I used to get as\nvicar. But I repeat that there is a condition without which all this\ngood cannot come to pass. He has opened his heart to me, Miss Garth,\nand asked me to plead for him. The condition lies entirely in your\nfeeling.”Mary looked so much moved, that he said after a moment, “Let us walk a\nlittle;” and when they were walking he added, “To speak quite plainly,\nFred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you\nwould consent to be his wife; but with that prospect, he will try his\nbest at anything you approve.”“I cannot possibly say that I will ever be his wife, Mr. Farebrother:\nbut I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman. What\nyou say is most generous and kind; I don’t mean for a moment to correct\nyour judgment. It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of\nlooking at things,” said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness\nin her answer which only made its modesty more charming.“He wishes me to report exactly what you think,” said Mr. Farebrother.“I could not love a man who is ridiculous,” said Mary, not choosing to\ngo deeper. “Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make him\nrespectable, if he likes, in some good worldly business, but I can\nnever imagine him preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings,\nand praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a\ncaricature. His being a clergyman would be only for gentility’s sake,\nand I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile\ngentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and\nneat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men to\nrepresent Christianity—as if it were an institution for getting up\nidiots genteelly—as if—” Mary checked herself. She had been carried\nalong as if she had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother.“Young women are severe: they don’t feel the stress of action as men\ndo, though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there. But you\ndon’t put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?”“No, indeed, he has plenty of sense, but I think he would not show it\nas a clergyman. He would be a piece of professional affectation.”“Then the answer is quite decided. As a clergyman he could have no\nhope?”"

May he count on\nwinning you?”“I think Fred ought not to need telling again what I have already said\nto him,” Mary answered, with a slight resentment in her manner. “I mean\nthat he ought not to put such questions until he has done something\nworthy, instead of saying that he could do it.”Mr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more, and then, as they\nturned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy\nwalk, said, “I understand that you resist any attempt to fetter you,\nbut either your feeling for Fred Vincy excludes your entertaining\nanother attachment, or it does not: either he may count on your\nremaining single until he shall have earned your hand, or he may in any\ncase be disappointed. Pardon me, Mary—you know I used to catechise you\nunder that name—but when the state of a woman’s affections touches the\nhappiness of another life—of more lives than one—I think it would be\nthe nobler course for her to be perfectly direct and open.”Mary in her turn was silent, wondering not at Mr. Farebrother’s manner\nbut at his tone, which had a grave restrained emotion in it. When the\nstrange idea flashed across her that his words had reference to\nhimself, she was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it. She had\nnever thought that any man could love her except Fred, who had espoused\nher with the umbrella ring, when she wore socks and little strapped\nshoes; still less that she could be of any importance to Mr.\nFarebrother, the cleverest man in her narrow circle. She had only time\nto feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory; but one thing was\nclear and determined—her answer."

It has taken such deep root in me—my gratitude to him for always\nloving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time\nwhen we were very little. I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to\nmake that weaker. I should like better than anything to see him worthy\nof every one’s respect.

With this prospect before him, we shall get Fred into the\nright niche somehow, and I hope I shall live to join your hands. God\nbless you!”“Oh, please stay, and let me give you some tea,” said Mary.

I must get back.”In three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again, having gone\nmagnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of\nwhist, or even than the writing of penitential meditations.CHAPTER LIII.It is but a shallow haste which concludeth insincerity from what\noutsiders call inconsistency—putting a dead mechanism of “ifs” and\n“therefores” for the living myriad of hidden suckers whereby the belief\nand the conduct are wrought into mutual sustainment."

  "content": "Mr. Bulstrode, when he was hoping to acquire a new interest in Lowick,\nhad naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman should be one\nwhom he thoroughly approved; and he believed it to be a chastisement\nand admonition directed to his own shortcomings and those of the nation\nat large, that just about the time when he came in possession of the\ndeeds which made him the proprietor of Stone Court, Mr. Farebrother\n“read himself” into the quaint little church and preached his first\nsermon to the congregation of farmers, laborers, and village artisans.\nIt was not that Mr. Bulstrode intended to frequent Lowick Church or to\nreside at Stone Court for a good while to come: he had bought the\nexcellent farm and fine homestead simply as a retreat which he might\ngradually enlarge as to the land and beautify as to the dwelling, until\nit should be conducive to the divine glory that he should enter on it\nas a residence, partially withdrawing from his present exertions in the\nadministration of business, and throwing more conspicuously on the side\nof Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship, which\nProvidence might increase by unforeseen occasions of purchase. A strong\nleading in this direction seemed to have been given in the surprising\nfacility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected that Mr.\nRigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of Eden. That\nwas what poor old Peter himself had expected; having often, in\nimagination, looked up through the sods above him, and, unobstructed by\nperspective, seen his frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old place to\nthe perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors.But how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors! We\njudge from our own desires, and our neighbors themselves are not always\nopen enough even to throw out a hint of theirs. The cool and judicious\nJoshua Rigg had not allowed his parent to perceive that Stone Court was\nanything less than the chief good in his estimation, and he had\ncertainly wished to call it his own. But as Warren Hastings looked at\ngold and thought of buying Daylesford, so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone\nCourt and thought of buying gold. He had a very distinct and intense\nvision of his chief good, the vigorous greed which he had inherited\nhaving taken a special form by dint of circumstance: and his chief good\nwas to be a moneychanger. From his earliest employment as an errand-boy\nin a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers as\nother boys look through the windows of the pastry-cooks; the\nfascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep special passion;\nhe meant, when he had property, to do many things, one of them being to\nmarry a genteel young person; but these were all accidents and joys\nthat imagination could dispense with. The one joy after which his soul\nthirsted was to have a money-changer’s shop on a much-frequented quay,\nto have locks all round him of which he held the keys, and to look\nsublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations, while\nhelpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the other side of an\niron lattice. The strength of that passion had been a power enabling\nhim to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it. And when\nothers were thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for life,\nJoshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off when he\nshould settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in safes and\nlocks."

We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg’s sale of his land\nfrom Mr. Bulstrode’s point of view, and he interpreted it as a cheering\ndispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for\nsome time entertained without external encouragement; he interpreted it\nthus, but not too confidently, offering up his thanksgiving in guarded\nphraseology. His doubts did not arise from the possible relations of\nthe event to Joshua Rigg’s destiny, which belonged to the unmapped\nregions not taken under the providential government, except perhaps in\nan imperfect colonial way; but they arose from reflecting that this\ndispensation too might be a chastisement for himself, as Mr.\nFarebrother’s induction to the living clearly was.This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of\ndeceiving him: it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely his\nmode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen\nto disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our theories\ndoes not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is\nsatisfied, the more robust is our belief.However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,\nhardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become\nthe proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say “if he were\nworthy to know,” had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of\nconversation to his disappointed relatives. The tables were now turned\non that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of\nhis cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of\ndelight to Solomon. Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof\nthat it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the\ngenuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said,\n“Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so pleased with the\nalmshouses after all.”Affectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage\nwhich her husband’s health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone\nCourt. Few days passed without his riding thither and looking over some\npart of the farm with the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious in\nthat quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks lately set up were sending\nforth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden. One\nevening, while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in\ngolden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was pausing\non horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had\nmet him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable\ndrainage, and was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard."

  "content": "Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more\nthan usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation. He\nwas doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in\nhimself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when\nthe sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and\nrevive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be\nheld with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a\nmeasure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are\npeculiar instruments of the divine intention. The memory has as many\nmoods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this\nmoment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of\nfar-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out\npreaching beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service\nof exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was\nhis own facility in expounding them. His brief reverie was interrupted\nby the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback, and was just\nshaking his bridle before starting, when he exclaimed—“Bless my heart! what’s this fellow in black coming along the lane?\nHe’s like one of those men one sees about after the races.”Mr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but made no\nreply. The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose\nappearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of\nblack and a crape hat-band. He was within three yards of the horseman\nnow, and they could see the flash of recognition in his face as he\nwhirled his stick upward, looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode, and\nat last exclaiming:—“By Jove, Nick, it’s you! I couldn’t be mistaken, though the\nfive-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both! How are you,\neh? you didn’t expect to see _me_ here. Come, shake us by the hand.” To\nsay that Mr. Raffles’ manner was rather excited would be only one mode\nof saying that it was evening. Caleb Garth could see that there was a\nmoment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode, but it ended in his\nputting out his hand coldly to Raffles and saying—“I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.”“Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,” said Raffles, adjusting\nhimself in a swaggering attitude. “I came to see him here before. I’m\nnot so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a\nletter—what you may call a providential thing. It’s uncommonly\nfortunate I met you, though; for I don’t care about seeing my stepson:\nhe’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone now. To tell the\ntruth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address,\nfor—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket."

  "content": "Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger\non the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose\nacquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker’s\nlife so unlike anything that was known of him in Middlemarch that they\nmust have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity. But Caleb was\npeculiar: certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were\nalmost absent from his mind; and one of these was curiosity about\npersonal affairs. Especially if there was anything discreditable to be\nfound out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and\nif he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were\ndiscovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit. He now spurred\nhis horse, and saying, “I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must\nbe getting home,” set off at a trot.“You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles continued.\n“That was not like the first-rate man of business you used to be. ‘The\nShrubs,’—they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut the\nLondon concern altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a rural\nmansion to invite me to. Lord, how many years it is ago! The old lady\nmust have been dead a pretty long while—gone to glory without the pain\nof knowing how poor her daughter was, eh? But, by Jove! you’re very\npale and pasty, Nick. Come, if you’re going home, I’ll walk by your\nside.”Mr. Bulstrode’s usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue.\nFive minutes before, the expanse of his life had been submerged in its\nevening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin\nseemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation\nan exercise of the closet, the bearing of his deeds a matter of private\nvision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the\ndivine purposes. And now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red\nfigure had risen before him in unmanageable solidity—an incorporate\npast which had not entered into his imagination of chastisements. But\nMr. Bulstrode’s thought was busy, and he was not a man to act or speak\nrashly.“I was going home,” he said, “but I can defer my ride a little. And you\ncan, if you please, rest here.”“Thank you,” said Raffles, making a grimace. “I don’t care now about\nseeing my stepson. I’d rather go home with you.”“Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he, is here no longer. I am\nmaster here now.”"

  "content": "Raffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before\nhe said, “Well then, I’ve no objection. I’ve had enough walking from\nthe coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider either. What I\nlike is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob. I was always a little heavy\nin the saddle. What a pleasant surprise it must be to you to see me,\nold fellow!” he continued, as they turned towards the house. “You don’t\nsay so; but you never took your luck heartily—you were always thinking\nof improving the occasion—you’d such a gift for improving your luck.”Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and swung his leg in a\nswaggering manner which was rather too much for his companion’s\njudicious patience.“If I remember rightly,” Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, “our\nacquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are\nnow assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you desire of me will be the\nmore readily rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did\nnot lie in our former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more\nthan twenty years of separation.”“You don’t like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick in my\nheart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my feelings\nhave ripened for you like fine old cognac. I hope you’ve got some in\nthe house now. Josh filled my flask well the last time.”Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac\nwas not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint\nof annoyance always served him as a fresh cue. But it was at least\nclear that further objection was useless, and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving\norders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest, had a\nresolute air of quietude.There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the\nservice of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode\nentertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former master.When there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the\nwainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said—"

  "content": "“Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly\nenjoy each other’s society. The wisest plan for both of us will\ntherefore be to part as soon as possible. Since you say that you wished\nto meet me, you probably considered that you had some business to\ntransact with me. But under the circumstances I will invite you to\nremain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early\nto-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can receive any\ncommunication you have to make to me.”“With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable place—a\nlittle dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night,\nwith this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the\nmorning. You’re a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed\nme a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between you and me\nthere was never anything but kindness.”Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and\nsneering in Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had\ndetermined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words\nupon him. But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the\ndifficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be\npermanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he should\nwish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could not be\nregarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might\nhave sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode’s subversion as an instrument\nof good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a\nchastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him very\ndifferent from the hours in which his struggle had been securely\nprivate, and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were\npardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds even when\ncommitted—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his\ndesire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the\ndivine scheme? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling\nand a rock of offence? For who would understand the work within him?\nWho would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him,\nconfound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of\nobloquy?"

  "content": "In his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode’s mind\nclad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman\nends. But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth’s\norbit and the solar system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is\nthe stable earth and the changing day. And now within all the automatic\nsuccession of theoretic phrases—distinct and inmost as the shiver and\nthe ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract pain, was\nthe forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and of his\nown wife. For the pain, as well as the public estimate of disgrace,\ndepends on the amount of previous profession. To men who only aim at\nescaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner’s dock is disgrace. But\nMr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.It was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he again\nreached Stone Court. The fine old place never looked more like a\ndelightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in\nflower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew,\nwere running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around\nhad a heart of peace within them. But everything was spoiled for the\nowner as he walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of\nMr. Raffles, with whom he was condemned to breakfast.It was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted\nparlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to\ntake at that early hour. The difference between his morning and evening\nself was not so great as his companion had imagined that it might be;\nthe delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger because his\nspirits were rather less highly pitched. Certainly his manners seemed\nmore disagreeable by the morning light.“As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,” said the banker, who\ncould hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without\neating it, “I shall be obliged if you will mention at once the ground\non which you wished to meet with me. I presume that you have a home\nelsewhere and will be glad to return to it.”“Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend,\nNick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we\nknew you meant to marry the old widow. Some said you had a handsome\nfamily likeness to old Nick, but that was your mother’s fault, calling\nyou Nicholas. Aren’t you glad to see me again? I expected an invite to\nstay with you at some pretty place. My own establishment is broken up\nnow my wife’s dead. I’ve no particular attachment to any spot; I would\nas soon settle hereabout as anywhere.”"

  "content": "“May I ask why you returned from America? I considered that the strong\nwish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was\ntantamount to an engagement that you would remain there for life.”“Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a wish\nto stay. But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn’t suit me to\nstay any longer. And I’m not going again, Nick.” Here Mr. Raffles\nwinked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode.“Do you wish to be settled in any business? What is your calling now?”“Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can. I don’t\ncare about working any more. If I did anything it would be a little\ntravelling in the tobacco line—or something of that sort, which takes a\nman into agreeable company. But not without an independence to fall\nback upon. That’s what I want: I’m not so strong as I was, Nick, though\nI’ve got more color than you. I want an independence.”“That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a\ndistance,” said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much eagerness\nin his undertone.“That must be as it suits my convenience,” said Raffles coolly. “I see\nno reason why I shouldn’t make a few acquaintances hereabout. I’m not\nashamed of myself as company for anybody. I dropped my portmanteau at\nthe turnpike when I got down—change of linen—genuine—honor bright—more\nthan fronts and wristbands; and with this suit of mourning, straps and\neverything, I should do you credit among the nobs here.” Mr. Raffles\nhad pushed away his chair and looked down at himself, particularly at\nhis straps. His chief intention was to annoy Bulstrode, but he really\nthought that his appearance now would produce a good effect, and that\nhe was not only handsome and witty, but clad in a mourning style which\nimplied solid connections.“If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,” said Bulstrode,\nafter a moment’s pause, “you will expect to meet my wishes.”"

  "content": "“Ah, to be sure,” said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality. “Didn’t I\nalways do it? Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me, and I got but\nlittle. I’ve often thought since, I might have done better by telling\nthe old woman that I’d found her daughter and her grandchild: it would\nhave suited my feelings better; I’ve got a soft place in my heart. But\nyou’ve buried the old lady by this time, I suppose—it’s all one to her\nnow. And you’ve got your fortune out of that profitable business which\nhad such a blessing on it. You’ve taken to being a nob, buying land,\nbeing a country bashaw. Still in the Dissenting line, eh? Still godly?\nOr taken to the Church as more genteel?”This time Mr. Raffles’ slow wink and slight protrusion of his tongue\nwas worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was\nnot a nightmare, but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering\nnausea, and did not speak, but was considering diligently whether he\nshould not leave Raffles to do as he would, and simply defy him as a\nslanderer. The man would soon show himself disreputable enough to make\npeople disbelieve him. “But not when he tells any ugly-looking truth\nabout _you_,” said discerning consciousness. And again: it seemed no\nwrong to keep Raffles at a distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the\ndirect falsehood of denying true statements. It was one thing to look\nback on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax\ncustoms, and another to enter deliberately on the necessity of\nfalsehood.But since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of using time\nto the utmost.“I’ve not had such fine luck as you, by Jove! Things went confoundedly\nwith me in New York; those Yankees are cool hands, and a man of\ngentlemanly feelings has no chance with them. I married when I came\nback—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of me—but the trade\nwas restricted, as we say. She had been settled there a good many years\nby a friend; but there was a son too much in the case. Josh and I never\nhit it off. However, I made the most of the position, and I’ve always\ntaken my glass in good company. It’s been all on the square with me;\nI’m as open as the day. You won’t take it ill of me that I didn’t look\nyou up before. I’ve got a complaint that makes me a little dilatory. I\nthought you were trading and praying away in London still, and didn’t\nfind you there. But you see I was sent to you, Nick—perhaps for a\nblessing to both of us.”"

  "content": "Mr. Raffles ended with a jocose snuffle: no man felt his intellect more\nsuperior to religious cant. And if the cunning which calculates on the\nmeanest feelings in men could be called intellect, he had his share,\nfor under the blurting rallying tone with which he spoke to Bulstrode,\nthere was an evident selection of statements, as if they had been so\nmany moves at chess. Meanwhile Bulstrode had determined on his move,\nand he said, with gathered resolution—“You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible for a\nman to overreach himself in the effort to secure undue advantage.\nAlthough I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing to supply you\nwith a regular annuity—in quarterly payments—so long as you fulfil a\npromise to remain at a distance from this neighborhood. It is in your\npower to choose. If you insist on remaining here, even for a short\ntime, you will get nothing from me. I shall decline to know you.”“Ha, ha!” said Raffles, with an affected explosion, “that reminds me of\na droll dog of a thief who declined to know the constable.”“Your allusions are lost on me sir,” said Bulstrode, with white heat;\n“the law has no hold on me either through your agency or any other.”“You can’t understand a joke, my good fellow. I only meant that I\nshould never decline to know you. But let us be serious. Your quarterly\npayment won’t quite suit me. I like my freedom.”Here Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room,\nswinging his leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation. At last\nhe stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, “I’ll tell you what! Give us a\ncouple of hundreds—come, that’s modest—and I’ll go away—honor\nbright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall not give up my\nliberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go where I like. Perhaps\nit may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a friend; perhaps not.\nHave you the money with you?”“No, I have one hundred,” said Bulstrode, feeling the immediate\nriddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future\nuncertainties. “I will forward you the other if you will mention an\naddress.”“No, I’ll wait here till you bring it,” said Raffles. “I’ll take a\nstroll and have a snack, and you’ll be back by that time.”"
