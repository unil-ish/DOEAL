  "content": "Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even from\nMr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be\nconscious of expressing one’s self better than others and never to have\nit noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the right\nthing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather\nfortifying. Will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond\nthe limits of Middlemarch perception; nevertheless, he was beginning\nthoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to\nhimself rather languidly, “Why not?”—and he studied the political\nsituation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic\nmetres or mediaevalism. It is undeniable that but for the desire to be\nwhere Dorothea was, and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do,\nWill would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the\nEnglish people or criticising English statesmanship: he would probably\nhave been rambling in Italy sketching plans for several dramas, trying\nprose and finding it too jejune, trying verse and finding it too\nartificial, beginning to copy “bits” from old pictures, leaving off\nbecause they were “no good,” and observing that, after all,\nself-culture was the principal point; while in politics he would have\nbeen sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general. Our\nsense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place\nof dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not\na matter of indifference.Ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work, though it was not that\nindeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone\nworthy of continuous effort. His nature warmed easily in the presence\nof subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action, and the\neasily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit. In\nspite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick, he was rather\nhappy; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for\npractical purposes, and making the “Pioneer” celebrated as far as\nBrassing (never mind the smallness of the area; the writing was not\nworse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth).Mr. Brooke was occasionally irritating; but Will’s impatience was\nrelieved by the division of his time between visits to the Grange and\nretreats to his Middlemarch lodgings, which gave variety to his life.“Shift the pegs a little,” he said to himself, “and Mr. Brooke might be\nin the Cabinet, while I was Under-Secretary. That is the common order\nof things: the little waves make the large ones and are of the same\npattern. I am better here than in the sort of life Mr. Casaubon would\nhave trained me for, where the doing would be all laid down by a\nprecedent too rigid for me to react upon. I don’t care for prestige or\nhigh pay.”"

  "content": "As Lydgate had said of him, he was a sort of gypsy, rather enjoying the\nsense of belonging to no class; he had a feeling of romance in his\nposition, and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise\nwherever he went. That sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had\nfelt some new distance between himself and Dorothea in their accidental\nmeeting at Lydgate’s, and his irritation had gone out towards Mr.\nCasaubon, who had declared beforehand that Will would lose caste. “I\nnever had any caste,” he would have said, if that prophecy had been\nuttered to him, and the quick blood would have come and gone like\nbreath in his transparent skin. But it is one thing to like defiance,\nand another thing to like its consequences.Meanwhile, the town opinion about the new editor of the “Pioneer” was\ntending to confirm Mr. Casaubon’s view. Will’s relationship in that\ndistinguished quarter did not, like Lydgate’s high connections, serve\nas an advantageous introduction: if it was rumored that young Ladislaw\nwas Mr. Casaubon’s nephew or cousin, it was also rumored that “Mr.\nCasaubon would have nothing to do with him.”“Brooke has taken him up,” said Mr. Hawley, “because that is what no\nman in his senses could have expected. Casaubon has devilish good\nreasons, you may be sure, for turning the cold shoulder on a young\nfellow whose bringing-up he paid for. Just like Brooke—one of those\nfellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse.”And some oddities of Will’s, more or less poetical, appeared to support\nMr. Keck, the editor of the “Trumpet,” in asserting that Ladislaw, if\nthe truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary but crack-brained,\nwhich accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his\nspeech when he got on to a platform—as he did whenever he had an\nopportunity, speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid\nEnglishmen generally. It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a\nfellow, with light curls round his head, get up and speechify by the\nhour against institutions “which had existed when he was in his\ncradle.” And in a leading article of the “Trumpet,” Keck characterized\nLadislaw’s speech at a Reform meeting as “the violence of an\nenergumen—a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks\nthe daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge\nwhich was of the cheapest and most recent description.”“That was a rattling article yesterday, Keck,” said Dr. Sprague, with\nsarcastic intentions. “But what is an energumen?”“Oh, a term that came up in the French Revolution,” said Keck."

  "content": "This dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other\nhabits which became matter of remark. He had a fondness, half artistic,\nhalf affectionate, for little children—the smaller they were on\ntolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the better Will\nliked to surprise and please them. We know that in Rome he was given to\nramble about among the poor people, and the taste did not quit him in\nMiddlemarch.He had somehow picked up a troop of droll children, little hatless boys\nwith their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out,\nlittle girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him,\nand guardian brothers at the mature age of seven. This troop he had led\nout on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at nutting-time, and since the\ncold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather\nsticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside, where he drew out a\nsmall feast of gingerbread for them, and improvised a Punch-and-Judy\ndrama with some private home-made puppets. Here was one oddity. Another\nwas, that in houses where he got friendly, he was given to stretch\nhimself at full length on the rug while he talked, and was apt to be\ndiscovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an\nirregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed\nblood and general laxity.But Will’s articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families\nwhich the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side\nof Reform. He was invited to Mr. Bulstrode’s; but here he could not lie\ndown on the rug, and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his mode of talking about\nCatholic countries, as if there were any truce with Antichrist,\nillustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men.At Mr. Farebrother’s, however, whom the irony of events had brought on\nthe same side with Bulstrode in the national movement, Will became a\nfavorite with the ladies; especially with little Miss Noble, whom it\nwas one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with\nher little basket, giving her his arm in the eyes of the town, and\ninsisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her\nsmall filchings from her own share of sweet things."

  "content": "But the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was\nLydgate’s. The two men were not at all alike, but they agreed none the\nworse. Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable, taking little notice of\nmegrims in healthy people; and Ladislaw did not usually throw away his\nsusceptibilities on those who took no notice of them. With Rosamond, on\nthe other hand, he pouted and was wayward—nay, often uncomplimentary,\nmuch to her inward surprise; nevertheless he was gradually becoming\nnecessary to her entertainment by his companionship in her music, his\nvaried talk, and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which, with\nall her husband’s tenderness and indulgence, often made his manners\nunsatisfactory to her, and confirmed her dislike of the medical\nprofession.Lydgate, inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the\npeople in the efficacy of “the bill,” while nobody cared about the low\nstate of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions.\nOne evening in March, Rosamond in her cherry-colored dress with\nswansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea-table; Lydgate,\nlately come in tired from his outdoor work, was seated sideways on an\neasy-chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow, his brow looking a\nlittle troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the “Pioneer,”\nwhile Rosamond, having noticed that he was perturbed, avoided looking\nat him, and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody\ndisposition. Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the\ncurtain-pole abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of “When\nfirst I saw thy face;” while the house spaniel, also stretched out with\nsmall choice of room, looked from between his paws at the usurper of\nthe rug with silent but strong objection.Rosamond bringing Lydgate his cup of tea, he threw down the paper, and\nsaid to Will, who had started up and gone to the table—“It’s no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord, Ladislaw:\nthey only pick the more holes in his coat in the ‘Trumpet.’”“No matter; those who read the ‘Pioneer’ don’t read the ‘Trumpet,’”\nsaid Will, swallowing his tea and walking about. “Do you suppose the\npublic reads with a view to its own conversion? We should have a\nwitches’ brewing with a vengeance then—‘Mingle, mingle, mingle, mingle,\nYou that mingle may’—and nobody would know which side he was going to\ntake.”“Farebrother says, he doesn’t believe Brooke would get elected if the\nopportunity came: the very men who profess to be for him would bring\nanother member out of the bag at the right moment.”“There’s no harm in trying. It’s good to have resident members.”“Why?” said Lydgate, who was much given to use that inconvenient word\nin a curt tone."

Brooke is not a bad fellow, but he has done some good\nthings on his estate that he never would have done but for this\nParliamentary bite.”“He’s not fitted to be a public man,” said Lydgate, with contemptuous\ndecision. “He would disappoint everybody who counted on him: I can see\nthat at the Hospital. Only, there Bulstrode holds the reins and drives\nhim.”“That depends on how you fix your standard of public men,” said Will.\n“He’s good enough for the occasion: when the people have made up their\nmind as they are making it up now, they don’t want a man—they only want\na vote.”“That is the way with you political writers, Ladislaw—crying up a\nmeasure as if it were a universal cure, and crying up men who are a\npart of the very disease that wants curing.”“Why not? Men may help to cure themselves off the face of the land\nwithout knowing it,” said Will, who could find reasons impromptu, when\nhe had not thought of a question beforehand.“That is no excuse for encouraging the superstitious exaggeration of\nhopes about this particular measure, helping the cry to swallow it\nwhole and to send up voting popinjays who are good for nothing but to\ncarry it. You go against rottenness, and there is nothing more\nthoroughly rotten than making people believe that society can be cured\nby a political hocus-pocus.”“That’s very fine, my dear fellow. But your cure must begin somewhere,\nand put it that a thousand things which debase a population can never\nbe reformed without this particular reform to begin with. Look what\nStanley said the other day—that the House had been tinkering long\nenough at small questions of bribery, inquiring whether this or that\nvoter has had a guinea when everybody knows that the seats have been\nsold wholesale. Wait for wisdom and conscience in public\nagents—fiddlestick! The only conscience we can trust to is the massive\nsense of wrong in a class, and the best wisdom that will work is the\nwisdom of balancing claims. That’s my text—which side is injured? I\nsupport the man who supports their claims; not the virtuous upholder of\nthe wrong.”"

Should you go on that\nplan? If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform and\nanother who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better\nmotives or even the better brains?”“Oh, of course,” said Lydgate, seeing himself checkmated by a move\nwhich he had often used himself, “if one did not work with such men as\nare at hand, things must come to a dead-lock. Suppose the worst opinion\nin the town about Bulstrode were a true one, that would not make it\nless true that he has the sense and the resolution to do what I think\nought to be done in the matters I know and care most about; but that is\nthe only ground on which I go with him,” Lydgate added rather proudly,\nbearing in mind Mr. Farebrother’s remarks. “He is nothing to me\notherwise; I would not cry him up on any personal ground—I would keep\nclear of that.”“Do you mean that I cry up Brooke on any personal ground?” said Will\nLadislaw, nettled, and turning sharp round. For the first time he felt\noffended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he would have\ndeclined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr.\nBrooke.“Not at all,” said Lydgate, “I was simply explaining my own action. I\nmeant that a man may work for a special end with others whose motives\nand general course are equivocal, if he is quite sure of his personal\nindependence, and that he is not working for his private\ninterest—either place or money.”"

You have no more reason to imagine that I have personal\nexpectations from Brooke, than I have to imagine that you have personal\nexpectations from Bulstrode. Motives are points of honor, I\nsuppose—nobody can prove them. But as to money and place in the world,”\nWill ended, tossing back his head, “I think it is pretty clear that I\nam not determined by considerations of that sort.”“You quite mistake me, Ladislaw,” said Lydgate, surprised. He had been\npreoccupied with his own vindication, and had been blind to what\nLadislaw might infer on his own account. “I beg your pardon for\nunintentionally annoying you. In fact, I should rather attribute to you\na romantic disregard of your own worldly interests. On the political\nquestion, I referred simply to intellectual bias.”“How very unpleasant you both are this evening!” said Rosamond. “I\ncannot conceive why money should have been referred to. Politics and\nMedicine are sufficiently disagreeable to quarrel upon. You can both of\nyou go on quarrelling with all the world and with each other on those\ntwo topics.”Rosamond looked mildly neutral as she said this, rising to ring the\nbell, and then crossing to her work-table.“Poor Rosy!” said Lydgate, putting out his hand to her as she was\npassing him. “Disputation is not amusing to cherubs. Have some music.\nAsk Ladislaw to sing with you.”When Will was gone Rosamond said to her husband, “What put you out of\ntemper this evening, Tertius?”“Me? It was Ladislaw who was out of temper. He is like a bit of\ntinder.”“But I mean, before that. Something had vexed you before you came in,\nyou looked cross. And that made you begin to dispute with Mr. Ladislaw.\nYou hurt me very much when you look so, Tertius.”“Do I? Then I am a brute,” said Lydgate, caressing her penitently.“What vexed you?”“Oh, outdoor things—business.” It was really a letter insisting on the\npayment of a bill for furniture. But Rosamond was expecting to have a\nbaby, and Lydgate wished to save her from any perturbation.CHAPTER XLVII.Was never true love loved in vain,\nFor truest love is highest gain.\nNo art can make it: it must spring\nWhere elements are fostering.\nSo in heaven’s spot and hour\nSprings the little native flower,\nDownward root and upward eye,\nShapen by the earth and sky."

Its effect when he went to his own\nrooms was to make him sit up half the night, thinking over again, under\na new irritation, all that he had before thought of his having settled\nin Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr. Brooke. Hesitations\nbefore he had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to\nevery hint that he would have been wiser not to take it; and hence came\nhis heat towards Lydgate—a heat which still kept him restless. Was he\nnot making a fool of himself?—and at a time when he was more than ever\nconscious of being something better than a fool? And for what end?"

  "content": "Well, for no definite end. True, he had dreamy visions of\npossibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and\nthoughts does not think in consequence of his passions—does not find\nimages rising in his mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting\nit with dread. But this, which happens to us all, happens to some with\na wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose wit “keeps the\nroadway:” he had his bypaths where there were little joys of his own\nchoosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have\nthought rather idiotic. The way in which he made a sort of happiness\nfor himself out of his feeling for Dorothea was an example of this. It\nmay seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision\nof which Mr. Casaubon suspected him—namely, that Dorothea might become\na widow, and that the interest he had established in her mind might\nturn into acceptance of him as a husband—had no tempting, arresting\npower over him; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and\nfollow it out, as we all do with that imagined “otherwise” which is our\npractical heaven. It was not only that he was unwilling to entertain\nthoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was already uneasy in\nthe sense that he had to justify himself from the charge of\ningratitude—the latent consciousness of many other barriers between\nhimself and Dorothea besides the existence of her husband, had helped\nto turn away his imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr.\nCasaubon. And there were yet other reasons. Will, we know, could not\nbear the thought of any flaw appearing in his crystal: he was at once\nexasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea\nlooked at him and spoke to him, and there was something so exquisite in\nthinking of her just as she was, that he could not long for a change\nwhich must somehow change her. Do we not shun the street version of a\nfine melody?—or shrink from the news that the rarity—some bit of\nchiselling or engraving perhaps—which we have dwelt on even with\nexultation in the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is\nreally not an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day\npossession? Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our emotion;\nand to Will, a creature who cared little for what are called the solid\nthings of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to have within\nhim such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea, was like the inheritance\nof a fortune. What others might have called the futility of his\npassion, made an additional delight for his imagination: he was\nconscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in his own\nexperience that higher love-poetry which had charmed his fancy.\nDorothea, he said to himself, was forever enthroned in his soul: no\nother woman could sit higher than her footstool; and if he could have\nwritten out in immortal syllables the effect she wrought within him, he\nmight have boasted after the example of old Drayton, that,—"

What was his devotion worth to her? It was impossible to\ntell. He would not go out of her reach. He saw no creature among her\nfriends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same simple\nconfidence as to him. She had once said that she would like him to\nstay; and stay he would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss\naround her.This had always been the conclusion of Will’s hesitations. But he was\nnot without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own\nresolve. He had often got irritated, as he was on this particular\nnight, by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr.\nBrooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he would like them to be,\nand this was always associated with the other ground of irritation—that\nnotwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea’s sake, he could\nhardly ever see her. Whereupon, not being able to contradict these\nunpleasant facts, he contradicted his own strongest bias and said, “I\nam a fool.”Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea,\nhe ended, as he had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of\nwhat her presence would be to him; and suddenly reflecting that the\nmorrow would be Sunday, he determined to go to Lowick Church and see\nher. He slept upon that idea, but when he was dressing in the rational\nmorning light, Objection said—“That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon’s prohibition to visit\nLowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.”“Nonsense!” argued Inclination, “it would be too monstrous for him to\nhinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring\nmorning. And Dorothea will be glad.”“It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to annoy\nhim or to see Dorothea.”"

Everything seemed to know that it was\nSunday, and to approve of his going to Lowick Church. Will easily felt\nhappy when nothing crossed his humor, and by this time the thought of\nvexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him, making his face\nbreak into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine\non the water—though the occasion was not exemplary. But most of us are\napt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is\nodious, and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his\npersonality excites in ourselves. Will went along with a small book\nunder his arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but\nchanting a little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and\ncoming out. He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his\nown, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. The\nwords were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday\nexperience:—“O me, O me, what frugal cheer\n    My love doth feed upon!\nA touch, a ray, that is not here,\n    A shadow that is gone:“A dream of breath that might be near,\n    An inly-echoed tone,\nThe thought that one may think me dear,\n    The place where one was known,“The tremor of a banished fear,\n     An ill that was not done—\nO me, O me, what frugal cheer\n    My love doth feed upon!”Sometimes, when he took off his hat, shaking his head backward, and\nshowing his delicate throat as he sang, he looked like an incarnation\nof the spring whose spirit filled the air—a bright creature, abundant\nin uncertain promises."

But he was still\nleft alone in it when the congregation had assembled. The curate’s pew\nwas opposite the rector’s at the entrance of the small chancel, and\nWill had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked\nround at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year\nto year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with\nmore change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and\nthere with age, but yet has young shoots. Mr. Rigg’s frog-face was\nsomething alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to\nthe order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of\nthe Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel’s cheek had\nthe same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent\ncottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters\ngenerally—the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the\nblack gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all\nbetters, and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was at\npeace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the\nSunday sermon. The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church\nin former days, and no one took much note of him except the choir, who\nexpected him to make a figure in the singing.Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking up the\nshort aisle in her white beaver bonnet and gray cloak—the same she had\nworn in the Vatican. Her face being, from her entrance, towards the\nchancel, even her shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will, but there was\nno outward show of her feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow\nas she passed him. To his own surprise Will felt suddenly\nuncomfortable, and dared not look at her after they had bowed to each\nother. Two minutes later, when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry,\nand, entering the pew, seated himself in face of Dorothea, Will felt\nhis paralysis more complete. He could look nowhere except at the choir\nin the little gallery over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps\npained, and he had made a wretched blunder. It was no longer amusing to\nvex Mr. Casaubon, who had the advantage probably of watching him and\nseeing that he dared not turn his head. Why had he not imagined this\nbeforehand?—but he could not expect that he should sit in that square\npew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently departed from\nLowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the desk. Still he called\nhimself stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be impossible for\nhim to look towards Dorothea—nay, that she might feel his coming an\nimpertinence. There was no delivering himself from his cage, however;\nand Will found his places and looked at his book as if he had been a\nschool-mistress, feeling that the morning service had never been so\nimmeasurably long before, that he was utterly ridiculous, out of\ntemper, and miserable. This was what a man got by worshipping the sight\nof a woman! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr. Ladislaw did not\njoin in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that he might have a cold."

There was a\nlittle heap of them on the table in the bow-window—of various sorts,\nfrom Herodotus, which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to\nher old companion Pascal, and Keble’s “Christian Year.” But to-day she\nopened one after another, and could read none of them. Everything\nseemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus—Jewish\nantiquities—oh dear!—devout epigrams—the sacred chime of favorite\nhymns—all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring\nflowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon\nclouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which\nhad become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future\ndays in which she would still live with them for her sole companions.\nIt was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor\nDorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual\neffort demanded by her married life. She was always trying to be what\nher husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she\nwas. The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have,\nseemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted\nand not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied. About\nWill Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first,\nand it had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed\nDorothea’s strong feeling about his claims on the family property, by\nher being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the\nwrong, but that she was helpless. This afternoon the helplessness was\nmore wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could\nbe dear to her, and to whom she could be dear. She longed for work\nwhich would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and\nnow it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb,\nwhere there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would\nnever see the light. Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and\nseen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and\nfellowship—turning his face towards her as he went."

It was Sunday, and she\ncould not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had a baby.\nThere was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent, and\nDorothea had to bear her bad mood, as she would have borne a headache.After dinner, at the hour when she usually began to read aloud, Mr.\nCasaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where, he said,\nhe had ordered a fire and lights. He seemed to have revived, and to be\nthinking intently.In the library Dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a row of\nhis note-books on a table, and now he took up and put into her hand a\nwell-known volume, which was a table of contents to all the others.“You will oblige me, my dear,” he said, seating himself, “if instead of\nother reading this evening, you will go through this aloud, pencil in\nhand, and at each point where I say ‘mark,’ will make a cross with your\npencil. This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long\nhad in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain\nprinciples of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent\nparticipation in my purpose.”This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable\ninterview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon’s original reluctance to let\nDorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition,\nnamely, to demand much interest and labor from her.After she had read and marked for two hours, he said, “We will take the\nvolume up-stairs—and the pencil, if you please—and in case of reading\nin the night, we can pursue this task. It is not wearisome to you, I\ntrust, Dorothea?”“I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,” said Dorothea,\nwho told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in\nreading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever."

  "content": "It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in\nDorothea impressed those around her, that her husband, with all his\njealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of\nher promises, and her power of devoting herself to her idea of the\nright and best. Of late he had begun to feel that these qualities were\na peculiar possession for himself, and he wanted to engross them.The reading in the night did come. Dorothea in her young weariness had\nslept soon and fast: she was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed\nto her at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she had climbed a\nsteep hill: she opened her eyes and saw her husband wrapped in his warm\ngown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the\nembers were still glowing. He had lit two candles, expecting that\nDorothea would awake, but not liking to rouse her by more direct means.“Are you ill, Edward?” she said, rising immediately.“I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture. I will sit here for a\ntime.” She threw wood on the fire, wrapped herself up, and said, “You\nwould like me to read to you?”“You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon,\nwith a shade more meekness than usual in his polite manner. “I am\nwakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid.”“I fear that the excitement may be too great for you,” said Dorothea,\nremembering Lydgate’s cautions.“No, I am not conscious of undue excitement. Thought is easy.” Dorothea\ndared not insist, and she read for an hour or more on the same plan as\nshe had done in the evening, but getting over the pages with more\nquickness. Mr. Casaubon’s mind was more alert, and he seemed to\nanticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication,\nsaying, “That will do—mark that”—or “Pass on to the next head—I omit\nthe second excursus on Crete.” Dorothea was amazed to think of the\nbird-like speed with which his mind was surveying the ground where it\nhad been creeping for years. At last he said—“Close the book now, my dear. We will resume our work to-morrow. I have\ndeferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed. But you\nobserve that the principle on which my selection is made, is to give\nadequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the theses\nenumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched. You have\nperceived that distinctly, Dorothea?”"

  "content": "“Yes,” said Dorothea, rather tremulously. She felt sick at heart.“And now I think that I can take some repose,” said Mr. Casaubon. He\nlaid down again and begged her to put out the lights. When she had lain\ndown too, and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on the\nhearth, he said—“Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea.”“What is it?” said Dorothea, with dread in her mind.“It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my\ndeath, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what\nI should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.”Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading her\nto the conjecture of some intention on her husband’s part which might\nmake a new yoke for her. She did not answer immediately.“You refuse?” said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his tone.“No, I do not yet refuse,” said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the need of\nfreedom asserting itself within her; “but it is too solemn—I think it\nis not right—to make a promise when I am ignorant what it will bind me\nto. Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising.”“But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you\nrefuse.”“No, dear, no!” said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.\n“But may I wait and reflect a little while? I desire with my whole soul\nto do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any pledge\nsuddenly—still less a pledge to do I know not what.”“You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?”“Grant me till to-morrow,” said Dorothea, beseechingly.“Till to-morrow then,” said Mr. Casaubon."

While she constrained herself to lie still lest she should\ndisturb him, her mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination\nranged its forces first on one side and then on the other. She had no\npresentiment that the power which her husband wished to establish over\nher future action had relation to anything else than his work. But it\nwas clear enough to her that he would expect her to devote herself to\nsifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the doubtful\nillustration of principles still more doubtful. The poor child had\nbecome altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key\nwhich had made the ambition and the labor of her husband’s life. It was\nnot wonderful that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment in\nthis matter was truer than his: for she looked with unbiassed\ncomparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had risked\nall his egoism. And now she pictured to herself the days, and months,\nand years which she must spend in sorting what might be called\nshattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a\nmosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for a theory\nwhich was already withered in the birth like an elfin child. Doubtless\na vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth\na-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of\nsubstances, the body of chemistry is prepared for its soul, and\nLavoisier is born. But Mr. Casaubon’s theory of the elements which made\nthe seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares\nagainst discoveries: it floated among flexible conjectures no more\nsolid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in\nsound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible:\nit was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity\nof forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate\nnotion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for\nthreading the stars together. And Dorothea had so often had to check\nher weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as\nit revealed itself to her instead of the fellowship in high knowledge\nwhich was to make life worthier! She could understand well enough now\nwhy her husband had come to cling to her, as possibly the only hope\nleft that his labors would ever take a shape in which they could be\ngiven to the world. At first it had seemed that he wished to keep even\nher aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing; but gradually\nthe terrible stringency of human need—the prospect of a too speedy\ndeath—"

  "content": "And here Dorothea’s pity turned from her own future to her husband’s\npast—nay, to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out\nof that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the\npressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs;\nand now at last the sword visibly trembling above him! And had she not\nwished to marry him that she might help him in his life’s labor?—But\nshe had thought the work was to be something greater, which she could\nserve in devoutly for its own sake. Was it right, even to soothe his\ngrief—would it be possible, even if she promised—to work as in a\ntreadmill fruitlessly?And yet, could she deny him? Could she say, “I refuse to content this\npining hunger?” It would be refusing to do for him dead, what she was\nalmost sure to do for him living. If he lived as Lydgate had said he\nmight, for fifteen years or more, her life would certainly be spent in\nhelping him and obeying him.Still, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living\nand that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead. While he lived, he\ncould claim nothing that she would not still be free to remonstrate\nagainst, and even to refuse. But—the thought passed through her mind\nmore than once, though she could not believe in it—might he not mean to\ndemand something more from her than she had been able to imagine, since\nhe wanted her pledge to carry out his wishes without telling her\nexactly what they were? No; his heart was bound up in his work only:\nthat was the end for which his failing life was to be eked out by hers.And now, if she were to say, “No! if you die, I will put no finger to\nyour work”—it seemed as if she would be crushing that bruised heart."

  "content": "For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she felt ill and\nbewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely. Helpless as a child\nwhich has sobbed and sought too long, she fell into a late morning\nsleep, and when she waked Mr. Casaubon was already up. Tantripp told\nher that he had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in the library.“I never saw you look so pale, madam,” said Tantripp, a solid-figured\nwoman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.“Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?” said Dorothea, smiling faintly.“Well, not to say high-colored, but with a bloom like a Chiny rose. But\nalways smelling those leather books, what can be expected? Do rest a\nlittle this morning, madam. Let me say you are ill and not able to go\ninto that close library.”“Oh no, no! let me make haste,” said Dorothea. “Mr. Casaubon wants me\nparticularly.”When she went down she felt sure that she should promise to fulfil his\nwishes; but that would be later in the day—not yet.As Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from the\ntable where he had been placing some books, and said—“I was waiting for your appearance, my dear. I had hoped to set to work\nat once this morning, but I find myself under some indisposition,\nprobably from too much excitement yesterday. I am going now to take a\nturn in the shrubbery, since the air is milder.”“I am glad to hear that,” said Dorothea. “Your mind, I feared, was too\nactive last night.”“I would fain have it set at rest on the point I last spoke of,\nDorothea. You can now, I hope, give me an answer.”“May I come out to you in the garden presently?” said Dorothea, winning\na little breathing space in that way.“I shall be in the Yew-tree Walk for the next half-hour,” said Mr.\nCasaubon, and then he left her.Dorothea, feeling very weary, rang and asked Tantripp to bring her some\nwraps. She had been sitting still for a few minutes, but not in any\nrenewal of the former conflict: she simply felt that she was going to\nsay “Yes” to her own doom: she was too weak, too full of dread at the\nthought of inflicting a keen-edged blow on her husband, to do anything\nbut submit completely. She sat still and let Tantripp put on her bonnet\nand shawl, a passivity which was unusual with her, for she liked to\nwait on herself."

  "content": "“God bless you, madam!” said Tantripp, with an irrepressible movement\nof love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom she felt unable\nto do anything more, now that she had finished tying the bonnet.This was too much for Dorothea’s highly-strung feeling, and she burst\ninto tears, sobbing against Tantripp’s arm. But soon she checked\nherself, dried her eyes, and went out at the glass door into the\nshrubbery.“I wish every book in that library was built into a caticom for your\nmaster,” said Tantripp to Pratt, the butler, finding him in the\nbreakfast-room. She had been at Rome, and visited the antiquities, as\nwe know; and she always declined to call Mr. Casaubon anything but\n“your master,” when speaking to the other servants.Pratt laughed. He liked his master very well, but he liked Tantripp\nbetter.When Dorothea was out on the gravel walks, she lingered among the\nnearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as she had done once before, though\nfrom a different cause. Then she had feared lest her effort at\nfellowship should be unwelcome; now she dreaded going to the spot where\nshe foresaw that she must bind herself to a fellowship from which she\nshrank. Neither law nor the world’s opinion compelled her to this—only\nher husband’s nature and her own compassion, only the ideal and not the\nreal yoke of marriage. She saw clearly enough the whole situation, yet\nshe was fettered: she could not smite the stricken soul that entreated\nhers. If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak. But the half-hour was\npassing, and she must not delay longer. When she entered the Yew-tree\nWalk she could not see her husband; but the walk had bends, and she\nwent, expecting to catch sight of his figure wrapped in a blue cloak,\nwhich, with a warm velvet cap, was his outer garment on chill days for\nthe garden. It occurred to her that he might be resting in the\nsummer-house, towards which the path diverged a little. Turning the\nangle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a stone table.\nHis arms were resting on the table, and his brow was bowed down on\nthem, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening his face on\neach side."

  "content": "“He exhausted himself last night,” Dorothea said to herself, thinking\nat first that he was asleep, and that the summer-house was too damp a\nplace to rest in. But then she remembered that of late she had seen him\ntake that attitude when she was reading to him, as if he found it\neasier than any other; and that he would sometimes speak, as well as\nlisten, with his face down in that way. She went into the summerhouse\nand said, “I am come, Edward; I am ready.”He took no notice, and she thought that he must be fast asleep. She\nlaid her hand on his shoulder, and repeated, “I am ready!” Still he was\nmotionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she leaned down to him,\ntook off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying\nin a distressed tone—“Wake, dear, wake! Listen to me. I am come to answer.” But Dorothea\nnever gave her answer.Later in the day, Lydgate was seated by her bedside, and she was\ntalking deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone\nthrough her mind the night before. She knew him, and called him by his\nname, but appeared to think it right that she should explain everything\nto him; and again, and again, begged him to explain everything to her\nhusband.“Tell him I shall go to him soon: I am ready to promise. Only, thinking\nabout it was so dreadful—it has made me ill. Not very ill. I shall soon\nbe better. Go and tell him.”But the silence in her husband’s ear was never more to be broken.CHAPTER XLIX.“A task too strong for wizard spells\nThis squire had brought about;\n’T is easy dropping stones in wells,\nBut who shall get them out?”“I wish to God we could hinder Dorothea from knowing this,” said Sir\nJames Chettam, with a little frown on his brow, and an expression of\nintense disgust about his mouth.He was standing on the hearth-rug in the library at Lowick Grange, and\nspeaking to Mr. Brooke. It was the day after Mr. Casaubon had been\nburied, and Dorothea was not yet able to leave her room.“That would be difficult, you know, Chettam, as she is an executrix,\nand she likes to go into these things—property, land, that kind of\nthing. She has her notions, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, sticking his\neye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the edges of a folded paper\nwhich he held in his hand; “and she would like to act—depend upon it,\nas an executrix Dorothea would want to act. And she was twenty-one last\nDecember, you know. I can hinder nothing.”"
