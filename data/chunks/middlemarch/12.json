  "content": "Will wrote from Rome, and began by saying that his obligations to Mr.\nCasaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent. It was\nplain that if he were not grateful, he must be the poorest-spirited\nrascal who had ever found a generous friend. To expand in wordy thanks\nwould be like saying, “I am honest.” But Will had come to perceive that\nhis defects—defects which Mr. Casaubon had himself often pointed\nto—needed for their correction that more strenuous position which his\nrelative’s generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable. He\ntrusted that he should make the best return, if return were possible,\nby showing the effectiveness of the education for which he was\nindebted, and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards\nhimself of funds on which others might have a better claim. He was\ncoming to England, to try his fortune, as many other young men were\nobliged to do whose only capital was in their brains. His friend\nNaumann had desired him to take charge of the “Dispute”—the picture\npainted for Mr. Casaubon, with whose permission, and Mrs. Casaubon’s,\nWill would convey it to Lowick in person. A letter addressed to the\nPoste Restante in Paris within the fortnight would hinder him, if\nnecessary, from arriving at an inconvenient moment. He enclosed a\nletter to Mrs. Casaubon in which he continued a discussion about art,\nbegun with her in Rome.Opening her own letter Dorothea saw that it was a lively continuation\nof his remonstrance with her fanatical sympathy and her want of sturdy\nneutral delight in things as they were—an outpouring of his young\nvivacity which it was impossible to read just now. She had immediately\nto consider what was to be done about the other letter: there was still\ntime perhaps to prevent Will from coming to Lowick. Dorothea ended by\ngiving the letter to her uncle, who was still in the house, and begging\nhim to let Will know that Mr. Casaubon had been ill, and that his\nhealth would not allow the reception of any visitors.No one more ready than Mr. Brooke to write a letter: his only\ndifficulty was to write a short one, and his ideas in this case\nexpanded over the three large pages and the inward foldings. He had\nsimply said to Dorothea—“To be sure, I will write, my dear. He’s a very clever young\nfellow—this young Ladislaw—I dare say will be a rising young man. It’s\na good letter—marks his sense of things, you know. However, I will tell\nhim about Casaubon.”"

  "content": "But the end of Mr. Brooke’s pen was a thinking organ, evolving\nsentences, especially of a benevolent kind, before the rest of his mind\ncould well overtake them. It expressed regrets and proposed remedies,\nwhich, when Mr. Brooke read them, seemed felicitously\nworded—surprisingly the right thing, and determined a sequel which he\nhad never before thought of. In this case, his pen found it such a pity\nyoung Ladislaw should not have come into the neighborhood just at that\ntime, in order that Mr. Brooke might make his acquaintance more fully,\nand that they might go over the long-neglected Italian drawings\ntogether—it also felt such an interest in a young man who was starting\nin life with a stock of ideas—that by the end of the second page it had\npersuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw, since he could not be\nreceived at Lowick, to come to Tipton Grange. Why not? They could find\na great many things to do together, and this was a period of peculiar\ngrowth—the political horizon was expanding, and—in short, Mr. Brooke’s\npen went off into a little speech which it had lately reported for that\nimperfectly edited organ the “Middlemarch Pioneer.” While Mr. Brooke\nwas sealing this letter, he felt elated with an influx of dim\nprojects:—a young man capable of putting ideas into form, the “Pioneer”\npurchased to clear the pathway for a new candidate, documents\nutilized—who knew what might come of it all? Since Celia was going to\nmarry immediately, it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at\ntable with him, at least for a time.But he went away without telling Dorothea what he had put into the\nletter, for she was engaged with her husband, and—in fact, these things\nwere of no importance to her.CHAPTER XXXI.How will you know the pitch of that great bell\nToo large for you to stir? Let but a flute\nPlay ’neath the fine-mixed metal: listen close\nTill the right note flows forth, a silvery rill:\nThen shall the huge bell tremble—then the mass\nWith myriad waves concurrent shall respond\nIn low soft unison.Lydgate that evening spoke to Miss Vincy of Mrs. Casaubon, and laid\nsome emphasis on the strong feeling she appeared to have for that\nformal studious man thirty years older than herself.“Of course she is devoted to her husband,” said Rosamond, implying a\nnotion of necessary sequence which the scientific man regarded as the\nprettiest possible for a woman; but she was thinking at the same time\nthat it was not so very melancholy to be mistress of Lowick Manor with\na husband likely to die soon. “Do you think her very handsome?”“She certainly is handsome, but I have not thought about it,” said\nLydgate.“I suppose it would be unprofessional,” said Rosamond, dimpling. “But\nhow your practice is spreading! You were called in before to the\nChettams, I think; and now, the Casaubons.”“Yes,” said Lydgate, in a tone of compulsory admission. “But I don’t\nreally like attending such people so well as the poor. The cases are\nmore monotonous, and one has to go through more fuss and listen more\ndeferentially to nonsense.”“Not more than in Middlemarch,” said Rosamond. “And at least you go\nthrough wide corridors and have the scent of rose-leaves everywhere.”“That is true, Mademoiselle de Montmorenci,” said Lydgate, just bending\nhis head to the table and lifting with his fourth finger her delicate\nhandkerchief which lay at the mouth of her reticule, as if to enjoy its\nscent, while he looked at her with a smile."

  "content": "But this agreeable holiday freedom with which Lydgate hovered about the\nflower of Middlemarch, could not continue indefinitely. It was not more\npossible to find social isolation in that town than elsewhere, and two\npeople persistently flirting could by no means escape from “the various\nentanglements, weights, blows, clashings, motions, by which things\nseverally go on.” Whatever Miss Vincy did must be remarked, and she was\nperhaps the more conspicuous to admirers and critics because just now\nMrs. Vincy, after some struggle, had gone with Fred to stay a little\nwhile at Stone Court, there being no other way of at once gratifying\nold Featherstone and keeping watch against Mary Garth, who appeared a\nless tolerable daughter-in-law in proportion as Fred’s illness\ndisappeared.Aunt Bulstrode, for example, came a little oftener into Lowick Gate to\nsee Rosamond, now she was alone. For Mrs. Bulstrode had a true sisterly\nfeeling for her brother; always thinking that he might have married\nbetter, but wishing well to the children. Now Mrs. Bulstrode had a\nlong-standing intimacy with Mrs. Plymdale. They had nearly the same\npreferences in silks, patterns for underclothing, china-ware, and\nclergymen; they confided their little troubles of health and household\nmanagement to each other, and various little points of superiority on\nMrs. Bulstrode’s side, namely, more decided seriousness, more\nadmiration for mind, and a house outside the town, sometimes served to\ngive color to their conversation without dividing them—well-meaning\nwomen both, knowing very little of their own motives.Mrs. Bulstrode, paying a morning visit to Mrs. Plymdale, happened to\nsay that she could not stay longer, because she was going to see poor\nRosamond.“Why do you say ‘poor Rosamond’?” said Mrs. Plymdale, a round-eyed\nsharp little woman, like a tamed falcon.“She is so pretty, and has been brought up in such thoughtlessness. The\nmother, you know, had always that levity about her, which makes me\nanxious for the children.”“Well, Harriet, if I am to speak my mind,” said Mrs. Plymdale, with\nemphasis, “I must say, anybody would suppose you and Mr. Bulstrode\nwould be delighted with what has happened, for you have done everything\nto put Mr. Lydgate forward.”“Selina, what do you mean?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in genuine surprise.“Not but what I am truly thankful for Ned’s sake,” said Mrs. Plymdale.\n“He could certainly better afford to keep such a wife than some people\ncan; but I should wish him to look elsewhere. Still a mother has\nanxieties, and some young men would take to a bad life in consequence.\nBesides, if I was obliged to speak, I should say I was not fond of\nstrangers coming into a town.”"

Abraham and\nMoses were strangers in the land, and we are told to entertain\nstrangers. And especially,” she added, after a slight pause, “when they\nare unexceptionable.”“I was not speaking in a religious sense, Harriet. I spoke as a\nmother.”“Selina, I am sure you have never heard me say anything against a niece\nof mine marrying your son.”“Oh, it is pride in Miss Vincy—I am sure it is nothing else,” said Mrs.\nPlymdale, who had never before given all her confidence to “Harriet” on\nthis subject. “No young man in Middlemarch was good enough for her: I\nhave heard her mother say as much. That is not a Christian spirit, I\nthink. But now, from all I hear, she has found a man as proud as\nherself.”“You don’t mean that there is anything between Rosamond and Mr.\nLydgate?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, rather mortified at finding out her own\nignorance.“Is it possible you don’t know, Harriet?”“Oh, I go about so little; and I am not fond of gossip; I really never\nhear any. You see so many people that I don’t see. Your circle is\nrather different from ours.”“Well, but your own niece and Mr. Bulstrode’s great favorite—and yours\ntoo, I am sure, Harriet! I thought, at one time, you meant him for\nKate, when she is a little older.”“I don’t believe there can be anything serious at present,” said Mrs.\nBulstrode. “My brother would certainly have told me.”“Well, people have different ways, but I understand that nobody can see\nMiss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate together without taking them to be engaged.\nHowever, it is not my business. Shall I put up the pattern of mittens?”After this Mrs. Bulstrode drove to her niece with a mind newly\nweighted. She was herself handsomely dressed, but she noticed with a\nlittle more regret than usual that Rosamond, who was just come in and\nmet her in walking-dress, was almost as expensively equipped. Mrs.\nBulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of her brother, and had none\nof her husband’s low-toned pallor. She had a good honest glance and\nused no circumlocution."

Rosamond felt sure that\nher aunt had something particular to say, and they sat down near each\nother. Nevertheless, the quilling inside Rosamond’s bonnet was so\ncharming that it was impossible not to desire the same kind of thing\nfor Kate, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes, which were rather fine, rolled\nround that ample quilled circuit, while she spoke.“I have just heard something about you that has surprised me very much,\nRosamond.”“What is that, aunt?” Rosamond’s eyes also were roaming over her aunt’s\nlarge embroidered collar.“I can hardly believe it—that you should be engaged without my knowing\nit—without your father’s telling me.” Here Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes\nfinally rested on Rosamond’s, who blushed deeply, and said—“I am not engaged, aunt.”“How is it that every one says so, then—that it is the town’s talk?”“The town’s talk is of very little consequence, I think,” said\nRosamond, inwardly gratified.“Oh, my dear, be more thoughtful; don’t despise your neighbors so.\nRemember you are turned twenty-two now, and you will have no fortune:\nyour father, I am sure, will not be able to spare you anything. Mr.\nLydgate is very intellectual and clever; I know there is an attraction\nin that. I like talking to such men myself; and your uncle finds him\nvery useful. But the profession is a poor one here. To be sure, this\nlife is not everything; but it is seldom a medical man has true\nreligious views—there is too much pride of intellect. And you are not\nfit to marry a poor man.“Mr. Lydgate is not a poor man, aunt. He has very high connections.”“He told me himself he was poor.”“That is because he is used to people who have a high style of living.”“My dear Rosamond, _you_ must not think of living in high style.”Rosamond looked down and played with her reticule. She was not a fiery\nyoung lady and had no sharp answers, but she meant to live as she\npleased.“Then it is really true?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking very earnestly\nat her niece. “You are thinking of Mr. Lydgate—there is some\nunderstanding between you, though your father doesn’t know. Be open, my\ndear Rosamond: Mr. Lydgate has really made you an offer?”"

She had been quite easy\nas to Lydgate’s feeling and intention, but now when her aunt put this\nquestion she did not like being unable to say Yes. Her pride was hurt,\nbut her habitual control of manner helped her.“Pray excuse me, aunt. I would rather not speak on the subject.”“You would not give your heart to a man without a decided prospect, I\ntrust, my dear. And think of the two excellent offers I know of that\nyou have refused!—and one still within your reach, if you will not\nthrow it away. I knew a very great beauty who married badly at last, by\ndoing so. Mr. Ned Plymdale is a nice young man—some might think\ngood-looking; and an only son; and a large business of that kind is\nbetter than a profession. Not that marrying is everything. I would have\nyou seek first the kingdom of God. But a girl should keep her heart\nwithin her own power.”“I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were. I have already\nrefused him. If I loved, I should love at once and without change,”\nsaid Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and\nplaying the part prettily.“I see how it is, my dear,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy voice,\nrising to go. “You have allowed your affections to be engaged without\nreturn.”“No, indeed, aunt,” said Rosamond, with emphasis.“Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious attachment\nto you?”Rosamond’s cheeks by this time were persistently burning, and she felt\nmuch mortification. She chose to be silent, and her aunt went away all\nthe more convinced."

  "content": "Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to do what\nhis wife bade him, and she now, without telling her reasons, desired\nhim on the next opportunity to find out in conversation with Mr.\nLydgate whether he had any intention of marrying soon. The result was a\ndecided negative. Mr. Bulstrode, on being cross-questioned, showed that\nLydgate had spoken as no man would who had any attachment that could\nissue in matrimony. Mrs. Bulstrode now felt that she had a serious duty\nbefore her, and she soon managed to arrange a _tête-à-tête_ with\nLydgate, in which she passed from inquiries about Fred Vincy’s health,\nand expressions of her sincere anxiety for her brother’s large family,\nto general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with\nregard to their settlement in life. Young men were often wild and\ndisappointing, making little return for the money spent on them, and a\ngirl was exposed to many circumstances which might interfere with her\nprospects.“Especially when she has great attractions, and her parents see much\ncompany,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “Gentlemen pay her attention, and\nengross her all to themselves, for the mere pleasure of the moment, and\nthat drives off others. I think it is a heavy responsibility, Mr.\nLydgate, to interfere with the prospects of any girl.” Here Mrs.\nBulstrode fixed her eyes on him, with an unmistakable purpose of\nwarning, if not of rebuke.“Clearly,” said Lydgate, looking at her—perhaps even staring a little\nin return. “On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go\nabout with a notion that he must not pay attention to a young lady lest\nshe should fall in love with him, or lest others should think she\nmust.”“Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are. You know that\nour young men here cannot cope with you. Where you frequent a house it\nmay militate very much against a girl’s making a desirable settlement\nin life, and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made.”Lydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the Middlemarch\nOrlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of Mrs. Bulstrode’s\nmeaning. She felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was\nnecessary to do, and that in using the superior word “militate” she had\nthrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still\nevident enough.Lydgate was fuming a little, pushed his hair back with one hand, felt\ncuriously in his waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then stooped to\nbeckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to decline his\nhollow caresses. It would not have been decent to go away, because he\nhad been dining with other guests, and had just taken tea. But Mrs.\nBulstrode, having no doubt that she had been understood, turned the\nconversation."

  "content": "Solomon’s Proverbs, I think, have omitted to say, that as the sore\npalate findeth grit, so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes. The\nnext day Mr. Farebrother, parting from Lydgate in the street, supposed\nthat they should meet at Vincy’s in the evening. Lydgate answered\ncurtly, no—he had work to do—he must give up going out in the evening.“What! you are going to get lashed to the mast, eh, and are stopping\nyour ears?” said the Vicar. “Well, if you don’t mean to be won by the\nsirens, you are right to take precautions in time.”A few days before, Lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as\nanything more than the Vicar’s usual way of putting things. They seemed\nnow to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had\nbeen making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood:\nnot, he believed, by Rosamond herself; she, he felt sure, took\neverything as lightly as he intended it. She had an exquisite tact and\ninsight in relation to all points of manners; but the people she lived\namong were blunderers and busybodies. However, the mistake should go no\nfarther. He resolved—and kept his resolution—that he would not go to\nMr. Vincy’s except on business.Rosamond became very unhappy. The uneasiness first stirred by her\naunt’s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had\nnot seen Lydgate, it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly\ncome—into foreboding of that ready, fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes\nout the hopes of mortals. The world would have a new dreariness for\nher, as a wilderness that a magician’s spells had turned for a little\nwhile into a garden. She felt that she was beginning to know the pang\nof disappointed love, and that no other man could be the occasion of\nsuch delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last\nsix months. Poor Rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as\nAriadne—as a charming stage Ariadne left behind with all her boxes full\nof costumes and no hope of a coach."

  "content": "There are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike\ncalled love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an\napology for everything (in literature and the drama). Happily Rosamond\ndid not think of committing any desperate act: she plaited her fair\nhair as beautifully as usual, and kept herself proudly calm. Her most\ncheerful supposition was that her aunt Bulstrode had interfered in some\nway to hinder Lydgate’s visits: everything was better than a\nspontaneous indifference in him. Any one who imagines ten days too\nshort a time—not for falling into leanness, lightness, or other\nmeasurable effects of passion, but—for the whole spiritual circuit of\nalarmed conjecture and disappointment, is ignorant of what can go on in\nthe elegant leisure of a young lady’s mind.On the eleventh day, however, Lydgate when leaving Stone Court was\nrequested by Mrs. Vincy to let her husband know that there was a marked\nchange in Mr. Featherstone’s health, and that she wished him to come to\nStone Court on that day. Now Lydgate might have called at the\nwarehouse, or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket-book\nand left it at the door. Yet these simple devices apparently did not\noccur to him, from which we may conclude that he had no strong\nobjection to calling at the house at an hour when Mr. Vincy was not at\nhome, and leaving the message with Miss Vincy. A man may, from various\nmotives, decline to give his company, but perhaps not even a sage would\nbe gratified that nobody missed him. It would be a graceful, easy way\nof piecing on the new habits to the old, to have a few playful words\nwith Rosamond about his resistance to dissipation, and his firm resolve\nto take long fasts even from sweet sounds. It must be confessed, also,\nthat momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for Mrs.\nBulstrode’s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs\ninto the more substantial web of his thoughts."

  "content": "Miss Vincy was alone, and blushed so deeply when Lydgate came in that\nhe felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any playfulness,\nhe began at once to speak of his reason for calling, and to beg her,\nalmost formally, to deliver the message to her father. Rosamond, who at\nthe first moment felt as if her happiness were returning, was keenly\nhurt by Lydgate’s manner; her blush had departed, and she assented\ncoldly, without adding an unnecessary word, some trivial chain-work\nwhich she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at Lydgate\nhigher than his chin. In all failures, the beginning is certainly the\nhalf of the whole. After sitting two long moments while he moved his\nwhip and could say nothing, Lydgate rose to go, and Rosamond, made\nnervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to\nbetray it, dropped her chain as if startled, and rose too,\nmechanically. Lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain.\nWhen he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair\nlong neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most\nperfect management of self-contented grace. But as he raised his eyes\nnow he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly,\nand made him look at Rosamond with a questioning flash. At this moment\nshe was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old:\nshe felt that her tears had risen, and it was no use to try to do\nanything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let\nthem fall over her cheeks, even as they would.That moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch: it\nshook flirtation into love. Remember that the ambitious man who was\nlooking at those Forget-me-nots under the water was very warm-hearted\nand rash. He did not know where the chain went; an idea had thrilled\nthrough the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in\nraising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed\nsepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould. His words were\nquite abrupt and awkward; but the tone made them sound like an ardent,\nappealing avowal.“What is the matter? you are distressed. Tell me, pray.”Rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before. I am not sure\nthat she knew what the words were: but she looked at Lydgate and the\ntears fell over her cheeks. There could have been no more complete\nanswer than that silence, and Lydgate, forgetting everything else,\ncompletely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief\nthat this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy, actually\nput his arms round her, folding her gently and protectingly—he was used\nto being gentle with the weak and suffering—and kissed each of the two\nlarge tears. This was a strange way of arriving at an understanding,\nbut it was a short way. Rosamond was not angry, but she moved backward\na little in timid happiness, and Lydgate could now sit near her and\nspeak less incompletely. Rosamond had to make her little confession,\nand he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive\nlavishment. In half an hour he left the house an engaged man, whose\nsoul was not his own, but the woman’s to whom he had bound himself."

The felicitous word\n“demise,” which had seasonably occurred to him, had raised his spirits\neven above their usual evening pitch. The right word is always a power,\nand communicates its definiteness to our action. Considered as a\ndemise, old Featherstone’s death assumed a merely legal aspect, so that\nMr. Vincy could tap his snuff-box over it and be jovial, without even\nan intermittent affectation of solemnity; and Mr. Vincy hated both\nsolemnity and affectation. Who was ever awe struck about a testator, or\nsang a hymn on the title to real property? Mr. Vincy was inclined to\ntake a jovial view of all things that evening: he even observed to\nLydgate that Fred had got the family constitution after all, and would\nsoon be as fine a fellow as ever again; and when his approbation of\nRosamond’s engagement was asked for, he gave it with astonishing\nfacility, passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of\nmatrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from the\nwhole the appropriateness of a little more punch.CHAPTER XXXII.They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Tempest_.The triumphant confidence of the Mayor founded on Mr. Featherstone’s\ninsistent demand that Fred and his mother should not leave him, was a\nfeeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the\nold man’s blood-relations, who naturally manifested more their sense of\nthe family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he had become\nbedridden. Naturally: for when “poor Peter” had occupied his arm-chair\nin the wainscoted parlor, no assiduous beetles for whom the cook\nprepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which\nthey had reasons for preferring, than those persons whose Featherstone\nblood was ill-nourished, not from penuriousness on their part, but from\npoverty. Brother Solomon and Sister Jane were rich, and the family\ncandor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were\nalways received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the\nsolemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of\nwealth. Themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to\nbanish from his house, and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should\nhave kept away Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and the rest, who had no\nshadow of such claims. They knew Peter’s maxim, that money was a good\negg, and should be laid in a warm nest."

Probabilities are as various as the faces to\nbe seen at will in fretwork or paper-hangings: every form is there,\nfrom Jupiter to Judy, if you only look with creative inclination. To\nthe poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since Peter had done\nnothing for them in his life, he would remember them at the last. Jonah\nargued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills, while Martha\nsaid that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his\nmoney to those who least expected it. Also it was not to be thought but\nthat an own brother “lying there” with dropsy in his legs must come to\nfeel that blood was thicker than water, and if he didn’t alter his\nwill, he might have money by him. At any rate some blood-relations\nshould be on the premises and on the watch against those who were\nhardly relations at all. Such things had been known as forged wills and\ndisputed wills, which seemed to have the golden-hazy advantage of\nsomehow enabling non-legatees to live out of them. Again, those who\nwere no blood-relations might be caught making away with things—and\npoor Peter “lying there” helpless! Somebody should be on the watch. But\nin this conclusion they were at one with Solomon and Jane; also, some\nnephews, nieces, and cousins, arguing with still greater subtilty as to\nwhat might be done by a man able to “will away” his property and give\nhimself large treats of oddity, felt in a handsome sort of way that\nthere was a family interest to be attended to, and thought of Stone\nCourt as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit.\nSister Martha, otherwise Mrs. Cranch, living with some wheeziness in\nthe Chalky Flats, could not undertake the journey; but her son, as\nbeing poor Peter’s own nephew, could represent her advantageously, and\nwatch lest his uncle Jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable\nthings which seemed likely to happen.

Brother Jonah, for example (there are such\nunpleasant people in most families; perhaps even in the highest\naristocracy there are Brobdingnag specimens, gigantically in debt and\nbloated at greater expense)—Brother Jonah, I say, having come down in\nthe world, was mainly supported by a calling which he was modest enough\nnot to boast of, though it was much better than swindling either on\nexchange or turf, but which did not require his presence at Brassing so\nlong as he had a good corner to sit in and a supply of food. He chose\nthe kitchen-corner, partly because he liked it best, and partly because\nhe did not want to sit with Solomon, concerning whom he had a strong\nbrotherly opinion. Seated in a famous arm-chair and in his best suit,\nconstantly within sight of good cheer, he had a comfortable\nconsciousness of being on the premises, mingled with fleeting\nsuggestions of Sunday and the bar at the Green Man; and he informed\nMary Garth that he should not go out of reach of his brother Peter\nwhile that poor fellow was above ground. The troublesome ones in a\nfamily are usually either the wits or the idiots. Jonah was the wit\namong the Featherstones, and joked with the maid-servants when they\ncame about the hearth, but seemed to consider Miss Garth a suspicious\ncharacter, and followed her with cold eyes.Mary would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative ease, but\nunfortunately there was young Cranch, who, having come all the way from\nthe Chalky Flats to represent his mother and watch his uncle Jonah,\nalso felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give\nhis uncle company. Young Cranch was not exactly the balancing point\nbetween the wit and the idiot,—verging slightly towards the latter\ntype, and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his\nsentiments except that they were not of a forcible character. When Mary\nGarth entered the kitchen and Mr. Jonah Featherstone began to follow\nher with his cold detective eyes, young Cranch turning his head in the\nsame direction seemed to insist on it that she should remark how he was\nsquinting, as if he did it with design, like the gypsies when Borrow\nread the New Testament to them. This was rather too much for poor Mary;\nsometimes it made her bilious, sometimes it upset her gravity. One day\nthat she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the kitchen\nscene to Fred, who would not be hindered from immediately going to see\nit, affecting simply to pass through. But no sooner did he face the\nfour eyes than he had to rush through the nearest door which happened\nto lead to the dairy, and there under the high roof and among the pans\nhe gave way to laughter which made a hollow resonance perfectly audible\nin the kitchen. He fled by another doorway, but Mr. Jonah, who had not\nbefore seen Fred’s white complexion, long legs, and pinched delicacy of\nface, prepared many sarcasms in which these points of appearance were\nwittily combined with the lowest moral attributes."

Tom looked at his legs, but left it\nuncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious\nlength of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser.In the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes\non the watch, and own relatives eager to be “sitters-up.” Many came,\nlunched, and departed, but Brother Solomon and the lady who had been\nJane Featherstone for twenty-five years before she was Mrs. Waule found\nit good to be there every day for hours, without other calculable\noccupation than that of observing the cunning Mary Garth (who was so\ndeep that she could be found out in nothing) and giving occasional dry\nwrinkly indications of crying—as if capable of torrents in a wetter\nseason—at the thought that they were not allowed to go into Mr.\nFeatherstone’s room. For the old man’s dislike of his own family seemed\nto get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting\nthings to them. Too languid to sting, he had the more venom refluent in\nhis blood.Not fully believing the message sent through Mary Garth, they had\npresented themselves together within the door of the bedroom, both in\nblack—Mrs. Waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her\nhand—and both with faces in a sort of half-mourning purple; while Mrs.\nVincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually\nadministering a cordial to their own brother, and the\nlight-complexioned Fred, his short hair curling as might be expected in\na gambler’s, was lolling at his ease in a large chair.Old Featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures\nappearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more\nsuccessfully than the cordial. He was propped up on a bed-rest, and\nalways had his gold-headed stick lying by him. He seized it now and\nswept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could,\napparently to ban these ugly spectres, crying in a hoarse sort of\nscreech—“Back, back, Mrs. Waule! Back, Solomon!”"

  "content": "“Oh, Brother. Peter,” Mrs. Waule began—but Solomon put his hand before\nher repressingly. He was a large-cheeked man, nearly seventy, with\nsmall furtive eyes, and was not only of much blander temper but thought\nhimself much deeper than his brother Peter; indeed not likely to be\ndeceived in any of his fellow-men, inasmuch as they could not well be\nmore greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being. Even the\ninvisible powers, he thought, were likely to be soothed by a bland\nparenthesis here and there—coming from a man of property, who might\nhave been as impious as others.“Brother Peter,” he said, in a wheedling yet gravely official tone,\n“It’s nothing but right I should speak to you about the Three Crofts\nand the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I’ve got on my mind—”“Then he knows more than I want to know,” said Peter, laying down his\nstick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too, for he\nreversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of\ncloser fighting, and looked hard at Solomon’s bald head.“There’s things you might repent of, Brother, for want of speaking to\nme,” said Solomon, not advancing, however. “I could sit up with you\nto-night, and Jane with me, willingly, and you might take your own time\nto speak, or let me speak.”“Yes, I shall take my own time—you needn’t offer me yours,” said Peter.“But you can’t take your own time to die in, Brother,” began Mrs.\nWaule, with her usual woolly tone. “And when you lie speechless you may\nbe tired of having strangers about you, and you may think of me and my\nchildren”—but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she\nwas attributing to her speechless brother; the mention of ourselves\nbeing naturally affecting.“No, I shan’t,” said old Featherstone, contradictiously. “I shan’t\nthink of any of you. I’ve made my will, I tell you, I’ve made my will.”\nHere he turned his head towards Mrs. Vincy, and swallowed some more of\nhis cordial.“Some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to\nothers,” said Mrs. Waule, turning her narrow eyes in the same\ndirection.“Oh, sister,” said Solomon, with ironical softness, “you and me are not\nfine, and handsome, and clever enough: we must be humble and let smart\npeople push themselves before us.”Fred’s spirit could not bear this: rising and looking at Mr.\nFeatherstone, he said, “Shall my mother and I leave the room, sir, that\nyou may be alone with your friends?”"

Good-by, Solomon,” he added, trying to wield his stick again,\nbut failing now that he had reversed the handle. “Good-by, Mrs. Waule.\nDon’t you come again.”“I shall be down-stairs, Brother, whether or no,” said Solomon. “I\nshall do my duty, and it remains to be seen what the Almighty will\nallow.”“Yes, in property going out of families,” said Mrs. Waule, in\ncontinuation,—“and where there’s steady young men to carry on. But I\npity them who are not such, and I pity their mothers. Good-by, Brother\nPeter.”“Remember, I’m the eldest after you, Brother, and prospered from the\nfirst, just as you did, and have got land already by the name of\nFeatherstone,” said Solomon, relying much on that reflection, as one\nwhich might be suggested in the watches of the night. “But I bid you\ngood-by for the present.”Their exit was hastened by their seeing old Mr. Featherstone pull his\nwig on each side and shut his eyes with his mouth-widening grimace, as\nif he were determined to be deaf and blind.None the less they came to Stone Court daily and sat below at the post\nof duty, sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an undertone in which\nthe observation and response were so far apart, that any one hearing\nthem might have imagined himself listening to speaking automata, in\nsome doubt whether the ingenious mechanism would really work, or wind\nitself up for a long time in order to stick and be silent. Solomon and\nJane would have been sorry to be quick: what that led to might be seen\non the other side of the wall in the person of Brother Jonah."

Now that Peter Featherstone\nwas up-stairs, his property could be discussed with all that local\nenlightenment to be found on the spot: some rural and Middlemarch\nneighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with\ntheir interest against the Vincys, and feminine visitors were even\nmoved to tears, in conversation with Mrs. Waule, when they recalled the\nfact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by\ncodicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly\ngentlemen, who, it might have been supposed, had been spared for\nsomething better. Such conversation paused suddenly, like an organ when\nthe bellows are let drop, if Mary Garth came into the room; and all\neyes were turned on her as a possible legatee, or one who might get\naccess to iron chests.But the younger men who were relatives or connections of the family,\nwere disposed to admire her in this problematic light, as a girl who\nshowed much conduct, and who among all the chances that were flying\nmight turn out to be at least a moderate prize. Hence she had her share\nof compliments and polite attentions."

He was second cousin to Peter Featherstone, and\nhad been treated by him with more amenity than any other relative,\nbeing useful in matters of business; and in that programme of his\nfuneral which the old man had himself dictated, he had been named as a\nBearer. There was no odious cupidity in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull—nothing\nmore than a sincere sense of his own merit, which, he was aware, in\ncase of rivalry might tell against competitors; so that if Peter\nFeatherstone, who so far as he, Trumbull, was concerned, had behaved\nlike as good a soul as ever breathed, should have done anything\nhandsome by him, all he could say was, that he had never fished and\nfawned, but had advised him to the best of his experience, which now\nextended over twenty years from the time of his apprenticeship at\nfifteen, and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind.\nHis admiration was far from being confined to himself, but was\naccustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating\nthings at a high rate. He was an amateur of superior phrases, and never\nused poor language without immediately correcting himself—which was\nfortunate, as he was rather loud, and given to predominate, standing or\nwalking about frequently, pulling down his waistcoat with the air of a\nman who is very much of his own opinion, trimming himself rapidly with\nhis fore-finger, and marking each new series in these movements by a\nbusy play with his large seals. There was occasionally a little\nfierceness in his demeanor, but it was directed chiefly against false\nopinion, of which there is so much to correct in the world that a man\nof some reading and experience necessarily has his patience tried. He\nfelt that the Featherstone family generally was of limited\nunderstanding, but being a man of the world and a public character,\ntook everything as a matter of course, and even went to converse with\nMr. Jonah and young Cranch in the kitchen, not doubting that he had\nimpressed the latter greatly by his leading questions concerning the\nChalky Flats. If anybody had observed that Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, being\nan auctioneer, was bound to know the nature of everything, he would\nhave smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came\npretty near that. On the whole, in an auctioneering way, he was an\nhonorable man, not ashamed of his business, and feeling that “the\ncelebrated Peel, now Sir Robert,” if introduced to him, would not fail\nto recognize his importance."

Any one\nmay give their remarks an interrogative turn,” he continued, his\nsonorousness rising with his style. “This is constantly done by good\nspeakers, even when they anticipate no answer. It is what we call a\nfigure of speech—speech at a high figure, as one may say.” The eloquent\nauctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity.“I shouldn’t be sorry to hear he’d remembered you, Mr. Trumbull,” said\nSolomon. “I never was against the deserving. It’s the undeserving I’m\nagainst.”“Ah, there it is, you see, there it is,” said Mr. Trumbull,\nsignificantly. “It can’t be denied that undeserving people have been\nlegatees, and even residuary legatees. It is so, with testamentary\ndispositions.” Again he pursed up his lips and frowned a little.“Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother has left\nhis land away from our family?” said Mrs. Waule, on whom, as an\nunhopeful woman, those long words had a depressing effect."

It would be flying in the face of the\nAlmighty that’s prospered him.”While Mrs. Waule was speaking, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull walked away from\nthe fireplace towards the window, patrolling with his fore-finger round\nthe inside of his stock, then along his whiskers and the curves of his\nhair. He now walked to Miss Garth’s work-table, opened a book which lay\nthere and read the title aloud with pompous emphasis as if he were\noffering it for sale:“‘Anne of Geierstein’ (pronounced Jeersteen) or the ‘Maiden of the\nMist, by the author of Waverley.’” Then turning the page, he began\nsonorously—“The course of four centuries has well-nigh elapsed since\nthe series of events which are related in the following chapters took\nplace on the Continent.” He pronounced the last truly admirable word\nwith the accent on the last syllable, not as unaware of vulgar usage,\nbut feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the sonorous beauty which\nhis reading had given to the whole.And now the servant came in with the tray, so that the moments for\nanswering Mrs. Waule’s question had gone by safely, while she and\nSolomon, watching Mr. Trumbull’s movements, were thinking that high\nlearning interfered sadly with serious affairs. Mr. Borthrop Trumbull\nreally knew nothing about old Featherstone’s will; but he could hardly\nhave been brought to declare any ignorance unless he had been arrested\nfor misprision of treason.“I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale,” he said,\nreassuringly. “As a man with public business, I take a snack when I\ncan. I will back this ham,” he added, after swallowing some morsels\nwith alarming haste, “against any ham in the three kingdoms. In my\nopinion it is better than the hams at Freshitt Hall—and I think I am a\ntolerable judge.”“Some don’t like so much sugar in their hams,” said Mrs. Waule. “But my\npoor brother would always have sugar.”"

There is some gratification to a gentleman”—here Mr. Trumbull’s\nvoice conveyed an emotional remonstrance—“in having this kind of ham\nset on his table.”He pushed aside his plate, poured out his glass of ale and drew his\nchair a little forward, profiting by the occasion to look at the inner\nside of his legs, which he stroked approvingly—Mr. Trumbull having all\nthose less frivolous airs and gestures which distinguish the\npredominant races of the north.“You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,” he observed,\nwhen Mary re-entered. “It is by the author of ‘Waverley’: that is Sir\nWalter Scott. I have bought one of his works myself—a very nice thing,\na very superior publication, entitled ‘Ivanhoe.’ You will not get any\nwriter to beat him in a hurry, I think—he will not, in my opinion, be\nspeedily surpassed. I have just been reading a portion at the\ncommencement of ‘Anne of Jeersteen.’ It commences well.” (Things never\nbegan with Mr. Borthrop Trumbull: they always commenced, both in\nprivate life and on his handbills.) “You are a reader, I see. Do you\nsubscribe to our Middlemarch library?”“No,” said Mary. “Mr. Fred Vincy brought this book.”“I am a great bookman myself,” returned Mr. Trumbull. “I have no less\nthan two hundred volumes in calf, and I flatter myself they are well\nselected. Also pictures by Murillo, Rubens, Teniers, Titian, Vandyck,\nand others. I shall be happy to lend you any work you like to mention,\nMiss Garth.”“I am much obliged,” said Mary, hastening away again, “but I have\nlittle time for reading.”“I should say my brother has done something for _her_ in his will,”\nsaid Mr. Solomon, in a very low undertone, when she had shut the door\nbehind her, pointing with his head towards the absent Mary.“His first wife was a poor match for him, though,” said Mrs. Waule.\n“She brought him nothing: and this young woman is only her niece,—and\nvery proud. And my brother has always paid her wage.”"
