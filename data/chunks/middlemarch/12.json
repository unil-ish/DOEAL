  "content": "Dorothea left Ladislaw’s two letters unread on her husband’s\nwriting-table and went to her own place, the scorn and indignation\nwithin her rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away\nany trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean\ncupidity. She did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her\nhusband’s bad temper about these letters: she only knew that they had\ncaused him to offend her. She began to work at once, and her hand did\nnot tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the quotations which had\nbeen given to her the day before, she felt that she was forming her\nletters beautifully, and it seemed to her that she saw the construction\nof the Latin she was copying, and which she was beginning to\nunderstand, more clearly than usual. In her indignation there was a\nsense of superiority, but it went out for the present in firmness of\nstroke, and did not compress itself into an inward articulate voice\npronouncing the once “affable archangel” a poor creature.There had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and Dorothea had\nnot looked away from her own table, when she heard the loud bang of a\nbook on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library\nsteps clinging forward as if he were in some bodily distress. She\nstarted up and bounded towards him in an instant: he was evidently in\ngreat straits for breath. Jumping on a stool she got close to his elbow\nand said with her whole soul melted into tender alarm—“Can you lean on me, dear?”He was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to her,\nunable to speak or move, gasping for breath. When at last he descended\nthe three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had\ndrawn close to the foot of the ladder, he no longer gasped but seemed\nhelpless and about to faint. Dorothea rang the bell violently, and\npresently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch: he did not faint, and\nwas gradually reviving, when Sir James Chettam came in, having been met\nin the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had “had a fit in the\nlibrary.”“Good God! this is just what might have been expected,” was his\nimmediate thought. If his prophetic soul had been urged to\nparticularize, it seemed to him that “fits” would have been the\ndefinite expression alighted upon. He asked his informant, the butler,\nwhether the doctor had been sent for. The butler never knew his master\nto want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a\nphysician?When Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make\nsome signs of his usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction\nfrom her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his side now\nrose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical\nman.“I recommend you to send for Lydgate,” said Sir James. “My mother has\ncalled him in, and she has found him uncommonly clever. She has had a\npoor opinion of the physicians since my father’s death.”"

  "content": "Dorothea appealed to her husband, and he made a silent sign of\napproval. So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he came wonderfully soon, for\nthe messenger, who was Sir James Chettam’s man and knew Mr. Lydgate,\nmet him leading his horse along the Lowick road and giving his arm to\nMiss Vincy.Celia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir\nJames told her of it. After Dorothea’s account, he no longer considered\nthe illness a fit, but still something “of that nature.”“Poor dear Dodo—how dreadful!” said Celia, feeling as much grieved as\nher own perfect happiness would allow. Her little hands were clasped,\nand enclosed by Sir James’s as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx.\n“It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be ill; but I never did\nlike him. And I think he is not half fond enough of Dorothea; and he\nought to be, for I am sure no one else would have had him—do you think\nthey would?”“I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister,” said Sir\nJames.“Yes. But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I think she\nnever will.”“She is a noble creature,” said the loyal-hearted Sir James. He had\njust had a fresh impression of this kind, as he had seen Dorothea\nstretching her tender arm under her husband’s neck and looking at him\nwith unspeakable sorrow. He did not know how much penitence there was\nin the sorrow.“Yes,” said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so,\nbut _he_ would not have been comfortable with Dodo. “Shall I go to her?\nCould I help her, do you think?”“I think it would be well for you just to go and see her before Lydgate\ncomes,” said Sir James, magnanimously. “Only don’t stay long.”"

  "content": "While Celia was gone he walked up and down remembering what he had\noriginally felt about Dorothea’s engagement, and feeling a revival of\nhis disgust at Mr. Brooke’s indifference. If Cadwallader—if every one\nelse had regarded the affair as he, Sir James, had done, the marriage\nmight have been hindered. It was wicked to let a young girl blindly\ndecide her fate in that way, without any effort to save her. Sir James\nhad long ceased to have any regrets on his own account: his heart was\nsatisfied with his engagement to Celia. But he had a chivalrous nature\n(was not the disinterested service of woman among the ideal glories of\nold chivalry?): his disregarded love had not turned to bitterness; its\ndeath had made sweet odors—floating memories that clung with a\nconsecrating effect to Dorothea. He could remain her brotherly friend,\ninterpreting her actions with generous trustfulness.CHAPTER XXX.Qui veut délasser hors de propos, lasse.—PASCAL.Mr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first, and\nin a few days began to recover his usual condition. But Lydgate seemed\nto think the case worth a great deal of attention. He not only used his\nstethoscope (which had not become a matter of course in practice at\nthat time), but sat quietly by his patient and watched him. To Mr.\nCasaubon’s questions about himself, he replied that the source of the\nillness was the common error of intellectual men—a too eager and\nmonotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied with moderate\nwork, and to seek variety of relaxation. Mr. Brooke, who sat by on one\noccasion, suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing, as Cadwallader\ndid, and have a turning-room, make toys, table-legs, and that kind of\nthing.“In short, you recommend me to anticipate the arrival of my second\nchildhood,” said poor Mr. Casaubon, with some bitterness. “These\nthings,” he added, looking at Lydgate, “would be to me such relaxation\nas tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction.”“I confess,” said Lydgate, smiling, “amusement is rather an\nunsatisfactory prescription. It is something like telling people to\nkeep up their spirits. Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit\nto be mildly bored rather than to go on working.”"

  "content": "“Yes, yes,” said Mr. Brooke. “Get Dorothea to play backgammon with you\nin the evenings. And shuttlecock, now—I don’t know a finer game than\nshuttlecock for the daytime. I remember it all the fashion. To be sure,\nyour eyes might not stand that, Casaubon. But you must unbend, you\nknow. Why, you might take to some light study: conchology, now: I\nalways think that must be a light study. Or get Dorothea to read you\nlight things, Smollett—‘Roderick Random,’ ‘Humphrey Clinker:’ they are\na little broad, but she may read anything now she’s married, you know.\nI remember they made me laugh uncommonly—there’s a droll bit about a\npostilion’s breeches. We have no such humor now. I have gone through\nall these things, but they might be rather new to you.”“As new as eating thistles,” would have been an answer to represent Mr.\nCasaubon’s feelings. But he only bowed resignedly, with due respect to\nhis wife’s uncle, and observed that doubtless the works he mentioned\nhad “served as a resource to a certain order of minds.”“You see,” said the able magistrate to Lydgate, when they were outside\nthe door, “Casaubon has been a little narrow: it leaves him rather at a\nloss when you forbid him his particular work, which I believe is\nsomething very deep indeed—in the line of research, you know. I would\nnever give way to that; I was always versatile. But a clergyman is tied\na little tight. If they would make him a bishop, now!—he did a very\ngood pamphlet for Peel. He would have more movement then, more show; he\nmight get a little flesh. But I recommend you to talk to Mrs. Casaubon.\nShe is clever enough for anything, is my niece. Tell her, her husband\nwants liveliness, diversion: put her on amusing tactics.”Without Mr. Brooke’s advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to\nDorothea. She had not been present while her uncle was throwing out his\npleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might be\nenlivened, but she was usually by her husband’s side, and the\nunaffected signs of intense anxiety in her face and voice about\nwhatever touched his mind or health, made a drama which Lydgate was\ninclined to watch. He said to himself that he was only doing right in\ntelling her the truth about her husband’s probable future, but he\ncertainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk\nconfidentially with her. A medical man likes to make psychological\nobservations, and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too\neasily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set\nat nought. Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous\nprediction, and he meant now to be guarded."

  "content": "He asked for Mrs. Casaubon, but being told that she was out walking, he\nwas going away, when Dorothea and Celia appeared, both glowing from\ntheir struggle with the March wind. When Lydgate begged to speak with\nher alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the\nnearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what he might have to\nsay about Mr. Casaubon. It was the first time she had entered this room\nsince her husband had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen not to\nopen the shutters. But there was light enough to read by from the\nnarrow upper panes of the windows.“You will not mind this sombre light,” said Dorothea, standing in the\nmiddle of the room. “Since you forbade books, the library has been out\nof the question. But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope. Is\nhe not making progress?”“Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected. Indeed, he is\nalready nearly in his usual state of health.”“You do not fear that the illness will return?” said Dorothea, whose\nquick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate’s tone.“Such cases are peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon,” said Lydgate.\n“The only point on which I can be confident is that it will be\ndesirable to be very watchful on Mr. Casaubon’s account, lest he should\nin any way strain his nervous power.”“I beseech you to speak quite plainly,” said Dorothea, in an imploring\ntone. “I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I did\nnot know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act\ndifferently.” The words came out like a cry: it was evident that they\nwere the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.“Sit down,” she added, placing herself on the nearest chair, and\nthrowing off her bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of\nformality where a great question of destiny was concerned.“What you say now justifies my own view,” said Lydgate. “I think it is\none’s function as a medical man to hinder regrets of that sort as far\nas possible. But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon’s case is\nprecisely of the kind in which the issue is most difficult to pronounce\nupon. He may possibly live for fifteen years or more, without much\nworse health than he has had hitherto.”Dorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused she said in a\nlow voice, “You mean if we are very careful.”“Yes—careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against\nexcessive application.”“He would be miserable, if he had to give up his work,” said Dorothea,\nwith a quick prevision of that wretchedness."

  "content": "“I am aware of that. The only course is to try by all means, direct and\nindirect, to moderate and vary his occupations. With a happy\nconcurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger\nfrom that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the\ncause of his late attack. On the other hand, it is possible that the\ndisease may develop itself more rapidly: it is one of those cases in\nwhich death is sometimes sudden. Nothing should be neglected which\nmight be affected by such an issue.”There was silence for a few moments, while Dorothea sat as if she had\nbeen turned to marble, though the life within her was so intense that\nher mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of\nscenes and motives.“Help me, pray,” she said, at last, in the same low voice as before.\n“Tell me what I can do.”“What do you think of foreign travel? You have been lately in Rome, I\nthink.”The memories which made this resource utterly hopeless were a new\ncurrent that shook Dorothea out of her pallid immobility.“Oh, that would not do—that would be worse than anything,” she said\nwith a more childlike despondency, while the tears rolled down.\n“Nothing will be of any use that he does not enjoy.”“I wish that I could have spared you this pain,” said Lydgate, deeply\ntouched, yet wondering about her marriage. Women just like Dorothea had\nnot entered into his traditions.“It was right of you to tell me. I thank you for telling me the truth.”“I wish you to understand that I shall not say anything to enlighten\nMr. Casaubon himself. I think it desirable for him to know nothing more\nthan that he must not overwork himself, and must observe certain rules.\nAnxiety of any kind would be precisely the most unfavorable condition\nfor him.”Lydgate rose, and Dorothea mechanically rose at the same time,\nunclasping her cloak and throwing it off as if it stifled her. He was\nbowing and quitting her, when an impulse which if she had been alone\nwould have turned into a prayer, made her say with a sob in her voice—“Oh, you are a wise man, are you not? You know all about life and\ndeath. Advise me. Think what I can do. He has been laboring all his\nlife and looking forward. He minds about nothing else.— And I mind\nabout nothing else—”"

But\nwhat could he say now except that he should see Mr. Casaubon again\nto-morrow?When he was gone, Dorothea’s tears gushed forth, and relieved her\nstifling oppression. Then she dried her eyes, reminded that her\ndistress must not be betrayed to her husband; and looked round the room\nthinking that she must order the servant to attend to it as usual,\nsince Mr. Casaubon might now at any moment wish to enter. On his\nwriting-table there were letters which had lain untouched since the\nmorning when he was taken ill, and among them, as Dorothea well\nremembered, there were young Ladislaw’s letters, the one addressed to\nher still unopened. The associations of these letters had been made the\nmore painful by that sudden attack of illness which she felt that the\nagitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on: it would\nbe time enough to read them when they were again thrust upon her, and\nshe had had no inclination to fetch them from the library. But now it\noccurred to her that they should be put out of her husband’s sight:\nwhatever might have been the sources of his annoyance about them, he\nmust, if possible, not be annoyed again; and she ran her eyes first\nover the letter addressed to him to assure herself whether or not it\nwould be necessary to write in order to hinder the offensive visit."

  "content": "Will wrote from Rome, and began by saying that his obligations to Mr.\nCasaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent. It was\nplain that if he were not grateful, he must be the poorest-spirited\nrascal who had ever found a generous friend. To expand in wordy thanks\nwould be like saying, “I am honest.” But Will had come to perceive that\nhis defects—defects which Mr. Casaubon had himself often pointed\nto—needed for their correction that more strenuous position which his\nrelative’s generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable. He\ntrusted that he should make the best return, if return were possible,\nby showing the effectiveness of the education for which he was\nindebted, and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards\nhimself of funds on which others might have a better claim. He was\ncoming to England, to try his fortune, as many other young men were\nobliged to do whose only capital was in their brains. His friend\nNaumann had desired him to take charge of the “Dispute”—the picture\npainted for Mr. Casaubon, with whose permission, and Mrs. Casaubon’s,\nWill would convey it to Lowick in person. A letter addressed to the\nPoste Restante in Paris within the fortnight would hinder him, if\nnecessary, from arriving at an inconvenient moment. He enclosed a\nletter to Mrs. Casaubon in which he continued a discussion about art,\nbegun with her in Rome.Opening her own letter Dorothea saw that it was a lively continuation\nof his remonstrance with her fanatical sympathy and her want of sturdy\nneutral delight in things as they were—an outpouring of his young\nvivacity which it was impossible to read just now. She had immediately\nto consider what was to be done about the other letter: there was still\ntime perhaps to prevent Will from coming to Lowick. Dorothea ended by\ngiving the letter to her uncle, who was still in the house, and begging\nhim to let Will know that Mr. Casaubon had been ill, and that his\nhealth would not allow the reception of any visitors.No one more ready than Mr. Brooke to write a letter: his only\ndifficulty was to write a short one, and his ideas in this case\nexpanded over the three large pages and the inward foldings. He had\nsimply said to Dorothea—“To be sure, I will write, my dear. He’s a very clever young\nfellow—this young Ladislaw—I dare say will be a rising young man. It’s\na good letter—marks his sense of things, you know. However, I will tell\nhim about Casaubon.”"

  "content": "But the end of Mr. Brooke’s pen was a thinking organ, evolving\nsentences, especially of a benevolent kind, before the rest of his mind\ncould well overtake them. It expressed regrets and proposed remedies,\nwhich, when Mr. Brooke read them, seemed felicitously\nworded—surprisingly the right thing, and determined a sequel which he\nhad never before thought of. In this case, his pen found it such a pity\nyoung Ladislaw should not have come into the neighborhood just at that\ntime, in order that Mr. Brooke might make his acquaintance more fully,\nand that they might go over the long-neglected Italian drawings\ntogether—it also felt such an interest in a young man who was starting\nin life with a stock of ideas—that by the end of the second page it had\npersuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw, since he could not be\nreceived at Lowick, to come to Tipton Grange. Why not? They could find\na great many things to do together, and this was a period of peculiar\ngrowth—the political horizon was expanding, and—in short, Mr. Brooke’s\npen went off into a little speech which it had lately reported for that\nimperfectly edited organ the “Middlemarch Pioneer.” While Mr. Brooke\nwas sealing this letter, he felt elated with an influx of dim\nprojects:—a young man capable of putting ideas into form, the “Pioneer”\npurchased to clear the pathway for a new candidate, documents\nutilized—who knew what might come of it all? Since Celia was going to\nmarry immediately, it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at\ntable with him, at least for a time.But he went away without telling Dorothea what he had put into the\nletter, for she was engaged with her husband, and—in fact, these things\nwere of no importance to her.CHAPTER XXXI.How will you know the pitch of that great bell\nToo large for you to stir? Let but a flute\nPlay ’neath the fine-mixed metal: listen close\nTill the right note flows forth, a silvery rill:\nThen shall the huge bell tremble—then the mass\nWith myriad waves concurrent shall respond\nIn low soft unison.Lydgate that evening spoke to Miss Vincy of Mrs. Casaubon, and laid\nsome emphasis on the strong feeling she appeared to have for that\nformal studious man thirty years older than herself.“Of course she is devoted to her husband,” said Rosamond, implying a\nnotion of necessary sequence which the scientific man regarded as the\nprettiest possible for a woman; but she was thinking at the same time\nthat it was not so very melancholy to be mistress of Lowick Manor with\na husband likely to die soon. “Do you think her very handsome?”“She certainly is handsome, but I have not thought about it,” said\nLydgate.“I suppose it would be unprofessional,” said Rosamond, dimpling. “But\nhow your practice is spreading! You were called in before to the\nChettams, I think; and now, the Casaubons.”“Yes,” said Lydgate, in a tone of compulsory admission. “But I don’t\nreally like attending such people so well as the poor. The cases are\nmore monotonous, and one has to go through more fuss and listen more\ndeferentially to nonsense.”“Not more than in Middlemarch,” said Rosamond. “And at least you go\nthrough wide corridors and have the scent of rose-leaves everywhere.”“That is true, Mademoiselle de Montmorenci,” said Lydgate, just bending\nhis head to the table and lifting with his fourth finger her delicate\nhandkerchief which lay at the mouth of her reticule, as if to enjoy its\nscent, while he looked at her with a smile."

  "content": "But this agreeable holiday freedom with which Lydgate hovered about the\nflower of Middlemarch, could not continue indefinitely. It was not more\npossible to find social isolation in that town than elsewhere, and two\npeople persistently flirting could by no means escape from “the various\nentanglements, weights, blows, clashings, motions, by which things\nseverally go on.” Whatever Miss Vincy did must be remarked, and she was\nperhaps the more conspicuous to admirers and critics because just now\nMrs. Vincy, after some struggle, had gone with Fred to stay a little\nwhile at Stone Court, there being no other way of at once gratifying\nold Featherstone and keeping watch against Mary Garth, who appeared a\nless tolerable daughter-in-law in proportion as Fred’s illness\ndisappeared.Aunt Bulstrode, for example, came a little oftener into Lowick Gate to\nsee Rosamond, now she was alone. For Mrs. Bulstrode had a true sisterly\nfeeling for her brother; always thinking that he might have married\nbetter, but wishing well to the children. Now Mrs. Bulstrode had a\nlong-standing intimacy with Mrs. Plymdale. They had nearly the same\npreferences in silks, patterns for underclothing, china-ware, and\nclergymen; they confided their little troubles of health and household\nmanagement to each other, and various little points of superiority on\nMrs. Bulstrode’s side, namely, more decided seriousness, more\nadmiration for mind, and a house outside the town, sometimes served to\ngive color to their conversation without dividing them—well-meaning\nwomen both, knowing very little of their own motives.Mrs. Bulstrode, paying a morning visit to Mrs. Plymdale, happened to\nsay that she could not stay longer, because she was going to see poor\nRosamond.“Why do you say ‘poor Rosamond’?” said Mrs. Plymdale, a round-eyed\nsharp little woman, like a tamed falcon.“She is so pretty, and has been brought up in such thoughtlessness. The\nmother, you know, had always that levity about her, which makes me\nanxious for the children.”“Well, Harriet, if I am to speak my mind,” said Mrs. Plymdale, with\nemphasis, “I must say, anybody would suppose you and Mr. Bulstrode\nwould be delighted with what has happened, for you have done everything\nto put Mr. Lydgate forward.”“Selina, what do you mean?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in genuine surprise.“Not but what I am truly thankful for Ned’s sake,” said Mrs. Plymdale.\n“He could certainly better afford to keep such a wife than some people\ncan; but I should wish him to look elsewhere. Still a mother has\nanxieties, and some young men would take to a bad life in consequence.\nBesides, if I was obliged to speak, I should say I was not fond of\nstrangers coming into a town.”"

Abraham and\nMoses were strangers in the land, and we are told to entertain\nstrangers. And especially,” she added, after a slight pause, “when they\nare unexceptionable.”“I was not speaking in a religious sense, Harriet. I spoke as a\nmother.”“Selina, I am sure you have never heard me say anything against a niece\nof mine marrying your son.”“Oh, it is pride in Miss Vincy—I am sure it is nothing else,” said Mrs.\nPlymdale, who had never before given all her confidence to “Harriet” on\nthis subject. “No young man in Middlemarch was good enough for her: I\nhave heard her mother say as much. That is not a Christian spirit, I\nthink. But now, from all I hear, she has found a man as proud as\nherself.”“You don’t mean that there is anything between Rosamond and Mr.\nLydgate?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, rather mortified at finding out her own\nignorance.“Is it possible you don’t know, Harriet?”“Oh, I go about so little; and I am not fond of gossip; I really never\nhear any. You see so many people that I don’t see. Your circle is\nrather different from ours.”“Well, but your own niece and Mr. Bulstrode’s great favorite—and yours\ntoo, I am sure, Harriet! I thought, at one time, you meant him for\nKate, when she is a little older.”“I don’t believe there can be anything serious at present,” said Mrs.\nBulstrode. “My brother would certainly have told me.”“Well, people have different ways, but I understand that nobody can see\nMiss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate together without taking them to be engaged.\nHowever, it is not my business. Shall I put up the pattern of mittens?”After this Mrs. Bulstrode drove to her niece with a mind newly\nweighted. She was herself handsomely dressed, but she noticed with a\nlittle more regret than usual that Rosamond, who was just come in and\nmet her in walking-dress, was almost as expensively equipped. Mrs.\nBulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of her brother, and had none\nof her husband’s low-toned pallor. She had a good honest glance and\nused no circumlocution."

Nevertheless, the quilling inside Rosamond’s bonnet was so\ncharming that it was impossible not to desire the same kind of thing\nfor Kate, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes, which were rather fine, rolled\nround that ample quilled circuit, while she spoke.“I have just heard something about you that has surprised me very much,\nRosamond.”“What is that, aunt?” Rosamond’s eyes also were roaming over her aunt’s\nlarge embroidered collar.“I can hardly believe it—that you should be engaged without my knowing\nit—without your father’s telling me.” Here Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes\nfinally rested on Rosamond’s, who blushed deeply, and said—“I am not engaged, aunt.”“How is it that every one says so, then—that it is the town’s talk?”“The town’s talk is of very little consequence, I think,” said\nRosamond, inwardly gratified.“Oh, my dear, be more thoughtful; don’t despise your neighbors so.\nRemember you are turned twenty-two now, and you will have no fortune:\nyour father, I am sure, will not be able to spare you anything. Mr.\nLydgate is very intellectual and clever; I know there is an attraction\nin that. I like talking to such men myself; and your uncle finds him\nvery useful. But the profession is a poor one here. To be sure, this\nlife is not everything; but it is seldom a medical man has true\nreligious views—there is too much pride of intellect. And you are not\nfit to marry a poor man.“Mr. Lydgate is not a poor man, aunt. He has very high connections.”“He told me himself he was poor.”“That is because he is used to people who have a high style of living.”“My dear Rosamond, _you_ must not think of living in high style.”Rosamond looked down and played with her reticule. She was not a fiery\nyoung lady and had no sharp answers, but she meant to live as she\npleased.“Then it is really true?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking very earnestly\nat her niece. “You are thinking of Mr. Lydgate—there is some\nunderstanding between you, though your father doesn’t know. Be open, my\ndear Rosamond: Mr. Lydgate has really made you an offer?”"

She had been quite easy\nas to Lydgate’s feeling and intention, but now when her aunt put this\nquestion she did not like being unable to say Yes. Her pride was hurt,\nbut her habitual control of manner helped her.“Pray excuse me, aunt. I would rather not speak on the subject.”“You would not give your heart to a man without a decided prospect, I\ntrust, my dear. And think of the two excellent offers I know of that\nyou have refused!—and one still within your reach, if you will not\nthrow it away. I knew a very great beauty who married badly at last, by\ndoing so. Mr. Ned Plymdale is a nice young man—some might think\ngood-looking; and an only son; and a large business of that kind is\nbetter than a profession. Not that marrying is everything. I would have\nyou seek first the kingdom of God. But a girl should keep her heart\nwithin her own power.”“I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were. I have already\nrefused him. If I loved, I should love at once and without change,”\nsaid Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and\nplaying the part prettily.“I see how it is, my dear,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy voice,\nrising to go. “You have allowed your affections to be engaged without\nreturn.”“No, indeed, aunt,” said Rosamond, with emphasis.“Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious attachment\nto you?”Rosamond’s cheeks by this time were persistently burning, and she felt\nmuch mortification. She chose to be silent, and her aunt went away all\nthe more convinced."

The result was a\ndecided negative. Mr. Bulstrode, on being cross-questioned, showed that\nLydgate had spoken as no man would who had any attachment that could\nissue in matrimony. Mrs. Bulstrode now felt that she had a serious duty\nbefore her, and she soon managed to arrange a _tête-à-tête_ with\nLydgate, in which she passed from inquiries about Fred Vincy’s health,\nand expressions of her sincere anxiety for her brother’s large family,\nto general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with\nregard to their settlement in life. Young men were often wild and\ndisappointing, making little return for the money spent on them, and a\ngirl was exposed to many circumstances which might interfere with her\nprospects.“Especially when she has great attractions, and her parents see much\ncompany,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “Gentlemen pay her attention, and\nengross her all to themselves, for the mere pleasure of the moment, and\nthat drives off others. I think it is a heavy responsibility, Mr.\nLydgate, to interfere with the prospects of any girl.” Here Mrs.\nBulstrode fixed her eyes on him, with an unmistakable purpose of\nwarning, if not of rebuke.“Clearly,” said Lydgate, looking at her—perhaps even staring a little\nin return. “On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go\nabout with a notion that he must not pay attention to a young lady lest\nshe should fall in love with him, or lest others should think she\nmust.”“Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are. You know that\nour young men here cannot cope with you. Where you frequent a house it\nmay militate very much against a girl’s making a desirable settlement\nin life, and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made.”Lydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the Middlemarch\nOrlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of Mrs. Bulstrode’s\nmeaning. She felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was\nnecessary to do, and that in using the superior word “militate” she had\nthrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still\nevident enough.Lydgate was fuming a little, pushed his hair back with one hand, felt\ncuriously in his waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then stooped to\nbeckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to decline his\nhollow caresses. It would not have been decent to go away, because he\nhad been dining with other guests, and had just taken tea. But Mrs.\nBulstrode, having no doubt that she had been understood, turned the\nconversation."

The\nnext day Mr. Farebrother, parting from Lydgate in the street, supposed\nthat they should meet at Vincy’s in the evening. Lydgate answered\ncurtly, no—he had work to do—he must give up going out in the evening.“What! you are going to get lashed to the mast, eh, and are stopping\nyour ears?” said the Vicar. “Well, if you don’t mean to be won by the\nsirens, you are right to take precautions in time.”A few days before, Lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as\nanything more than the Vicar’s usual way of putting things. They seemed\nnow to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had\nbeen making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood:\nnot, he believed, by Rosamond herself; she, he felt sure, took\neverything as lightly as he intended it. She had an exquisite tact and\ninsight in relation to all points of manners; but the people she lived\namong were blunderers and busybodies. However, the mistake should go no\nfarther. He resolved—and kept his resolution—that he would not go to\nMr. Vincy’s except on business.Rosamond became very unhappy. The uneasiness first stirred by her\naunt’s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had\nnot seen Lydgate, it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly\ncome—into foreboding of that ready, fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes\nout the hopes of mortals. The world would have a new dreariness for\nher, as a wilderness that a magician’s spells had turned for a little\nwhile into a garden. She felt that she was beginning to know the pang\nof disappointed love, and that no other man could be the occasion of\nsuch delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last\nsix months. Poor Rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as\nAriadne—as a charming stage Ariadne left behind with all her boxes full\nof costumes and no hope of a coach."

  "content": "There are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike\ncalled love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an\napology for everything (in literature and the drama). Happily Rosamond\ndid not think of committing any desperate act: she plaited her fair\nhair as beautifully as usual, and kept herself proudly calm. Her most\ncheerful supposition was that her aunt Bulstrode had interfered in some\nway to hinder Lydgate’s visits: everything was better than a\nspontaneous indifference in him. Any one who imagines ten days too\nshort a time—not for falling into leanness, lightness, or other\nmeasurable effects of passion, but—for the whole spiritual circuit of\nalarmed conjecture and disappointment, is ignorant of what can go on in\nthe elegant leisure of a young lady’s mind.On the eleventh day, however, Lydgate when leaving Stone Court was\nrequested by Mrs. Vincy to let her husband know that there was a marked\nchange in Mr. Featherstone’s health, and that she wished him to come to\nStone Court on that day. Now Lydgate might have called at the\nwarehouse, or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket-book\nand left it at the door. Yet these simple devices apparently did not\noccur to him, from which we may conclude that he had no strong\nobjection to calling at the house at an hour when Mr. Vincy was not at\nhome, and leaving the message with Miss Vincy. A man may, from various\nmotives, decline to give his company, but perhaps not even a sage would\nbe gratified that nobody missed him. It would be a graceful, easy way\nof piecing on the new habits to the old, to have a few playful words\nwith Rosamond about his resistance to dissipation, and his firm resolve\nto take long fasts even from sweet sounds. It must be confessed, also,\nthat momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for Mrs.\nBulstrode’s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs\ninto the more substantial web of his thoughts."

  "content": "Miss Vincy was alone, and blushed so deeply when Lydgate came in that\nhe felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any playfulness,\nhe began at once to speak of his reason for calling, and to beg her,\nalmost formally, to deliver the message to her father. Rosamond, who at\nthe first moment felt as if her happiness were returning, was keenly\nhurt by Lydgate’s manner; her blush had departed, and she assented\ncoldly, without adding an unnecessary word, some trivial chain-work\nwhich she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at Lydgate\nhigher than his chin. In all failures, the beginning is certainly the\nhalf of the whole. After sitting two long moments while he moved his\nwhip and could say nothing, Lydgate rose to go, and Rosamond, made\nnervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to\nbetray it, dropped her chain as if startled, and rose too,\nmechanically. Lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain.\nWhen he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair\nlong neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most\nperfect management of self-contented grace. But as he raised his eyes\nnow he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly,\nand made him look at Rosamond with a questioning flash. At this moment\nshe was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old:\nshe felt that her tears had risen, and it was no use to try to do\nanything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let\nthem fall over her cheeks, even as they would.That moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch: it\nshook flirtation into love. Remember that the ambitious man who was\nlooking at those Forget-me-nots under the water was very warm-hearted\nand rash. He did not know where the chain went; an idea had thrilled\nthrough the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in\nraising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed\nsepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould. His words were\nquite abrupt and awkward; but the tone made them sound like an ardent,\nappealing avowal.“What is the matter? you are distressed. Tell me, pray.”Rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before. I am not sure\nthat she knew what the words were: but she looked at Lydgate and the\ntears fell over her cheeks. There could have been no more complete\nanswer than that silence, and Lydgate, forgetting everything else,\ncompletely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief\nthat this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy, actually\nput his arms round her, folding her gently and protectingly—he was used\nto being gentle with the weak and suffering—and kissed each of the two\nlarge tears. This was a strange way of arriving at an understanding,\nbut it was a short way. Rosamond was not angry, but she moved backward\na little in timid happiness, and Lydgate could now sit near her and\nspeak less incompletely. Rosamond had to make her little confession,\nand he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive\nlavishment. In half an hour he left the house an engaged man, whose\nsoul was not his own, but the woman’s to whom he had bound himself."

The felicitous word\n“demise,” which had seasonably occurred to him, had raised his spirits\neven above their usual evening pitch. The right word is always a power,\nand communicates its definiteness to our action. Considered as a\ndemise, old Featherstone’s death assumed a merely legal aspect, so that\nMr. Vincy could tap his snuff-box over it and be jovial, without even\nan intermittent affectation of solemnity; and Mr. Vincy hated both\nsolemnity and affectation. Who was ever awe struck about a testator, or\nsang a hymn on the title to real property? Mr. Vincy was inclined to\ntake a jovial view of all things that evening: he even observed to\nLydgate that Fred had got the family constitution after all, and would\nsoon be as fine a fellow as ever again; and when his approbation of\nRosamond’s engagement was asked for, he gave it with astonishing\nfacility, passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of\nmatrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from the\nwhole the appropriateness of a little more punch.CHAPTER XXXII.They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.\n—SHAKESPEARE: _Tempest_.The triumphant confidence of the Mayor founded on Mr. Featherstone’s\ninsistent demand that Fred and his mother should not leave him, was a\nfeeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the\nold man’s blood-relations, who naturally manifested more their sense of\nthe family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he had become\nbedridden. Naturally: for when “poor Peter” had occupied his arm-chair\nin the wainscoted parlor, no assiduous beetles for whom the cook\nprepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which\nthey had reasons for preferring, than those persons whose Featherstone\nblood was ill-nourished, not from penuriousness on their part, but from\npoverty. Brother Solomon and Sister Jane were rich, and the family\ncandor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were\nalways received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the\nsolemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of\nwealth. Themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to\nbanish from his house, and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should\nhave kept away Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and the rest, who had no\nshadow of such claims. They knew Peter’s maxim, that money was a good\negg, and should be laid in a warm nest."

Probabilities are as various as the faces to\nbe seen at will in fretwork or paper-hangings: every form is there,\nfrom Jupiter to Judy, if you only look with creative inclination. To\nthe poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since Peter had done\nnothing for them in his life, he would remember them at the last. Jonah\nargued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills, while Martha\nsaid that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his\nmoney to those who least expected it. Also it was not to be thought but\nthat an own brother “lying there” with dropsy in his legs must come to\nfeel that blood was thicker than water, and if he didn’t alter his\nwill, he might have money by him. At any rate some blood-relations\nshould be on the premises and on the watch against those who were\nhardly relations at all. Such things had been known as forged wills and\ndisputed wills, which seemed to have the golden-hazy advantage of\nsomehow enabling non-legatees to live out of them. Again, those who\nwere no blood-relations might be caught making away with things—and\npoor Peter “lying there” helpless! Somebody should be on the watch. But\nin this conclusion they were at one with Solomon and Jane; also, some\nnephews, nieces, and cousins, arguing with still greater subtilty as to\nwhat might be done by a man able to “will away” his property and give\nhimself large treats of oddity, felt in a handsome sort of way that\nthere was a family interest to be attended to, and thought of Stone\nCourt as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit.\nSister Martha, otherwise Mrs. Cranch, living with some wheeziness in\nthe Chalky Flats, could not undertake the journey; but her son, as\nbeing poor Peter’s own nephew, could represent her advantageously, and\nwatch lest his uncle Jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable\nthings which seemed likely to happen. In fact there was a general sense\nrunning in the Featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody\nelse, and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the\nAlmighty was watching him."
