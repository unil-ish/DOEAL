  "content": "“I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening. “Thank\nyou, dear, for reminding me. A shilling was it? Can any one give me\nchange for half a crown?”“I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.“Cecil, give me that sovereign. No, give me up that sovereign. I’ll get\nEuphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the\nbeginning.”“Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed\nher across the lawn. Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity. When they\nwere out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite\nbriskly: “Have you told him about him yet?”“No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue\nfor understanding so quickly what her cousin meant. “Let me see—a\nsovereign’s worth of silver.”She escaped into the kitchen. Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were\ntoo uncanny. It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke\nor caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had\nbeen a ruse to surprise the soul.“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.\n“I promised you I shouldn’t. Here is your money—all shillings, except\ntwo half-crowns. Would you count it? You can settle your debt nicely\nnow.”Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St.\nJohn ascending, which had been framed.“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse\nshould come to hear of it from some other source.”“Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle. “George\nEmerson is all right, and what other source is there?”Miss Bartlett considered. “For instance, the driver. I saw him looking\nthrough the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.”Lucy shuddered a little. “We shall get the silly affair on our nerves\nif we aren’t careful. How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold\nof Cecil?”“We must think of every possibility.”“Oh, it’s all right.”“Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows. In fact, he is certain to know.”“I don’t care if he does. I was grateful to you for your letter, but\neven if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at\nit.”"

  "content": "“To contradict it?”“No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not\ntrust him, for he desired her untouched.“Very well, dear, you know best. Perhaps gentlemen are different to\nwhat they were when I was young. Ladies are certainly different.”“Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully. “You kind, anxious\nthing. What _would_ you have me do? First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and\nthen you say, ‘Tell’. Which is it to be? Quick!”Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest. I\nblush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able\nto look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am. You\nwill never forgive me.”“Shall we go out, then. They will smash all the china if we don’t.”For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with\na teaspoon.“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again. Have\nyou seen the young one yet?”“Yes, I have.”“What happened?”“We met at the Rectory.”“What line is he taking up?”“No line. He talked about Italy, like any other person. It is really\nall right. What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it\nbluntly? I do wish I could make you see it my way. He really won’t be\nany nuisance, Charlotte.”“Once a cad, always a cad. That is my poor opinion.”Lucy paused. “Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that\nthere are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She\npaused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.\nThrough the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a\nnovel. It was a new one from Smith’s library. Her mother must have\nreturned from the station.“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett."

  "content": "“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head. I fell into\nall those violets, and he was silly and surprised. I don’t think we\nought to blame him very much. It makes such a difference when you see a\nperson with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly. It really does;\nit makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t\nadmire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. Freddy rather likes him,\nand has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself. He\nhas improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into\ntears. He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big\nrailways—not a porter! and runs down to his father for week-ends. Papa\nwas to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired. There! Now\nfor the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm. “Suppose we\ndon’t talk about this silly Italian business any more. We want you to\nhave a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.”Lucy thought this rather a good speech. The reader may have detected an\nunfortunate slip in it. Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one\ncannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly\npeople. She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the\nentrance of her hostess. Explanations took place, and in the midst of\nthem Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her\nbrain.Chapter XV\nThe Disaster WithinThe Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most\nof the days of that year. In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up\nthe green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of\nmist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the\nheights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves\nunchangeable. Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in\neither arose the tinkle of church bells.The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which\nlay sunning itself upon the gravel path. From the house came incoherent\nsounds, as of females preparing for worship. “The men say they won’t\ngo”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her,\nno nonsense”—“Anne! Mary! Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I\ntrespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she\nat all events was one for church."

  "content": "The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by\nApollo, competent, unswerving, divine. Its rays fell on the ladies\nwhenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down\nat Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan;\non George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete\nthe catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned\npreviously. The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and\nmovement may engender shadow. But this book lies motionless, to be\ncaressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly,\nas though acknowledging the caress.Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window. Her new cerise\ndress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan. At her\nthroat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an\nengagement ring. Her eyes are bent to the Weald. She frowns a\nlittle—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not\nto cry. In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may\nfrown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo\nand the western hills.“Lucy! Lucy! What’s that book? Who’s been taking a book out of the\nshelf and leaving it about to spoil?”“It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.”“But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.”Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a\nLoggia. She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time\nto solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up. It was dreadful\nhow little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like\nthe Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it. Only this morning\nshe had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and\nCecil had said, “What! you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And\nthis too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view\nand the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely\nconceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?”She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a\nSunday fluster.“It’s a special collection—I forget what for. I do beg, no vulgar\nclinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice\nbright sixpence. Where is the child? Minnie! That book’s all warped.\n(Gracious, how plain you look!) Put it under the Atlas to press.\nMinnie!”“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions."

She never brings anything but\nblouses. Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses! Minnie!”Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the\nRector’s niece was taken to church protesting. As usual, she didn’t see\nwhy. Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men? The young\nmen, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words. Mrs.\nHoneychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss\nBartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling\ndown the stairs.“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but\nsovereigns and half crowns. Could any one give me—”“Yes, easily. Jump in. Gracious me, how smart you look! What a lovely\nfrock! You put us all to shame.”“If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear\nthem?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully. She got into the victoria and\nplaced herself with her back to the horse. The necessary roar ensued,\nand then they drove off.“Good-bye! Be good!” called out Cecil.Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering. On the subject of “church\nand so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation. He had\nsaid that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to\noverhaul herself; she did not know it was done. Honest orthodoxy Cecil\nrespected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a\nspiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that\nmight grow heavenward like flowers. All that he said on this subject\npained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the\nEmersons were different.She saw the Emersons after church. There was a line of carriages down\nthe road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie\nVilla. To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father\nand son smoking in the garden.“Introduce me,” said her mother. “Unless the young man considers that\nhe knows me already.”"

Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how\nglad he was that she was going to be married. She said yes, she was\nglad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind\nwith Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic,\nand asked him how he liked his new house.“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;\nshe had never known him offended before. He added: “We find, though,\nthat the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.\nWomen mind such a thing. I am very much upset about it.”“I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch\nuneasily.“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,”\nsaid George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further. “He\nthought we should be artistic. He is disappointed.”“And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to\ngive it up. What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly. She must avoid\ncensuring Cecil. For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned,\nthough his name was never mentioned.“So George says. He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall. Yet\nit does seem so unkind.”“There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George,\nwatching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch. “That’s exactly what I say. Why all\nthis twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?”“There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain\namount of light,” he continued in measured tones. “We cast a shadow on\nsomething wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to\nplace to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place\nwhere you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very\nmuch harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.”“Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!”“Eh—?”“I see you’re going to be clever. I hope you didn’t go behaving like\nthat to poor Freddy.”George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would\nget on rather well.“No, I didn’t,” he said. “He behaved that way to me. It is his\nphilosophy. Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of\nInterrogation first.”"

Do you\nmind tennis on Sunday—?”“George mind tennis on Sunday! George, after his education, distinguish\nbetween Sunday—”“Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday. No more do I. That’s\nsettled. Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so\npleased.”He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter\nabout in these days.She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the\nMiss Alans.”“I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck. The\nkindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came\nout suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the\nmorning sun? She remembered that in all his perversities he had never\nspoken against affection.Miss Bartlett approached.“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.\n“You met her with my daughter in Florence.”“Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of\nthe garden to meet the lady. Miss Bartlett promptly got into the\nvictoria. Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow. It was the pension\nBertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.\nIt was the old, old battle of the room with the view.George did not respond to the bow. Like any boy, he blushed and was\nashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered. He said: “I—I’ll come up\nto tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house. Perhaps\nanything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went\nstraight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as\nclumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and\nneed help. To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the\nweakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at\nFlorence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno."

  "content": "“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for\npeople if his son would talk to them. “George has been in such good\nspirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.”Lucy caught her cousin’s eye. Something in its mute appeal made her\nreckless. “Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then\nshe went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I\nknew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove\naway.Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence\nescapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had\nsighted the ramparts of heaven. Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it\nwith disproportionate joy. All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a\ntune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the\nmelody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things. It was\nnot an exploit. He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her\nhand to her cheek. “He does not love me. No. How terrible if he did!\nBut he has not told. He will not tell.”She longed to shout the words: “It is all right. It’s a secret between\nus two for ever. Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss\nBartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at\nFlorence, when they had knelt packing in his room. The secret, big or\nlittle, was guarded.Only three English people knew of it in the world. Thus she interpreted\nher joy. She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so\nsafe. As he helped her out of the carriage, she said:“The Emersons have been so nice. George Emerson has improved\nenormously.”“How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them,\nand had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy\nCorner for educational purposes.“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth. For the only relationship\nwhich Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. He\nhad no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned."

  "content": "“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are. George Emerson is\ncoming up this afternoon. He is a most interesting man to talk to. Only\ndon’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing\nfor lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to\nher remarks. Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.Lunch was a cheerful meal. Generally Lucy was depressed at meals. Some\none had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not\nvisible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will\nnot last, this cheerfulness. In January you must go to London to\nentertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she\nhad received a guarantee. Her mother would always sit there, her\nbrother here. The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning,\nwould never be hidden behind the western hills. After luncheon they\nasked her to play. She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played\nfrom memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud\napproaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never\ngains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of\nfairyland. Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to\nget restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play\nus the other garden—the one in Parsifal.”She closed the instrument.“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round. There\nGeorge was. He had crept in without interrupting her.“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without\na word of greeting, she reopened the piano. Cecil should have the\nParsifal, and anything else that he liked.“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps\nimplying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson. Lucy did not know\nwhat to do nor even what she wanted to do. She played a few bars of the\nFlower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano. “I vote you\nhave a men’s four.”“All right.”“Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil. “I will not spoil the set.” He\nnever realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to\nmake up a fourth."

I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s\nEmerson.”George corrected him: “I am not bad.”One looked down one’s nose at this. “Then certainly I won’t play,” said\nCecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing\nGeorge, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse. You had much better not\nplay. Much better not.”Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she\nwould play. “I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?”\nBut Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall\nback on Lucy. There is no other way out of it. Lucy, go and change your\nfrock.”Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature. She kept it\nwithout hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in\nthe afternoon. As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was\nsneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything\nup before she married him.Mr. Floyd was her partner. She liked music, but how much better tennis\nseemed. How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit\nat the piano and feel girt under the arms. Once more music appeared to\nher the employment of a child. George served, and surprised her by his\nanxiety to win. She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at\nSanta Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that\nobscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to\nher: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win\nat tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had\nbegun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win."

I saw her the day I arrived at\nSummer Street. It was she who told me that you lived here.”“Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent\ndown to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean\nsomething else. She watched his head, which was almost resting against\nher knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening. “No wonder the\nnovel’s bad,” she added. “I never liked Miss Lavish. But I suppose one\nought to read it as one’s met her.”“All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her\ninattention, and vented his annoyance on literature. “Every one writes\nfor money in these days.”“Oh, Cecil—!”“It is so. I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.”Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow. The ups and\ndowns in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her. She\nhad dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer\nto the clang of his. Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black\nhead again. She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting\nto stroke it; the sensation was curious.“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?”“I never notice much difference in views.”“What do you mean?”“Because they’re all alike. Because all that matters in them is\ndistance and air.”“H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says\nthat there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over\nour heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of\nit.”“I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering\nthe novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation."

Something gets\nadded to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those\nhills.”He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.“What a splendid idea!” she murmured. “I shall enjoy hearing your\nfather talk again.

Why?”“You spoke of ‘us.’”“My mother, I was meaning.”Cecil closed the novel with a bang.“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!”“I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.”“I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day\nand seeing as far as Hindhead. It is the first thing that I remember.”Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after\ntennis—he didn’t do.

I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read\nout loud. If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.”This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him. It put their visitor in\nthe position of a prig. Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.“Mr. Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book. Cecil\nmust have his reading and anything else that he liked. But her\nattention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had\nbeen murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as\nfar as Hindhead.“Am I really to go?” asked George.“No, of course not really,” she answered.“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning. “Find me chapter two, if it isn’t\nbothering you.”Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.She thought she had gone mad.“Here—hand me the book.”"

The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been\nforgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved\npassionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they\nreached the upper lawn alone.Chapter XVI\nLying to GeorgeBut Lucy had developed since the spring. That is to say, she was now\nbetter able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the\nworld disapprove. Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by\ndeep sobs. She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I\nmust write some letters,” and went up to her room. Then she prepared\nfor action. Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our\nhearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we\nshall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must\nstifle it."

It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first\naim was to defeat herself. As her brain clouded over, as the memory of\nthe views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to\nher old shibboleth of nerves. She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering\nwith the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been. Remembering\nthat she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused\nremembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been\nanything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him. The\narmour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man\nnot only from others, but from his own soul. In a few moments Lucy was\nequipped for battle.“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin\narrived. “Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?”Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the\nbook, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at\nheart.“There is a scene in it. The hero and heroine make love. Do you know\nabout that?”“Dear—?”“Do you know about it, please?” she repeated. “They are on a hillside,\nand Florence is in the distance.”“My good Lucia, I am all at sea. I know nothing about it whatever.”“There are violets. I cannot believe it is a coincidence. Charlotte,\nCharlotte, how _could_ you have told her? I have thought before\nspeaking; it _must_ be you.”“Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.“About that dreadful afternoon in February.”Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved. “Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t\nput that in her book?”Lucy nodded.“Not so that one could recognize it. Yes.”“Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.”“So you did tell?”“I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of\nconversation—”"

She has betrayed my confidence.”“Why did you tell her, though? This is a most serious thing.”Why does any one tell anything? The question is eternal, and it was not\nsurprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response. She\nhad done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done\nharm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.Lucy stamped with irritation.“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson;\nit upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again. Behind Cecil’s back.\nUgh! Is it possible that men are such brutes? Behind Cecil’s back as we\nwere walking up the garden.”Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.“What is to be done now? Can you tell me?”“Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day. Fancy if\nyour prospects—”“I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word. “I see now why you wanted me\nto tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that\nyou had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.”It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince. “However,” said the girl,\ndespising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done. You have put me\nin a most awkward position. How am I to get out of it?”Miss Bartlett could not think. The days of her energy were over. She\nwas a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that. She\nstood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the\nnecessary rage.“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.\nAnd who’s to give it him? I can’t tell mother now—owing to you. Nor\nCecil, Charlotte, owing to you. I am caught up every way. I think I\nshall go mad. I have no one to help me. That’s why I’ve sent for you.\nWhat’s wanted is a man with a whip.”Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing. What’s to be _done?_ We women go\nmaundering on. What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?”"

From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a\nbath.”“Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong! We’ve both made a\nmuddle of it. George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he\nto be left unpunished, or isn’t he? I want to know.”Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless. Her own exposure had unnerved\nher, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain. She moved\nfeebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels\namong the laurels.“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.\nCan’t you speak again to him now?”“Willingly would I move heaven and earth—”“I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously. “Will you\nspeak to him? It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all\nhappened because you broke your word.”“Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.”Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.“Yes or no, please; yes or no.”“It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George\nEmerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture. “No one will help me. I\nwill speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was\nwhat her cousin had intended all along.“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below. “Found the lost ball? Good\nman! Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the\nterrace.“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you! I admire you—”They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the\nrubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning\nto cumber her soul. Her anger faded at the sight of him. Ah! The\nEmersons were fine people in their way. She had to subdue a rush in her\nblood before saying:“Freddy has taken him into the dining-room. The others are going down\nthe garden. Come. Let us get this over quickly. Come. I want you in the\nroom, of course.”“Lucy, do you mind doing it?”“How can you ask such a ridiculous question?”"

She remembered their last\nevening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss\nBartlett’s toque on the door. She was not to be trapped by pathos a\nsecond time. Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying. “The jam’s jolly good.”George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the\ndining-room. As she entered he stopped, and said:“No—nothing to eat.”“You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr.\nEmerson all he wants. Where’s mother?”“She’s started on her Sunday writing. She’s in the drawing-room.”“That’s all right. You go away.”He went off singing.Lucy sat down at the table. Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly\nfrightened, took up a book and pretended to read.She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech. She just said: “I\ncan’t have it, Mr. Emerson. I cannot even talk to you. Go out of this\nhouse, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing\nas she spoke and pointing to the door. “I hate a row. Go please.”“What—”“No discussion.”“But I can’t—”She shook her head. “Go, please. I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.”“You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t\nmean that you are going to marry that man?”The line was unexpected.She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her. “You are\nmerely ridiculous,” she said quietly.Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse. He’s\nonly for an acquaintance. He is for society and cultivated talk. He\nshould know no one intimately, least of all a woman.”It was a new light on Cecil’s character.“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?”“I can scarcely discuss—”"

He is the sort who are all right so long as\nthey keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.\nThat’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now. It’s\nshocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny\nhimself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a\ndifferent person. I would never have let myself go. But I saw him first\nin the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced\nthe names of great painters. Then he brings us here, and we find it is\nto play some silly trick on a kind neighbour. That is the man all\nover—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he\ncan find. Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and\nteaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to\nsettle whether you were shocked or no. Cecil all over again. He daren’t\nlet a woman decide. He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand\nyears. Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s\ncharming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly;\nand you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.\nSo it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the\nwhole of this afternoon. Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’\nbecause the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more\nself-control. I’m not ashamed. I don’t apologize. But it has frightened\nyou, and you may not have noticed that I love you. Or would you have\ntold me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? But\ntherefore—therefore I settled to fight him.”Lucy thought of a very good remark.“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson. Pardon me for\nsuggesting that you have caught the habit.”And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality. He\nsaid:“Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary. “I’m the same kind\nof brute at bottom. This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep,\nand men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the\ngarden. But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He\nthought. “Yes—really in a better way. I want you to have your own\nthoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards\nher. “Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as\nyou came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain. I\nhave cared for you since that man died. I cannot live without you, ‘No\ngood,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again\nwhen all the world is glorious water and sun. As you came through the\nwood I saw that nothing else mattered. I called. I wanted to live and\nhave my chance of joy.”“And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm. “Does he not\nmatter? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly? A detail of no\nimportance, I suppose?”But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?”He said: “It is our last chance. I shall do all that I can.” And as if\nhe had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some\nportent against the skies of the evening. “You wouldn’t stop us this\nsecond time if you understood,” he said. “I have been into the dark,\nand I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.”Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though\ndemolishing some invisible obstacle.

It is that love and youth matter intellectually.”In silence the two women watched him. His last remark, they knew, was\nnonsense, but was he going after it or not? Would not he, the cad, the\ncharlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish? No. He was apparently\ncontent. He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they\nlooked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin\nto climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house. Their tongues\nwere loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!”Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet. “Well, he amuses me,” she said.\n“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the\nlatter. One more fuss through with you, Charlotte. Many thanks. I\nthink, though, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me\nagain.”And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish:“Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is\nit? Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really. It might have been very serious.\nBut you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.”“Let’s go down to them.”But, once in the open air, she paused. Some emotion—pity, terror, love,\nbut the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.\nSummer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the\nmore pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring. That something\nor other mattered intellectually? A leaf, violently agitated, danced\npast her, while other leaves lay motionless. That the earth was\nhastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over\nWindy Corner?“Hullo, Lucy! There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll\nhurry.”“Mr. Emerson has had to go.”“What a nuisance! That spoils the four. I say, Cecil, do play, do,\nthere’s a good chap.

He was not even angry, but\nstood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what\nhad led her to such a conclusion.She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their\nbourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men. Freddy and Mr.\nFloyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably\nlingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things\nover. We are too different. I must ask you to release me, and try to\nforget that there ever was such a foolish girl.”It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her\nvoice showed it.“Different—how—how—”“I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued,\nstill on her knees by the sideboard. “My Italian trip came too late,\nand I am forgetting all that I learnt there. I shall never be able to\ntalk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.”“I don’t understand you. You aren’t like yourself. You’re tired, Lucy.”“Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once. “That is exactly like you. You\nalways think women don’t mean what they say.”“Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.”“What if I do? It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth. I can’t\nmarry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.”“You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed\nindignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches. But give me a\nmoment’s time.” He closed his eyes. “You must excuse me if I say stupid\nthings, but my brain has gone to pieces.

To bring on\nthe crisis, she said:“There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them. Things\nmust come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.\nIf you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to\nyou—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.”“I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never\ncould play. I don’t understand a word you say.”“You can play well enough to make up a four. I thought it abominably\nselfish of you.”“No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis. Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you\nhave warned me if you felt anything wrong? You talked of our wedding at\nlunch—at least, you let me talk.”“I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly. “I might\nhave known there would have been these dreadful explanations. Of\ncourse, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have\nbeen feeling for weeks. Surely it was better not to speak until I felt\ncertain.” She developed this position. “Often before I have wondered if\nI was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted\nto be my husband? I don’t think so. You don’t like Freddy, nor my\nmother. There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all\nour relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good\nmentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point. They have\nto-day. I see clearly. I must speak. That’s all.”“I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently. “I cannot tell why,\nbut though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not\ntreating me fairly. It’s all too horrible.”“What’s the good of a scene?”“No good. But surely I have a right to hear a little more.”He put down his glass and opened the window.

He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first\ntime since they were engaged. From a Leonardo she had become a living\nwoman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even\neluded art. His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of\ngenuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved\nme!”“I did not,” she said. “I thought I did at first. I am sorry, and ought\nto have refused you this last time, too.”He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed\nat his dignified behaviour. She had counted on his being petty. It\nwould have made things easier for her. By a cruel irony she was drawing\nout all that was finest in his disposition.“You don’t love me, evidently.
