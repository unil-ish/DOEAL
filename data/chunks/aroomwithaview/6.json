  "content": "“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the\nfloor and preparing to go. “It is being certain that Lucy cares for me\nreally. It is that love and youth matter intellectually.”In silence the two women watched him. His last remark, they knew, was\nnonsense, but was he going after it or not? Would not he, the cad, the\ncharlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish? No. He was apparently\ncontent. He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they\nlooked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin\nto climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house. Their tongues\nwere loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!”Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet. “Well, he amuses me,” she said.\n“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the\nlatter. One more fuss through with you, Charlotte. Many thanks. I\nthink, though, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me\nagain.”And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish:“Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is\nit? Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really. It might have been very serious.\nBut you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.”“Let’s go down to them.”But, once in the open air, she paused. Some emotion—pity, terror, love,\nbut the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.\nSummer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the\nmore pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring. That something\nor other mattered intellectually? A leaf, violently agitated, danced\npast her, while other leaves lay motionless. That the earth was\nhastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over\nWindy Corner?“Hullo, Lucy! There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll\nhurry.”“Mr. Emerson has had to go.”“What a nuisance! That spoils the four. I say, Cecil, do play, do,\nthere’s a good chap. It’s Floyd’s last day. Do play tennis with us,\njust this once.”"

As you well\nremarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for\nanything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not\ninflict myself on you.”The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes. How had she stood Cecil for a moment?\nHe was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her\nengagement.Chapter XVII\nLying to CecilHe was bewildered. He had nothing to say. He was not even angry, but\nstood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what\nhad led her to such a conclusion.She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their\nbourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men. Freddy and Mr.\nFloyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably\nlingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things\nover. We are too different. I must ask you to release me, and try to\nforget that there ever was such a foolish girl.”It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her\nvoice showed it.“Different—how—how—”“I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued,\nstill on her knees by the sideboard. “My Italian trip came too late,\nand I am forgetting all that I learnt there. I shall never be able to\ntalk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.”“I don’t understand you. You aren’t like yourself. You’re tired, Lucy.”“Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once. “That is exactly like you. You\nalways think women don’t mean what they say.”“Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.”“What if I do? It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth. I can’t\nmarry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.”“You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed\nindignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches. But give me a\nmoment’s time.” He closed his eyes. “You must excuse me if I say stupid\nthings, but my brain has gone to pieces. Part of it lives three minutes\nback, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it\ndifficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.”"

  "content": "It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation\nincreased. She again desired a struggle, not a discussion. To bring on\nthe crisis, she said:“There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them. Things\nmust come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.\nIf you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to\nyou—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.”“I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never\ncould play. I don’t understand a word you say.”“You can play well enough to make up a four. I thought it abominably\nselfish of you.”“No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis. Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you\nhave warned me if you felt anything wrong? You talked of our wedding at\nlunch—at least, you let me talk.”“I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly. “I might\nhave known there would have been these dreadful explanations. Of\ncourse, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have\nbeen feeling for weeks. Surely it was better not to speak until I felt\ncertain.” She developed this position. “Often before I have wondered if\nI was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted\nto be my husband? I don’t think so. You don’t like Freddy, nor my\nmother. There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all\nour relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good\nmentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point. They have\nto-day. I see clearly. I must speak. That’s all.”“I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently. “I cannot tell why,\nbut though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not\ntreating me fairly. It’s all too horrible.”“What’s the good of a scene?”“No good. But surely I have a right to hear a little more.”He put down his glass and opened the window. From where she knelt,\njangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into\nit, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful\nface."

I shall only say things that will make me\nunhappy afterwards. As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no\ngood talking.”But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment\nmore desirable. He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first\ntime since they were engaged. From a Leonardo she had become a living\nwoman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even\neluded art. His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of\ngenuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved\nme!”“I did not,” she said. “I thought I did at first. I am sorry, and ought\nto have refused you this last time, too.”He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed\nat his dignified behaviour. She had counted on his being petty. It\nwould have made things easier for her. By a cruel irony she was drawing\nout all that was finest in his disposition.“You don’t love me, evidently. I dare say you are right not to. But it\nwould hurt a little less if I knew why.”“Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort\nwho can’t know any one intimately.”A horrified look came into his eyes."

When we\nwere only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always\nprotecting me.” Her voice swelled. “I won’t be protected. I will choose\nfor myself what is ladylike and right. To shield me is an insult. Can’t\nI be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through\nyou? A woman’s place! You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s\nconventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to\nher feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand\nbeautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap\nyourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me. I\nwon’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more\nglorious, and you hide them from me. That’s why I break off my\nengagement. You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when\nyou came to people—” She stopped.There was a pause. Then Cecil said with great emotion:“It is true.”“True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.“True, every word. It is a revelation. It is—I.”“Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.”He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true. I\nfell to pieces the very first day we were engaged. I behaved like a cad\nto Beebe and to your brother. You are even greater than I thought.” She\nwithdrew a step. “I’m not going to worry you. You are far too good to\nme. I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for\nthis: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you\nwouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve. I have\nnever known you till this evening. I have just used you as a peg for my\nsilly notions of what a woman should be. But this evening you are a\ndifferent person: new thoughts—even a new voice—”“What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with\nincontrollable anger.“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.Then she lost her balance. She cried: “If you think I am in love with\nsome one else, you are very much mistaken.”“Of course I don’t think that. You are not that kind, Lucy.”“Oh, yes, you do think it. It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept\nEurope back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men. If a\ngirl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone\nelse in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting,\nbrutal! As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.”He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past. I shall\nnever say it again. You have taught me better.”She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again."

I only meant that there was a\nforce in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.”“All right, Cecil, that will do. Don’t apologize to me. It was my\nmistake.”“It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals,\nand yours are the nobler. I was bound up in the old vicious notions,\nand all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke. “I must\nactually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really\nam. Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman. Will you shake\nhands?”“Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the\ncurtains. “Good-night, Cecil. Good-bye. That’s all right. I’m sorry\nabout it. Thank you very much for your gentleness.”“Let me light your candle, shall I?”They went into the hall.“Thank you. Good-night again. God bless you, Lucy!”“Good-bye, Cecil.”She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters\npassed over her face like the beat of wings. On the landing he paused\nstrong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.\nFor all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his\nlove became him like the leaving of it.She could never marry. In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.\nCecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself. She must\nbe one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for\nliberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that\nGeorge had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable\nrelease, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.She put out the lamp."

She gave\nup trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the\nbenighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to\ntheir destiny by catch-words. The armies are full of pleasant and pious\nfolk. But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy\nwithin. They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be\ntheir strife after virtue. As the years pass, they are censured. Their\npleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism,\ntheir unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort\nwherever they go. They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas\nAthene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary\ncourse of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not\nlove him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one. The night\nreceived her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.Chapter XVIII\nLying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The ServantsWindy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred\nfeet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great\nbuttresses that supported the hill. On either side of it was a shallow\nravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the\nleft ran the highway into the Weald.Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble\ndispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy\nCorner,—he laughed. The situation was so glorious, the house so\ncommonplace, not to say impertinent. The late Mr. Honeychurch had\naffected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his\nmoney, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret,\nshaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and\nwatch the carts going up and down the road. So impertinent—and yet the\nhouse “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings\nhonestly. Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive\narchitects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all\nthese suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner\nseemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation. One might\nlaugh at the house, but one never shuddered. Mr. Beebe was bicycling\nover this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip. He had heard from\nthe Miss Alans. These admirable ladies, since they could not go to\nCissie Villa, had changed their plans. They were going to Greece\ninstead."

Of course,\nAthens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive\nbread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting\nfirst into a steamer and then into a train. But is there an English\nChurch?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go\nany further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable\npension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.”Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe\ngreeted Windy Corner was partly for her. She would see the fun of it,\nand some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty. Though she was\nhopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that\ncerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or\nshe could not play the piano as she did. He had a theory that musicians\nare incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they\nwant and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their\nfriends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet\nbeen understood. This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been\nillustrated by facts. Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only\nriding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether\nMiss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies\nto visit Athens.A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught\nsight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped\nabruptly when it reached the main road. Therefore it must be the horse,\nwho always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.\nThe door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe\nrecognized as Cecil and Freddy. They were an odd couple to go driving;\nbut he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs. Cecil, who wore a\nbowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the\nstation. They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the\nsummit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away."

Most certainly they will go to Constantinople. They are taken\nin a snare that cannot fail. They will end by going round the world.”Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused\nand interested.“Isn’t Romance capricious! I never notice it in you young people; you\ndo nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while\nthe Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against\nthe terrible thing. ‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’\nSo they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension\nwith magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland\nforlorn! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans. They want the\nPension Keats.”“I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you\nany matches?”“I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he\nspoke to the boy more kindly.“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?”“Never.”“Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit. I haven’t been to\nGreece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my\nfriends going. It is altogether too big for our little lot. Don’t you\nthink so? Italy is just about as much as we can manage. Italy is\nheroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in\neither case absolutely out of our suburban focus. All right, Freddy—I\nam not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another\nfellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a\ncigarette, and went on talking to the two young men. “I was saying, if\nour poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be\nItalian. Big enough in all conscience. The ceiling of the Sistine\nChapel for me. There the contrast is just as much as I can realize. But\nnot the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here\ncomes the victoria.”"

And before they had gone a\ndozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box,\nwhich had not been returned. As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you\nonly talked about books. Cecil’s hard hit. Lucy won’t marry him. If\nyou’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken\ndown.”“But when—”“Late last night. I must go.”“Perhaps they won’t want me down there.”“No—go on. Good-bye.”“Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle\nof his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.\nOh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he\nnegotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart. The house was\nagain as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata. He hesitated\na moment, but went down the garden as requested. There he found a\nmournful company. It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and\nbroken the dahlias. Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them\nup, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of\nassistance. At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a\nminute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe? Gracious what a mess everything is! Look\nat my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the\nground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage\nhaving to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give\neveryone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.”Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though\nconveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn\ngales.“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. The garden-child, who\ndid not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.\nMinnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very\ndisagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings\nwould tear longways instead of across.“Come for a walk with me,” he told her. “You have worried them as much\nas they can stand. Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly. I\nshall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.”"

Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when\nboth my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange\ncactus will go before I can get to it.”Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss\nBartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about\nfor, either in the house or out of it.”Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she\nhad exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round\nand exasperated Minnie by an acceptance. As they walked up the garden,\nthe orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the\ngarden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth\nof blossom.“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a\nmoment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother. Or will\nshe come with us?”“I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.”“They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for\nbreakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has\ngone, and Freddy won’t play with me. In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house\nis not _at all_ what it was yesterday.”“Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur. “Go and put on your boots.”He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively\npursuing the Sonatas of Mozart. She stopped when he entered.“How do you do? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at\nthe Beehive. Would you come too?”“I don’t think I will, thank you.”“No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.”Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom\nof his heart, he thought them silly little things.Lucy passed into Schumann.“Miss Honeychurch!”“Yes.”“I met them on the hill. Your brother told me.”“Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed. Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had\nthought that she would like him to be told.“I needn’t say that it will go no further.”"

Mother minds dreadfully.”“I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as\nmuch as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. It was really\na ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not\nherself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.“And Freddy minds.”“Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he? I gathered that\nhe disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.”“Boys are so odd.”Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor. Tea\nat the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel. Mr.\nBeebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action,\nso after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an\nabsurd letter from Miss Alan. That was really what brought me over. I\nthought it might amuse you all.”“How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter. After\na few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with\n“Going abroad? When do they start?”“Next week, I gather.”“Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?”“No, he didn’t.”“Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.”So she did want to talk about her broken engagement. Always\ncomplaisant, he put the letter away. But she, at once exclaimed in a\nhigh voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!

He saw, to his\nsurprise, that she was apparently serious.“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends,\nafter Cissie Villa.”“Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would\ngive anything to go with them.”“Would your mother spare you again so soon? You have scarcely been home\nthree months.”“She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement. “I simply\n_must_ go away. I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through\nher hair. “Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away? I didn’t realize at\nthe time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.”“You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—”“Yes, yes. I knew you’d understand.”Mr. Beebe did not quite understand. Why could not Miss Honeychurch\nrepose in the bosom of her family? Cecil had evidently taken up the\ndignified line, and was not going to annoy her. Then it struck him that\nher family itself might be annoying. He hinted this to her, and she\naccepted the hint eagerly.“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the\nidea and everything has calmed down.”“I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.“No, not at all. Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you\nthe whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so\nmasterful. I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way. He would\nimprove me in places where I can’t be improved. Cecil won’t let a woman\ndecide for herself—in fact, he daren’t. What nonsense I do talk! But\nthat is the kind of thing.”"

I agree so much that you must let me make one little\ncriticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?”“But I must go somewhere!” she cried. “I have been worrying all the\nmorning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with\nclenched fists, and repeated: “I must! And the time I shall have with\nmother, and all the money she spent on me last spring. You all think\nmuch too highly of me. I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss\nBartlett entered, and her nervousness increased. “I must get away, ever\nso far. I must know my own mind and where I want to go.”“Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out\nof the front-door. He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.\nWhen he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the\ntinkling of a Mozart Sonata.“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.“One is very thankful that she has such a resource. She is evidently\nmuch worried, as, of course, she ought to be. I know all about it. The\nmarriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she\ncould wind herself up to speak.”Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.\nHe had never fathomed Miss Bartlett. As he had put it to himself at\nFlorence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of\nmeaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable. He\nassumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with\nher. Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter\ndrop.”“I wonder.”“It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in\nSummer Street. It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal\nat the present moment.”Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows. Death is a strong word—surely too\nstrong. There was no question of tragedy. He said: “Of course, Miss\nHoneychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she\nchooses. Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.”"

A rector lives in a\nweb of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is\nthe less he will regard them. He will change the subject, as did Mr.\nBeebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people\nlately? I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish. It is odd how we of\nthat pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been\nworking into one another’s lives. Two, three, four, six of us—no,\neight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch. We\nmust really give the Signora a testimonial.”And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in\na silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern. On the\nsummit they paused. The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last\nhour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.\nGrey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and\nshredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there\ngleamed a hint of the disappearing blue. Summer was retreating. The\nwind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for\nthose vast operations in heaven. The weather was breaking up, breaking,\nbroken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural\nthat equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery. Mr.\nBeebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.\nNo smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said:\n“We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.\nThe darkness last night was appalling.”"

That amiable\nhostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do\ndearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant\nsanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably. Mr. Beebe saw that\nMiss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be\ndull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces. They would\nhand the child her food through the window. Thus he was incidentally\nenabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very\nmuch object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.\n“Nothing about the past. I know little and care less about that; I am\nabsolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit. She has acted\nloftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we\nthink too highly of her. But the future. Seriously, what do you think\nof this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again. “I don’t know\nwhether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their\nmad career. It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.”Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to\nhesitate, and then read it again.“I can’t see the point of it myself.”To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you. In it\nI spy Lucy’s salvation.”“Really. Now, why?”“She wanted to leave Windy Corner.”“I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to\nsay—selfish.”“It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire\na change.”Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect\nmisses. Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another\nlady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced. Perhaps\nshe must have a change. I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand\nthese things. But why need she go as far as Greece?”“You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently\ninterested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner. “Why Greece?\n(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?) Why not Tunbridge Wells? Oh, Mr. Beebe!\nI had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this\nmorning. I cannot help her. I will say no more. Perhaps I have already\nsaid too much. I am not to talk. I wanted her to spend six months with\nme at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.”Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife."

Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did\nnot desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another\nman” that would have attracted a grosser mind. He only felt that Miss\nBartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be\ndelivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form. Its\nvery vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry. His belief in\ncelibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and\nculture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate\nflower. “They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So\nran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off\nbut with a slight feeling of pleasure. In the case of Lucy, the feeling\nwas intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go\nfurther—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her\nresolution of virginity. The feeling was very subtle and quite\nundogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in\nthis entanglement. Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action\nsubsequently, and his influence on the action of others. The compact\nthat he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only\nLucy, but religion also.They hurried home through a world of black and grey. He conversed on\nindifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants;\nItalian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could\nliterature influence life? Windy Corner glimmered. In the garden, Mrs.\nHoneychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her\nflowers.“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly. “This comes of putting off. We\nmight have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to\ngo to Greece. I don’t know what the world’s coming to.”“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must. Come up to the\nhouse and let’s talk it over. Do you, in the first place, mind her\nbreaking with Vyse?”“Mr. Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.”“So am I,” said Freddy.“Good. Now come up to the house.”They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone. It was expensive\nand dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed. Nor would\nCharlotte have succeeded. The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.\nBy his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a\nclergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he\nbent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she\nsaid; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right. It must be something I\ncan’t understand. Lucy! Let’s tell her. Lucy!”“She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said. He opened the door, and\nheard the words of a song:“Look not thou on beauty’s charming.”“I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.”“Sit thou still when kings are arming,\nTaste not when the wine-cup glistens——”“It’s a song that Cecil gave her. How odd girls are!”“What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly. She went into the\ndrawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I\nwas so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.”"

Oh, thank you!”Mr. Beebe followed. Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the\nkeys. She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. Her mother\nbent over her. Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the\nfloor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.\nOddly enough, the group was beautiful. Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of\nthe past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_,\nin which people who care for one another are painted chatting together\nabout noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and\ntherefore ignored by the art of to-day. Why should Lucy want either to\nmarry or to travel when she had such friends at home?“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,\nSpeak not when the people listens,”she continued.“Here’s Mr. Beebe.”“Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways.”“It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he. “Go on.”“It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly. “I forget why—harmony or\nsomething.”“I suspected it was unscholarly. It’s so beautiful.”“The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten. Why\nthrow up the sponge?”“How stupidly you talk!” said his sister. The _Santa Conversazione_ was\nbroken up. After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about\nGreece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual\nfelicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.”“Stop thine ear against the singer—”“Wait a minute; she is finishing.”“From the red gold keep thy finger;\nVacant heart and hand and eye\nEasy live and quiet die.”“I love weather like this,” said Freddy.Mr. Beebe passed into it."

He half\nfancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the\nshout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing\nthe words that it adorned:“Vacant heart and hand and eye\nEasy live and quiet die.”However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a\nbeacon in the roaring tides of darkness.Chapter XIX\nLying to Mr. EmersonThe Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near\nBloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial\nEngland. They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and\nfor a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books,\nmackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.\nThat there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them,\nfor they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken\nby those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores. Miss\nHoneychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.\nQuinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help\ntowards freshening up one’s face in the train. Lucy promised, a little\ndepressed.“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse\nto help you. A gentleman is such a stand-by.”Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to\ndrum nervously upon her card-case.“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine\ncontinued. “It is not every young man who would be so unselfish. But\nperhaps he will come out and join you later on.”“Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute\nand less kindly of the two sisters.“However, we shall see him when he sees you off. I do so long to see\nhim.”“No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch. “She doesn’t\nlike it.”“No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.“Really? How funny!

There all the time we had to sit fencing,\nand almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is\nmost unpleasant.”Lucy had plenty to say in reply. She described the Miss Alans’\ncharacter: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would\nbe everywhere in no time.“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?”“Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.\nI shall tell them then. It’s much pleasanter. How wet it is! Let’s turn\nin here.”“Here” was the British Museum. Mrs. Honeychurch refused. If they must\ntake shelter, let it be in a shop. Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was\non the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a\nmythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses\nand gods.“Oh, well, let it be shop, then. Let’s go to Mudie’s. I’ll buy a\nguide-book.”“You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so\nstupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this\nhole-and-corner work. You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m\nthankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute. But why not\nannounce it? Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?”“It’s only for a few days.”“But why at all?”Lucy was silent. She was drifting away from her mother. It was quite\neasy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he\nhears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the\nincidental advantage of being true. But she could not say it. She\ndisliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that\nking of terrors—Light. Ever since that last evening at Florence she had\ndeemed it unwise to reveal her soul."

Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she\ncan leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained\nunspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.”This was perfectly true. Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when\nshe escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no\nlonger. It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought\nstraight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain. She\ndid not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself\nmust assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very\ninstruments of life. She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off\nmy engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece\nbecause I do not love George; it is more important that I should look\nup gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone\nelse is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and\nanxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she\nproceeded with the conversation.“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk! Of course I’m not tired of Windy\nCorner.”“Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?”She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.”“Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?”“Hush, mother! People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s. She\nbought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home;\nbut as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to\nbe away in the future more than I have been. You see, I come into my\nmoney next year.”Tears came into her mother’s eyes.Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed\n“eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear. “I’ve seen\nthe world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy. I have seen so\nlittle of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket\nlike to-day, but to stop. I might even share a flat for a little with\nsome other girl.”"
