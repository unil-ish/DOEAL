  "content": "So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to\nirritation. He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of\nsaying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to\nsubstitute for it the society he called broad. He did not realize that\nLucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities\nthat create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its\ndefects, her heart refused to despise it entirely. Nor did he realize a\nmore important point—that if she was too great for this society, she\nwas too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal\nintercourse would alone satisfy her. A rebel she was, but not of the\nkind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but\nequality beside the man she loved. For Italy was offering her the most\npriceless of all possessions—her own soul.Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged\nthirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in\nstriking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net\nand immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.\nThe sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of\nmind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing\nwhat they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.”“But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe. “I wrote to Miss\nTeresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called,\nand my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably. They\nare coming. I heard from them this morning.“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried. “Just because\nthey’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their\n‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing. And poor Lucy—serve her\nright—worn to a shadow.”Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the\ntennis-court. Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he\nwas there.“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a\ntennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. When in motion his orb was\nencircled by a ring. “If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move\nin before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about\nwhitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the\nfair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count. I told you not Saturn.”“Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.\n“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.”“Saturn doesn’t bounce.”“Saturn bounces enough.”“No, he doesn’t.”“Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.”“Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch."

That’s right,\nMinnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over\nthe shins!”Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria\nCorombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to\nfury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a\nwell-mannered child into a howling wilderness. Up in the house Cecil\nheard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not\ncome down to impart it, in case he got hurt. He was not a coward and\nbore necessary pain as well as any man. But he hated the physical\nviolence of the young. How right it was! Sure enough it ended in a cry.“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as\nLucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her\nfeet by her brother.“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.“They have taken Cissie Villa.”“That wasn’t the name—”Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the\ngrass. An interval elapses.“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.”“Nonsense, Freddy! You know nothing about it.”“Nonsense yourself! I’ve this minute seen him. He said to me: ‘Ahem!\nHoneychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem! ahem! I have at\nlast procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’\nand slapped him on the back.”“Exactly. The Miss Alans?”“Rather not. More like Anderson.”“Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs.\nHoneychurch exclaimed. “Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right? I _said_\ndon’t interfere with Cissie Villa. I’m always right. I’m quite uneasy\nat being always right so often.”“It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s. Freddy doesn’t even know the\nname of the people he pretends have taken it instead.”“Yes, I do. I’ve got it. Emerson.”“What name?”“Emerson. I’ll bet you anything you like.”"

  "content": "“What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly. “I wish I had\nnever bothered over it at all.”Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. Mr. Beebe,\nwhose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was\nthe proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch\nfrom the contemplation of her own abilities.“Emerson, Freddy? Do you know what Emersons they are?”“I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was\ndemocratic. Like his sister and like most young people, he was\nnaturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact\nthat there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.“I trust they are the right sort of person. All right, Lucy”—she was\nsitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your\nmother’s a snob. But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s\naffectation to pretend there isn’t.”“Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.She was gazing sideways. Seated on a promontory herself, she could see\nthe pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the\nWeald. The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this\nlateral view.“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no\nrelations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. Pray, does\nthat satisfy you?”“Oh, yes,” he grumbled. “And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re\nfriends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country\nfamilies will be able to call in perfect safety.”“_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly. “Lucy, don’t screech.\nIt’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.”“But has Cecil—”“Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.\nAhem! Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’”She got up from the grass."

  "content": "It was hard on Lucy. Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much. While\nshe believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry\nOtway, she had borne it like a good girl. She might well “screech” when\nshe heard that it came partly from her lover. Mr. Vyse was a\ntease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in\nthwarting people. The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss\nHoneychurch with more than his usual kindness.When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the\nsame ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was\nstrange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation\nwhile she recovered her composure. He diverted it as follows:“The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean? No, I don’t suppose it\nwill prove to be them. It is probably a long cry from them to friends\nof Mr. Vyse’s. Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people! The queerest\npeople! For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.\n“There was a great scene over some violets. They picked violets and\nfilled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have\nfailed to come to Cissie Villa. Poor little ladies! So shocked and so\npleased. It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories. ‘My dear\nsister loves flowers,’ it began. They found the whole room a mass of\nblue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet\nso beautiful.’ It is all very difficult. Yes, I always connect those\nFlorentine Emersons with violets.”“Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his\nsister’s face was very red. She could not recover herself. Mr. Beebe\nsaw it, and continued to divert the conversation.“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a\ngoodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very\nimmature—pessimism, et cetera. Our special joy was the father—such a\nsentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.”In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip,\nbut he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble. He repeated\nany rubbish that came into his head."

  "content": "“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “Lucy, don’t desert us—go\non playing bumble-puppy. Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been\nthe oddest place. That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being\nthere. Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop? By-the-by, we really must\nask Charlotte here some time.”Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer. He suggested that his\nhostess was mistaken. At the hint of opposition she warmed. She was\nperfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same\nstory had been told. The name escaped her. What was the name? Oh, what\nwas the name? She clasped her knees for the name. Something in\nThackeray. She struck her matronly forehead.Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.“I must go,” she said gravely. “Don’t be silly. You always overdo it\nwhen you play.”As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil\nair, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it\nright. Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made\nher connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of\nnondescript tourists. Hitherto truth had come to her naturally. She saw\nthat for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely\ntruthful? Well, at all events, she must not tell lies. She hurried up\nthe garden, still flushed with shame. A word from Cecil would soothe\nher, she was sure.“Cecil!”“Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He seemed\nin high spirits. “I was hoping you’d come. I heard you all\nbear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here. I, even I, have won a\ngreat victory for the Comic Muse. George Meredith’s right—the cause of\nComedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have\nfound tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa. Don’t be angry! Don’t\nbe angry! You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.”He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled\nher ridiculous forebodings at once.“I have heard,” she said. “Freddy has told us. Naughty Cecil! I suppose\nI must forgive you. Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!\nCertainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have\nnice friends of yours. But you oughtn’t to tease one so.”"

  "content": "“Friends of mine?” he laughed. “But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!\nCome here.” But she remained standing where she was. “Do you know where\nI met these desirable tenants? In the National Gallery, when I was up\nto see my mother last week.”“What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously. “I don’t quite\nunderstand.”“In the Umbrian Room. Absolute strangers. They were admiring Luca\nSignorelli—of course, quite stupidly. However, we got talking, and they\nrefreshed me not a little. They had been to Italy.”“But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country\ncottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends. I\nthought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their\naddress and a London reference, found they weren’t actual\nblackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—”“Cecil! No, it’s not fair. I’ve probably met them before—”He bore her down.“Perfectly fair. Anything is fair that punishes a snob. That old man\nwill do the neighbourhood a world of good. Sir Harry is too disgusting\nwith his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.\nNo, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with\nme. There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things. I believe in\ndemocracy—”“No, you don’t,” she snapped. “You don’t know what the word means.”He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be\nLeonardesque. “No, you don’t!”Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.“It isn’t fair, Cecil. I blame you—I blame you very much indeed. You\nhad no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look\nridiculous. You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that\nit is all at my expense? I consider it most disloyal of you.”She left him.“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness. As long as Lucy thought that\nhis own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not\nminded. He perceived that these new tenants might be of value\neducationally. He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who\nwas silent. In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would\nbring them to Windy Corner."

  "content": "Chapter XI\nIn Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed FlatThe Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not\ndisdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse. His idea of bringing the Emersons\nto Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through\nthe negotiations without a hitch. Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement,\nmet Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned. The Miss Alans were duly\noffended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held\nresponsible for the failure. Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the\nnew-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as\nsoon as they arrived. Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that\nshe permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his\nhead, to be forgotten, and to die.Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows\nbecause there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but\nsettled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.\nNow that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and\nwere welcome into the neighbourhood. And Cecil was welcome to bring\nwhom he would into the neighbourhood. Therefore Cecil was welcome to\nbring the Emersons into the neighbourhood. But, as I say, this took a\nlittle thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather\ngreater and rather more dreadful than it should have done. She was glad\nthat a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie\nVilla while she was safe in the London flat.“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept\ninto his arms.Cecil, too, became demonstrative. He saw that the needful fire had been\nkindled in Lucy. At last she longed for attention, as a woman should,\nand looked up to him because he was a man.“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do! I don’t know what I should do without you.”"

The coolness dated from what\nCharlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased\namazingly. For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval\nworld becomes exasperating in the classical. Charlotte, unselfish in\nthe Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in\nthe Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue\ntheir tour. Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs. Vyse was an\nacquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and\nMiss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned\nsuddenly. Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for\nLucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as\nfollows. It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.“TUNBRIDGE WELLS,\n“_September_.“DEAREST LUCIA,“I have news of you at last! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your\nparts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome. Puncturing her\ntire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very\nwoebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a\ndoor open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out. He said his\nfather had just taken the house. He _said_ he did not know that you\nlived in the neighbourhood (?). He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup\nof tea. Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean\nbreast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who\nwill forbid him to enter the house, etc. That was a great misfortune,\nand I dare say you have told them already. Mr. Vyse is so sensitive. I\nremember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome. I am very sorry about\nit all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.“Believe me,\n“Your anxious and loving cousin,\n“CHARLOTTE.”Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows:“BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.“DEAR CHARLOTTE,"

When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the\nmountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she\nwould blame you for not being always with me. I have kept that promise,\nand cannot possibly tell her now. I have said both to her and Cecil\nthat I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable\npeople—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no\ntea was probably that he had none himself. She should have tried at the\nRectory. I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage. You must see that\nit would be too absurd. If the Emersons heard I had complained of them,\nthey would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they\nare not. I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.\nAs for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for\nmyself. They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the\nother day. We expect to be married in January.“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy\nCorner at all, but here. Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your\nenvelope again. No one opens my letters.“Yours affectionately,\n“L. M. HONEYCHURCH.”Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we\ncannot tell whether our secret is important or not. Were Lucy and her\ncousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if\nhe discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at? Miss\nBartlett suggested the former. Perhaps she was right. It had become a\ngreat thing now. Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and\nher lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.\n“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago. She tried to\ntell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady\nwho had smitten his heart at school. But her body behaved so\nridiculously that she stopped.She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis\nvisiting the scenes they were to know so well later on. It did her no\nharm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society\nitself was absent on the golf-links or the moors. The weather was cool,\nand it did her no harm. In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to\nscrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren\nof famous people. The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness\nthat impressed the girl. One was tired of everything, it seemed. One\nlaunched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself\nup amid sympathetic laughter. In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini\nand Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London\ncareer would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the\npast.The grandchildren asked her to play the piano."

  "content": "She played Schumann. “Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the\nquerulous beauty of the music had died. She shook her head and played\nSchumann again. The melody rose, unprofitably magical. It broke; it was\nresumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave. The\nsadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should\nnever be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of\nthe audience throb. Not thus had she played on the little draped piano\nat the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr.\nBeebe had passed to himself when she returned.When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up\nand down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.\nMrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s,\nhad been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among\nmany people. The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had\nseen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her\nabilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he\nwas not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end\nof each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.\n“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.”“Her music always was wonderful.”“Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent\nHoneychurches, but you know what I mean. She is not always quoting\nservants, or asking one how the pudding is made.”“Italy has done it.”“Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy\nto her. “It is just possible. Cecil, mind you marry her next January.\nShe is one of us already.”“But her music!” he exclaimed. “The style of her! How she kept to\nSchumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven. Schumann was right\nfor this evening. Schumann was the thing. Do you know, mother, I shall\nhave our children educated just like Lucy. Bring them up among honest\ncountry folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and\nthen—not till then—let them come to London. I don’t believe in these\nLondon educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one\nhimself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.”“Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s\nroom. Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought\nit kind to go herself. She found the girl sitting upright with her hand\non her cheek.“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.”“Bad dreams?”"

Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.\nDarkness enveloped the flat.Chapter XII\nTwelfth ChapterIt was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains,\nand the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.\nAll that was gracious triumphed. As the motorcars passed through Summer\nStreet they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon\ndispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or\nof the pines. Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over\nhis Rectory gate. Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.”“M’m.”“They might amuse you.”Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new\npeople might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just\nmoved in.“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe. “They are worth\nit.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to\nCissie Villa. “Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through\nwhich much squalor was visible.A grave voice replied, “Hullo!”“I’ve brought someone to see you.”“I’ll be down in a minute.”The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed\nto carry up the stairs. Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty. The\nsitting-room itself was blocked with books.“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered. “Are they that\nsort?”“I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment. What have they\ngot? Byron. Exactly. A Shropshire Lad. Never heard of it. The Way of\nAll Flesh. Never heard of it. Gibbon. Hullo! dear George reads German.\nUm—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.

Come\nand have a bathe.”“Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.“‘How d’ye do? how d’ye do? Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.\n“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard. But I’m afraid\nit will only act between men. Can you picture a lady who has been\nintroduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How\ndo you do? Come and have a bathe’? And yet you will tell me that the\nsexes are equal.”"

I tell you they\nshall be comrades, and George thinks the same.”“We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you\nplace in the past, is really yet to come. We shall enter it when we no\nlonger despise our bodies.”Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead. We despise the body less\nthan women do. But not until we are comrades shall we enter the\ngarden.”“I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass\nof philosophy that was approaching him.“I believed in a return to Nature once. But how can we return to Nature\nwhen we have never been with her? To-day, I believe that we must\ndiscover Nature. After many conquests we shall attain simplicity. It is\nour heritage.”“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at\nFlorence.”“How do you do? Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George\nfor a bathe. Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.\nMarriage is a duty. I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr.\nVyse, too. He has been most kind. He met us by chance in the National\nGallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house. Though I\nhope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway. I have met so few Liberal\nlandowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game\nlaws with the Conservative attitude. Ah, this wind! You do well to\nbathe. Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!”“Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy. “I must—that is to say, I have to—have the\npleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.”“_Call_, my lad? Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? Call on your\ngrandmother! Listen to the wind among the pines! Yours is a glorious\ncountry.”Mr. Beebe came to the rescue."

Bring them back\nto tea. Bring back some milk, cakes, honey. The change will do you\ngood. George has been working very hard at his office. I can’t believe\nhe’s well.”George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of\none who has handled furniture.“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him. “It is only a pond,\ndon’t you know. I dare say you are used to something better.”“Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.”Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of\nthe house and into the pine-woods. How glorious it was! For a little\ntime the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes\nand philosophy. It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing\nthe bracken and the trees. Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who\ncould not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition\nlooked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a\nword. He spoke of Florence. George attended gravely, assenting or\ndissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as\ninexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse! Did you realize\nthat you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?”“I did not. Miss Lavish told me.”“When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of\nCoincidence.’”No enthusiasm.“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we\nsuppose. For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here\nnow, when one comes to reflect.”To his relief, George began to talk.“It is. I have reflected. It is Fate. Everything is Fate. We are flung\ntogether by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart. The\ntwelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—”"

Now I’ll cross-question you.\nWhere did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?”“Italy.”“And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss\nHoneychurch?”“National Gallery.”“Looking at Italian art. There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence\nand Fate. You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our\nfriends. This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.”“It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George. “But you can call it\nItaly if it makes you less unhappy.”Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject. But he\nwas infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is\nstill to write.”Silence.Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that\nyou have come.”Silence.“Here we are!” called Freddy.“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.“In there’s the pond. I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles. There lay the pond,\nset in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain\nthe human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky. On account of the\nrains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like\na beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe. “No\napologies are necessary for the pond.”George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his\nboots.“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid? I love willow-herb in\nseed. What’s the name of this aromatic plant?”No one knew, or seemed to care.“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of\nwater plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or\nbrittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines. Very charming, very charming.”“Mr. Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.Mr. Beebe thought he was not.“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in."

Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of\napathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were\na statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds. It was necessary to use his\nmuscles. It was necessary to keep clean. Mr. Beebe watched them, and\nwatched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their\nheads.“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes\nin either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded\nmargin.The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed\nthe question properly.“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful,\nwater’s simply ripping.”“Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and\nsputtering at the sun.“Water’s wonderful. Mr. Beebe, do.”“Apooshoo, kouf.”Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible,\nlooked around him. He could detect no parishioners except the\npine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other\nagainst the blue. How glorious it was! The world of motor-cars and\nrural Deans receded inimitably. Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these\nthings not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the\nintrusion of man?“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little\npile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy\nsaid, it reminded one of swimming in a salad. The three gentlemen\nrotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in\nGötterdämmerung. But either because the rains had given a freshness or\nbecause the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of\nthe gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for\nsome reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and\nBotany and Fate. They began to play. Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each\nother. A little deferentially, they splashed George. He was quiet: they\nfeared they had offended him. Then all the forces of youth burst out.\nHe smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked\nthem, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool."

And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the\nsward, proclaiming:“No. We are what matters. Without us shall no enterprise begin. To us\nshall all flesh turn in the end.”“A try! A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing\nit beside an imaginary goal-post.“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a\nkick.“Goal!”“Goal!”“Pass!”“Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.Clothes flew in all directions.“Take care my hat! No, that’s enough, Freddy. Dress now. No, I say!”But the two young men were delirious. Away they twinkled into the\ntrees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a\nwide-awake hat on his dripping hair.“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in\nhis own parish. Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a\nRural Dean. “Hi! Steady on! I see people coming you fellows!”Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.“Hi! hi! _Ladies!_”Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined. Still, they did not hear\nMr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch,\nCecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.\nFreddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some\nbracken. George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down\nthe path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. “Whoever were those\nunfortunate people? Oh, dears, look away! And poor Mr. Beebe, too!\nWhatever has happened?”“Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he\nmust lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though\nhe knew not against what.

What miserable management! Why\nnot have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?”“Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and\nif another fellow—”“Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to\nargue. Come, Lucy.” They turned. “Oh, look—don’t look! Oh, poor Mr.\nBeebe! How unfortunate again—”For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface\ngarments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary\nGeorge, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken. “I’ve\nswallowed a pollywog. It wriggleth in my tummy. I shall die—Emerson you\nbeast, you’ve got on my bags.”“Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain\nshocked. “And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first. All these\ncolds come of not drying thoroughly.”“Mother, do come away,” said Lucy. “Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.”“Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.He regarded himself as dressed. Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and\npersonable against the shadowy woods, he called:“Hullo, Miss Honeychurch! Hullo!”“Bow, Lucy; better bow. Whoever is it? I shall bow.”Miss Honeychurch bowed.That evening and all that night the water ran away. On the morrow the\npool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory. It had been a call\nto the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose\ninfluence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for\nyouth.Chapter XIII\nHow Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome"

Who could foretell that she and\nGeorge would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of\ncoats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth? She\nhad imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or\nindifferent or furtively impudent. She was prepared for all of these.\nBut she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with\nthe shout of the morning star.Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she\nreflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree\nof accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the\nscenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the\nstage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too\nmuch. “I will bow,” she had thought. “I will not shake hands with him.\nThat will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom? To\ngods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She had bowed across\nthe rubbish that cumbers the world.So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil. It was\nanother of those dreadful engagement calls. Mrs. Butterworth had wanted\nto see him, and he did not want to be seen. He did not want to hear\nabout hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside. He did\nnot want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and\nmade long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done. Lucy\nsoothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised\nwell for their married peace. No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser\nto discover the imperfections before wedlock. Miss Bartlett, indeed,\nthough not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains\nnothing satisfactory. Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded\nthe teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter\nwith Cecil?”The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with\ncharity and restraint.“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.”“Perhaps he’s tired.”Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering\ndispleasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.”“I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.”"

If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets\nrid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.“Now, mother! I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!”“Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck. But not in that way.\nNo. It is the same with Cecil all over.”“By-the-by—I never told you. I had a letter from Charlotte while I was\naway in London.”This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs.\nHoneychurch resented it.“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.\nWhenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to\ncontradict me. No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor\nintellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture;\nyour father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly\nremember.”“I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to. But he does\nnot mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset\nhim—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.”“Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?”“You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we\ndo.”“Then why didn’t he leave the room?

Something had\nenfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so\nperfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form. The two\ncivilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was\ndazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all\ncivilization had blinded her eyes. Good taste and bad taste were only\ncatchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a\nwhisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from\nthe comic song.She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her\nfrock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made\nthings no better. There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to\nbe supercilious, and he had succeeded. And Lucy—she knew not why—wished\nthat the trouble could have come at any other time.“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.”“All right, mother—”“Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop. Go.”She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window. It faced\nnorth, so there was little view, and no view of the sky. Now, as in the\nwinter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes. One connected the\nlanding window with depression. No definite problem menaced her, but\nshe sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It\nseemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly. And she ought\nnot to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter. She must be more careful;\nher mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was\nabout. Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding\nupstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.“I say, those are topping people.”“My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been! You have no business to take\nthem bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public. It was all right\nfor you but most awkward for everyone else. Do be more careful. You\nforget the place is growing half suburban.”“I say, is anything on to-morrow week?”“Not that I know of.”“Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.”“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this\nmuddle.”“What’s wrong with the court?
