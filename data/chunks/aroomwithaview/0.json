She promised us south rooms with a view close\ntogether, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a\ncourtyard, and a long way apart. Oh, Lucy!”“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by\nthe Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at\nthe two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the\nrow of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between\nthe English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late\nPoet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at\nthe notice of the English church (Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.),\nthat was the only other decoration of the wall. “Charlotte, don’t you\nfeel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all\nkinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s being so\ntired.”“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying\ndown her fork.“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her\nletter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to\ndo it at all. Oh, it is a shame!”“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard\nthat you shouldn’t have a view.”Lucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me:\nof course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first\nvacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part\nof whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of\ngenerosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.“No, no. You must have it.”“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”“She would never forgive _me_.”The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a\nlittle peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness\nthey wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one\nof them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant\nforward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He\nsaid:“I have a view, I have a view.”"

  "content": "Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them\nover for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that\nthey would “do” till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was\nill-bred, even before she glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy\nbuild, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something\nchildish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.\nWhat exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her\nglance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her. He was\nprobably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the\nswim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then\nsaid: “A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view\ntoo.”“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll\nhave yours. We’ll change.”The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with\nthe new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as\npossible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the\nquestion.”“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again\nrepressed her.“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And\nhe thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son,\nsaying, “George, persuade them!”“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s\nnothing else to say.”He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed\nand sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in\nfor what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that\nwhenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened\ntill it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something\nquite different, whose existence she had not realized before. Now the\nold man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not\nchange? What possible objection had she? They would clear out in half\nan hour.Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was\npowerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any\none so gross. Her face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as\nmuch as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who\nwere sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs\nof the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are\ngenteel.”"

  "content": "“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with\nthe meat that she had once censured.Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will\nmake a change.”Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The\ncurtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout\nbut attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,\ncheerfully apologizing for his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired\ndecency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr.\nBeebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,\nhowever bad the rooms are. Oh!”Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you\nhelped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember\nthe ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward\npleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by\nLucy.“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of\nspiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her\ncousin had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer\nStreet, too, makes it so specially funny.”“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss\nBartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the\ncourse of conversation that you have just accepted the living—”“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you\nat Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe\nis—’”“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer\nStreet next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming\nneighbourhood.”“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe\nbowed.“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not\noften we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”"

He asked the\ngirl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length\nthat she had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a\nnewcomer, and he was first in the field. “Don’t neglect the country\nround,” his advice concluded. “The first fine afternoon drive up to\nFiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.”“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are\nwrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We\nare in luck.”And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People\ntold them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams,\nhow to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter,\nhow much the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had\ndecided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way\nthey looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose\nthe voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato! They must go to Prato.\nThat place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in\nshaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.”The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then\nreturned moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do.\nLucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave\nher no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when\nshe rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous\nlittle bow.The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,\nbut by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across\nsomething."

  "content": "She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the\ncurtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with\nmore than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing\ngood-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy,\nand Victorier, her daughter. It made a curious little scene, this\nattempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.\nAnd even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival\nthe solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really\nItaly?Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which\nhad the colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr.\nBeebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and\nforwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some\ninvisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to you,” she was saying. “The\nfirst evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a\npeculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.”He expressed his regret.“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us\nat dinner?”“Emerson.”“Is he a friend of yours?”“We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”“Then I will say no more.”He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin,\nLucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation\nto people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.\nI hope I acted for the best.”“You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after a\nfew moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have\ncome of accepting.”“No _harm_, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”“He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said\ngently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor\nexpect you to show gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying\nexactly what he means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks\nyou would value them. He no more thought of putting you under an\nobligation than he thought of being polite. It is so difficult—at\nleast, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.”Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so\nalways hope that people will be nice.”"

But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When\nhe first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no\ntact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he\nwill not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about him\nto our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of\nit.”“Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching\nof the lips.“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”“I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a\nnice creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his\nfather’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a\nSocialist.”“Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to have\naccepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and\nsuspicious?”“Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”“But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent\nrudeness?”He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,\nand got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why\ndidn’t you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I\nhaven’t monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as\nwell as all dinner-time.”“He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see\ngood in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”“My dear Lucia—”“Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally\nlaugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”“Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will\napprove of Mr. Beebe.”“I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”“I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable\nworld. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind\nthe times.”“Yes,” said Lucy despondently."

  "content": "There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval\nwas of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy\nCorner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not\ndetermine. She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss\nBartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am\nafraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.”And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must\nbe more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been\nsmiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed\nto sit where Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to\nchatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the\ngratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s\nhealth, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of\nthoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning. She handled her\nsubjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention\nthan the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was\nproceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real\ncatastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when\nshe had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea,\nthough one better than something else.“But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so\nEnglish.”“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”“Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If only Mr. Emerson\nwas more tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”“I think he was meaning to be kind.”“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.“Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of\ncourse, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.”“Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could\nnot be too careful with a young girl.Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No\none was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not\nnoticed it.“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have\nyou ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most\nindelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?”“Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. “Are not beauty\nand delicacy the same?”"

  "content": "“So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are\nso difficult, I sometimes think.”She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking\nextremely pleasant.“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so\nglad. Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing\nwhat I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me\ncome and ask you. He would be so pleased.”“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.\nThe old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”Miss Bartlett was silent.“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I\nmust apologize for my interference.”Gravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett\nreply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with\nyours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at\nFlorence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to\nturn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,\nMr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and\nthen conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?”She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the\ndrawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The\nclergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with\nher message.“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the\nacceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:“Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.”The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the\nfloor, so low were their chairs.“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him\npersonally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to\nhim as soon as he comes out.”Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came\nforth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to\nthe delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy."

  "content": "“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.“How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do\nto keep polite.”“In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then\nlooking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own\nrooms, to write up his philosophic diary.“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the\nwinds of heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not\nrealize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand\nand a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly\nrealize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either, was\nreduced to literature. Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy,\nshe committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.\nFor she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the\nhalf-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a\nsigh, and said:“I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will\nsuperintend the move.”“How you do do everything,” said Lucy.“Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”“But I would like to help you.”“No, dear.”Charlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her\nlife, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So\nLucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in\nher which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less\ndelicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room\nwithout any feeling of joy.“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken\nthe largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;\nbut I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure\nyour mother would not like it.”Lucy was bewildered."

I am a woman of the world, in\nmy small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a\nguarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.”“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of\nlarger and unsuspected issues.Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as\nshe wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and\nwhen she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the\nclean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to\nsee the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato,\nand the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the\ndoor, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards\nled, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was\nthen that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on\nwhich was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the\nlight of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,\nobnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to\ndestroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,\nsince it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it\ncarefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it\nclean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed\nheavily according to her habit, and went to bed.Chapter II\nIn Santa Croce with No BaedekerIt was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright\nbare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are\nnot; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini\nsport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too,\nto fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar\nfastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees\nand marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling\nagainst the embankment of the road."

  "content": "Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy\nforeshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for\nsome mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the\nwindow. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms\nwere overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried\nto hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their\nfaces to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared—good-looking,\nundersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a\ngreat-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them\nwalked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went\nlittle boys, turning somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar\nbecame entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a\ncaterpillar in a swarm of ants. One of the little boys fell down, and\nsome white bullocks came out of an archway. Indeed, if it had not been\nfor the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the\nroad might never have got clear.Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and\nthe traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of\nGiotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing\nbut the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as\nwell that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on\nLucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window\nbefore she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the\nbest of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her cousin\nhad done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the\ncrumbs.A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett was,\nafter all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the\nmorning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy\nwould rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but,\nof course, she could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of\ncourse she would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy\nwould stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!At this point the clever lady broke in.“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you\ncan neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be\nperfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa\nBaroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to\nschool with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one\ntakes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained\ntightly behind.”Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s\ndaughters. She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being\nso very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a\nlong morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be\ndelighted.“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you\nbring me luck, we shall have an adventure.”"

He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true\nItaly—he does not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found\nby patient observation.”This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and\nstarted with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.\nThe Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right\nalong the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down the\nside streets cut like a knife, didn’t it? Ponte alle\nGrazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San\nMiniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a\nmurderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the\nriver were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is most information.) Then\nMiss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she\nstopped, and she cried:“A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has\nits own smell.”“Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother\na distaste to dirt.“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes\nfor life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at\nthat adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple\nsoul!”So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,\nshort, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s\ngrace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so\ncheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,\nonly increased the sense of festivity.“Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never\nrepent of a little civility to your inferiors. _That_ is the true\ndemocracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re\nshocked.”"

About five miles from Dorking, looking over\nthe Weald.”Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.“What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very\nnicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there\nwas?”“Very well indeed.”“And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”“Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you\nhave property in Surrey?”“Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty\nacres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.”Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her\naunt’s Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last\nname of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street\nthe other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And\njust as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:“Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the\ntower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But\nMiss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that\nLucy had followed her with no misgivings.“Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have\ntaken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!\nWhat are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is\nwhat _I_ call an adventure.”Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,\nthat they should ask the way there."

We\nwill simply drift.”Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,\nneither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the\ncity abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa,\nand became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy\nappeared. She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the\nliving terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can\never stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from\nthe garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against\ncirclets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything more\nbeautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her\nforward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a\nmile.The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or\nrather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste\nout of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly of\nthe paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the\ngreat unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,\nlarge and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white\nfaçade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It\nwas Santa Croce. The adventure was over.“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to\nthem. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into\nthe church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!”“We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their\nrooms. They were so very kind.”“Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish. “They walk through my\nItaly like a pair of cows. It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to\nset an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who\ncouldn’t pass it.”“What would you ask us?”"

In this exalted mood\nthey reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it\nwhen Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:“There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!”And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak\nflapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an\nold man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The\nbeggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that\na young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly\ninto the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was\nreally almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her\nlocal-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both\ngesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly\nbecause Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her\nBaedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way\nabout in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never\nbe in Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,\ntalking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was\nfull of originality. Now she entered the church depressed and\nhumiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the\nFranciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful\nbuilding. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it\ncontained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values\nshe was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell her\nwhich they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be\nenthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was\nno one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved\nthe nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one\nthat had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin."

  "content": "Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of\nacquiring information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the\nItalian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into\nthe church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and\nout of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,\nnot to spit. She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their\nBaedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that\novertook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their\ncareer by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to\nthe Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it\nvery slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with\ntheir fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then\nretreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy\nrealized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to\nacquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby\nstumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr.\nRuskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.\nProtestant as she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell\nheavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had\ndarted forward also. “Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the\nsunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where\nyou ought to be. Intolerable bishop!”The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful\npeople who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him\nnot to be superstitious.“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. “Here’s a mess: a baby hurt,\ncold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?”The child’s legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.\nEmerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an\nItalian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the\nrescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she\nstiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his\nknees. He stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson. “You have done more than\nall the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe\nin those who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of\nthe universe—”He paused for a phrase.“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was\ndetermined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and,\nif possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious\nreference to the pleasant rooms.“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply. “But what\nare you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the\nchurch?”“No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. “I came here with Miss\nLavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too\nbad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come\nin by myself.”“Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson."

  "content": "“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the\nyoung lady for the first time.“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.”“Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson. “I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded. It’s\nworth minding, the loss of a Baedeker. _That’s_ worth minding.”Lucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not\nsure whither it would lead her.“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this\nwhere the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not\nsuppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the\nchild, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.\nI hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.”“My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating\nwhat you have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy;\nbut you are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead\nwhat part of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a\nreal pleasure.”Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been\nfurious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is\ndifficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.\nEmerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him. On the\nother hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to\nbe offended with him, or at all events be offended before him. It was\nat him that she gazed before replying.“I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you\nwill kindly tell me which they are.”The son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to\nthe Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt\nlike a child in school who had answered a question rightly.The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of\nthem rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship\nGiotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit."

  "content": "“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce;\nhow it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before\nany taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these\nfrescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the\nsnares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic,\nmore pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge\nand technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!”“No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.\n“Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means\nthe workmen weren’t paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no\ntruth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I\ndo, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.”He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside,\nthe lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted\nuneasily, and so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with\nthese men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and\nso strange that she could not remember how to behave.“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it? Yes or no?”George replied:“It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to\nheaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should\nlike my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”“You will never go up,” said his father. “You and I, dear boy, will lie\nat peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as\nsurely as our work survives.”“Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint,\nwhoever he is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at\nall.”“Pardon me,” said a frigid voice. “The chapel is somewhat small for two\nparties. We will incommode you no longer.”The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,\nfor they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They\nfiled out of the chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little\nold ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine\nAlan.“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson. “There’s plenty of room for us all. Stop!”The procession disappeared without a word.Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the\nlife of St. Francis.“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.”George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is. I\ndon’t remember.”"

Then perhaps he will come back.”“He will not come back,” said George.But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the\nRev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear\nthe lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old\nman, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every\nlittle contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her. “He\nwill try to be kind.”“I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.“Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people\nbecause he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or\nfrightened.”“How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I\nthink that a kind action done tactfully—”“Tact!”He threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong\nanswer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.\nFor a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon\nit—hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again\nat Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of\nacorns. Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,\nof tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon\npassed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. Born\nof silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,\nand she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone\nfamiliar to her.“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people. They\nwon’t come back.”“...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in\nothers...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on\nSt. Francis came floating round the partition wall.“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy. “Have you looked at\nthose saints?”"

Do you know which is the tombstone\nthat is praised in Ruskin?”He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.\nGeorge, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man\nwandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a\nbarn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were\nalso beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old\nlady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his\nMass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half\ninterested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had\nimpaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in\nit.”“I like Giotto,” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about\nhis tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies\nbetter.”“So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby’s worth the\nwhole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.”Lucy again felt that this did not do.“In Hell,” he repeated. “He’s unhappy.”“Oh, dear!” said Lucy.“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive? What more is one to\ngive him? And think how he has been brought up—free from all the\nsuperstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the\nname of God. With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to\ngrow up happy.”She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old\nman, as well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother\nmight not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte\nwould object most strongly.“What are we to do with him?” he asked. “He comes out for his holiday\nto Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to\nhave been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What\ndid you say?”Lucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said:"

It is quite true. They don’t.”“Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?”In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting\npoetry, he said:“‘From far, from eve and morning,\n    And yon twelve-winded sky,\nThe stuff of life to knit me\n    Blew hither: here am I’George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?

Make him realize that by the side of\nthe everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a\nYes.”Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy\nbecause the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind,\nor a Yes, or something!“I’m very sorry,” she cried. “You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then\nshe became matronly. “Oh, but your son wants employment. Has he no\nparticular hobby? Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally\nforget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for\nmy brother.
