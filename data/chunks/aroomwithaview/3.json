There they still are!”“I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.”“Peeping like that! Can’t I look out of my own window?”But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her\nson, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves. For\na brief space they were silent. Close by, beyond the curtains, the\ngentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.”\nHe gave a nervous gulp. “Not content with ‘permission’, which I did\ngive—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with\nthat, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy. He\npractically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and\nfor Windy Corner generally if he married her? And he would have an\nanswer—he said it would strengthen his hand.”“I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.”“I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth. “There! Fly into a\nstew! I can’t help it—had to say it. I had to say no. He ought never to\nhave asked me.”“Ridiculous child!” cried his mother. “You think you’re so holy and\ntruthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that\na man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I\nhope he boxed your ears. How dare you say no?”“Oh, do keep quiet, mother! I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes. I\ntried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed\ntoo, and went away, it may be all right. But I feel my foot’s in it.\nOh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.”“No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the\nsubject, “I shall not keep quiet. You know all that has passed between\nthem in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately\ninsult him, and try to turn him out of my house.”“Not a bit!” he pleaded. “I only let out I didn’t like him. I don’t\nhate him, but I don’t like him. What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.”"

He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well\nconnected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face\nremained dissatisfied. She added: “And he has beautiful manners.”“I liked him till just now. I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s\nfirst week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not\nknowing.”“Mr. Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest. “I don’t\nsee how Mr. Beebe comes in.”“You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he\nmeans. He said: ‘Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I\nasked him what he meant. He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I\ncouldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking. Since Cecil has\ncome after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.”“You never can, dear. But I can. You are jealous of Cecil because he\nmay stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.”The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it. But at\nthe back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust. Cecil praised one\ntoo much for being athletic. Was that it? Cecil made one talk in one’s\nown way. This tired one. Was that it? And Cecil was the kind of fellow\nwho would never wear another fellow’s cap. Unaware of his own\nprofundity, Freddy checked himself. He must be jealous, or he would not\ndislike a man for such foolish reasons."

But Lucy seems very\nuncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’\nI said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.\nShe goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a\nthick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks\nwhere you turn on the electric light. She keeps that flat abominably—”“Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the\ncountry?”“Don’t interrupt so foolishly. Where was I? Oh yes—‘Young people must\ndecide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your son, because she\ntells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her\nfirst.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing. I’ll\nstop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out,\ntoo?”“Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my\npermission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I\nhave told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days\nyoung people must decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your\nson, because she tells me everything. But I do not know—’”“Look out!” cried Freddy.The curtains parted.Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation. He couldn’t bear the\nHoneychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.\nInstinctively he gave the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging\ndown their poles. Light entered. There was revealed a terrace, such as\nis owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little\nrustic seat, and two flower-beds. But it was transfigured by the view\nbeyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the\nSussex Weald. Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a\ngreen magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.Cecil entered."

  "content": "Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described. He\nwas medieval. Like a Gothic statue. Tall and refined, with shoulders\nthat seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was\ntilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled\nthose fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.\nWell educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained\nin the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as\nself-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision,\nworshipped as asceticism. A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a\nGreek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe\nmeant. And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same\nwhen he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards\nher young acquaintance.“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!”“I promessi sposi,” said he.They stared at him anxiously.“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English\nmade him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand\nthat was yellow with chemicals. They wished that they also knew\nItalian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected\nwith little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones. We are\nobliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural\nreminiscences.“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand\nat the furniture. “This is indeed a joyous day! I feel sure that you\nwill make our dear Lucy happy.”“I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was\naffected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most. Why\ncould she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room;\nlooking very cross and almost handsome?“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.Lucy rose from the seat. She moved across the lawn and smiled in at\nthem, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she saw\nher brother’s face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. He\nsaid, “Steady on!”“Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.Lucy kissed her also.“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all\nabout it?” Cecil suggested. “And I’d stop here and tell my mother.”“We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.“Yes, you go with Lucy.”"

  "content": "They passed into the sunlight. Cecil watched them cross the terrace,\nand descend out of sight by the steps. They would descend—he knew their\nways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,\nuntil they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of\nthe potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that\nhad led to such a happy conclusion.He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who\nhappened to be musical. He could still remember his depression that\nafternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of\nthe blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s. That day she had\nseemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel. But\nItaly worked some marvel in her. It gave her light, and—which he held\nmore precious—it gave her shadow. Soon he detected in her a wonderful\nreticence. She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love\nnot so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.\nThe things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could\nhave anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully\nday by day.So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if\nnot to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness. Already at Rome he\nhad hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other. It had\ntouched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion. Her\nrefusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase\nwent—she had been exactly the same to him as before. Three months\nlater, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked\nher again in bald, traditional language. She reminded him of a Leonardo\nmore than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock;\nat his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with\nimmeasurable plains behind her. He walked home with her unashamed,\nfeeling not at all like a rejected suitor. The things that really\nmattered were unshaken."

  "content": "So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she\nhad accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply\nsaying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy. His\nmother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must\nwrite her a long account.Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on\nit, he moved to the writing table. There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,”\nfollowed by many erasures. He recoiled without reading any more, and\nafter a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on\nhis knee.Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as\nthe first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner\ndrawing-room more distinctive. With that outlook it should have been a\nsuccessful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he\ncould almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.\nMaple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished\nbook-cases, that writing-table. The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s\nletter. He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay\nin that direction; but he worried about it none the less. It was his\nown fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted\nher support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that\nothers, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked\ntheir permission. Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in\nessentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected. “I\nrepresent all that he despises. Why should he want me for a\nbrother-in-law?”The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that\nLucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very\ndefinitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as\nsoon as possible.“Mr. Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was\nshown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s\npraise of him in her letters from Florence.Cecil greeted him rather critically.“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse. Do you suppose that I shall get it?”“I should say so. Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that\nchair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.”“Pfui!”"

  "content": "“I know,” said Cecil. “I know. I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch\nallows it.”For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he\ndid not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the\nlife that he desired.“I’ve come for tea and for gossip. Isn’t this news?”“News? I don’t understand you,” said Cecil. “News?”Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I\nam first in the field. He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!”“Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself. Into what a\ngrotesque mistake had he fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a\ngentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? But\nhis stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert\nmight be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.“Unpardonable question! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not\nto have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been\nrun up opposite the church! I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.”“I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man\nlanguidly. “I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish\nCouncil and a Local Government Board. Perhaps there is no difference,\nor perhaps those aren’t the right names. I only go into the country to\nsee my friends and to enjoy the scenery. It is very remiss of me. Italy\nand London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on\nsufferance.”Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert,\ndetermined to shift the subject.“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?”“I have no profession,” said Cecil. “It is another example of my\ndecadence. My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I\nam no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like. I know I ought\nto be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t\ncare a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.”"

  "content": "“You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe. “It is a wonderful\nopportunity, the possession of leisure.”His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to\nanswering naturally. He felt, as all who have regular occupation must\nfeel, that others should have it also.“I am glad that you approve. I daren’t face the healthy person—for\nexample, Freddy Honeychurch.”“Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?”“Admirable. The sort who has made England what she is.”Cecil wondered at himself. Why, on this day of all others, was he so\nhopelessly contrary? He tried to get right by inquiring effusively\nafter Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular\nregard. Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his\nliberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and\nscience.“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting\ntea before evening service.”“I suppose Anne never told them you were here. In this house one is so\ncoached in the servants the day one arrives. The fault of Anne is that\nshe begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the\nchair-legs with her feet. The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of\nMary, but they are very grave. Shall we look in the garden?”“I know the faults of Mary. She leaves the dust-pans standing on the\nstairs.”“The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the\nsuet sufficiently small.”They both laughed, and things began to go better.“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.“Ah, he has too many. No one but his mother can remember the faults of\nFreddy. Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.”“She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.“I quite agree. At present she has none.”“At present?”"

  "content": "“I’m not cynical. I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss\nHoneychurch. Does it seem reasonable that she should play so\nwonderfully, and live so quietly? I suspect that one day she will be\nwonderful in both. The water-tight compartments in her will break down,\nand music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her heroically good,\nheroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.”Cecil found his companion interesting.“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?”“Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was\nnot wonderful, and at Florence. Since I came to Summer Street she has\nbeen away. You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps. Oh, I\nforgot; of course, you knew her before. No, she wasn’t wonderful in\nFlorence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.”“In what way?”Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and\ndown the terrace.“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next. There was\nsimply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them. I can\nshow you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a\nkite, Miss Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string\nbreaks.”The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he\nviewed things artistically. At the time he had given surreptitious tugs\nto the string himself.“But the string never broke?”“No. I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly\nhave heard Miss Bartlett fall.”“It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous,\ncontemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He\ncursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and\nthat Lucy was soaring up to reach him?“Broken? What do you mean?”“I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.”The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he\ncould not keep out of his voice.“I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you were intimate with\nher, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.\nMr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw\nLucy herself; yes, he was disappointed."

  "content": "Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down\nhis mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his action would get\nfrom the world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every\nthoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement. But he was\nsensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.Occasionally he could be quite crude.“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly. “I fear that\nLucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.”“Not that. But you ought to have stopped me. I know Miss Honeychurch\nonly a little as time goes. Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so\nfreely with any one; certainly not with you.”“You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?”Mr. Beebe pulled himself together. Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of\nplacing one in the most tiresome positions. He was driven to use the\nprerogatives of his profession.“No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at Florence that her\nquiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized\ndimly enough that she might take some momentous step. She has taken it.\nShe has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she\nhas learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will\ntell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to\nwave his hat at the approaching trio. He did not omit to do so. “She\nhas learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was\nnow also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable\nto her.”“Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping\ngarden. “Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?”Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. Youth seldom\ncriticizes the accomplished fact.“Indeed I have!” he cried. He looked at Lucy. In her presence he could\nnot act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology. “Mrs.\nHoneychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but\ngenerally I’m too shy. I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them,\ngrave and gay, great and small. I want them all their lives to be\nsupremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and\nmother. And now I want my tea.”"

There was no more heavy beneficence, no more\nattempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures. None\nof them dared or was able to be serious any more.An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all\nwho speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. Away from it, in the\nsolitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be\ncritical. But in its presence and in the presence of each other they\nwere sincerely hilarious. It has a strange power, for it compels not\nonly the lips, but the very heart. The chief parallel to compare one\ngreat thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien\ncreed. Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel\nsentimental. Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become\ntrue believers, in case any true believer should be present.So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon\nthey pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant\ntea-party. If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their\nhypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. Anne,\nputting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated\nthem greatly. They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she\ngave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. Mr. Beebe chirruped.\nFreddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family\nhonoured pun on fiance. Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised\nwell as a mother-in-law. As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had\nbeen built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as\nearnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of\njoy.Chapter IX\nLucy As a Work of ArtA few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made\nLucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood,\nfor naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying\na presentable man."

  "content": "Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was\nvery pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his\nlong, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him. People congratulated\nMrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased\nher, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy\ndowagers.At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s\nfigured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned\nnothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated\nby a sympathetic maid. They were gone some time, and Cecil was left\nwith the dowagers. When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had\nbeen.“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were\ndriving home.“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.“Is it typical of country society?”“I suppose so. Mother, would it be?”“Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember\nthe hang of one of the dresses.Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and\nsaid:“To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.”“I am so sorry that you were stranded.”“Not that, but the congratulations. It is so disgusting, the way an\nengagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where\nevery outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment. All those old women\nsmirking!”“One has to go through it, I suppose. They won’t notice us so much next\ntime.”“But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong. An\nengagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and\nshould be treated as such.”Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially\ncorrect. The spirit of the generations had smiled through them,\nrejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the\ncontinuance of life on earth. To Cecil and Lucy it promised something\nquite different—personal love. Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s\nbelief that his irritation was just.“How tiresome!” she said. “Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?”“I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public. The neighbourhood is\ndeprived of the romance of me being athletic. Such romance as I have is\nthat of the Inglese Italianato.”“Inglese Italianato?”“E un diavolo incarnato! You know the proverb?”"

But Cecil, since his engagement,\nhad taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from\npossessing.“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There\nare certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must\naccept them.”“We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her\nremark that she did not quite understand his position.“How?”“It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in,\nor whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?”She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert. “I don’t see any\ndifference. Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same\nplace.”“We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption\njarred.“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her\ncard-case on her lap. “This is me.

Motives are all very well, but the fence\ncomes here.”“We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.”She leant placidly back. Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and\nthat’s Mr. Beebe.”“A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.”Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect\nwhat they meant. She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling\nthat prompted it.“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.“I never said so!” he cried. “I consider him far above the average. I\nonly denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was\nbrilliant.“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something\nsympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful\nones, is Mr. Eager, the English chaplain at Florence. He was truly\ninsincere—not merely the manner unfortunate. He was a snob, and so\nconceited, and he did say such unkind things.”“What sort of things?”"

Mr. Eager would never come to the\npoint. He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered\nhis wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.”“Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate\nshould go round spreading slander? It was, I believe, chiefly owing to\nhim that the old man was dropped. People pretended he was vulgar, but\nhe certainly wasn’t that.”“Poor old man! What was his name?”“Harris,” said Lucy glibly.“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her\nmother.Cecil nodded intelligently.“Isn’t Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.“I don’t know. I hate him. I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto. I hate\nhim. Nothing can hide a petty nature. I _hate_ him.”“My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “You’ll blow\nmy head off! Whatever is there to shout over? I forbid you and Cecil to\nhate any more clergymen.”He smiled. There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s\nmoral outburst over Mr. Eager. It was as if one should see the Leonardo\non the ceiling of the Sistine. He longed to hint to her that not here\nlay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not\nin muscular rant. But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the\nbeautiful creature, but shows that she is alive. After a moment, he\ncontemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain\napproval. He forebore to repress the sources of youth."

Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of\nNature which is denied to us of the town. Do you feel that, Mrs.\nHoneychurch?”Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled. She had not been attending. Cecil,\nwho was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt\nirritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.Lucy had not attended either. Her brow was wrinkled, and she still\nlooked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral\ngymnastics. It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an\nAugust wood.“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and\ntouched her knee with his own.She flushed again and said: “What height?”“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,\nWhat pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).\nIn height and in the splendour of the hills?’Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.\nWhat’s this place?”“Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself."

Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church. In height it scarcely\nexceeded the cottages. Some great mansions were at hand, but they were\nhidden in the trees. The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the\nshrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly\nlittle villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement,\nhaving been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy\nhad been acquired by Cecil.“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.\nThese titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden\ngates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed\nthe semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals. “Albert”\nwas inhabited. His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and\nlobelias and polished shells. His little windows were chastely swathed\nin Nottingham lace. “Cissie” was to let. Three notice-boards, belonging\nto Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising\nfact. Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn\nwas yellow with dandelions.“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically. “Summer Street\nwill never be the same again.”As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came\nout of her.“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.\n“Here’s Sir Harry. Now we shall know. Sir Harry, pull those things down\nat once!”Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said\n“Mrs. Honeychurch, I meant to. I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss\nFlack.”“Am I not always right? She ought to have gone before the contract was\nsigned. Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s\ntime?”“But what can I do?” He lowered his voice. “An old lady, so very\nvulgar, and almost bedridden.”“Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely."

He had had full\nwarning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot\nbefore building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory. He had\nknown Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it\nbeing spoilt. Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and\nthe apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.\nHe called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and\nrespectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic\nroof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper. He ventured to differ,\nhowever, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches\nto the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked\nto relieve the façade by a bit of decoration. Sir Harry hinted that a\ncolumn, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and\nall the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another\napproaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s\ninitials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin. He built his\nvillas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an\nimmovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness\nas he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage. He had failed in his duties\nto the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.\nHe had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.\nAll he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone\nreally desirable.“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy\nlandlord. But it is such an awkward size. It is too large for the\npeasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.”Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or\ndespise Sir Harry for despising them. The latter impulse seemed the\nmore fruitful.“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously. “It would be\na perfect paradise for a bank clerk.”“Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly. “That is exactly what I fear, Mr.\nVyse. It will attract the wrong type of people. The train service has\nimproved—a fatal improvement, to my mind. And what are five miles from\na station in these days of bicycles?”“Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied\nthat the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most\nappalling rate. She saw that he was laughing at their harmless\nneighbour, and roused herself to stop him.“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea. How would you like\nspinsters?”“My dear Lucy, it would be splendid. Do you know any such?”“Yes; I met them abroad.”“Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively."

Extra facilities—please tell them they\nshall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees. Oh, the\nagents! The appalling people they have sent me! One woman, when I\nwrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social\nposition to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance. As if\none cares about that!

The\ndeceit of the most promising people. My dear Lucy, the deceit!”She nodded.“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with\nLucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all. I know the type. Preserve me\nfrom people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them\nthat make the house smell stuffy. It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather\nlet to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has\ncome down.”“I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very\nsad thing.”“The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.“Yes, they are,” said Cecil. “I haven’t met them but I should say they\nwere a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.”“Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.”“It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied. “I oughtn’t to come with my\ntroubles to young people. But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway\nwill only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no\nreal help.”“Then may I write to my Misses Alan?”“Please!”But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed:“Beware! They are certain to have canaries. Sir Harry, beware of\ncanaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then\nthe mice come. Beware of women altogether. Only let to a man.”“Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her\nremark."

Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much\ndistinction. He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time,\nshould descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself. She\nwas delighted. Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a\nhouse. Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they\nwere on a small scale.Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?”“Certainly!” was her cordial reply.Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.

Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety\nenough. She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some\ntime, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,\nduring the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them. Summer Street\nlay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged\nfrom the highroad.“Are there two ways?”“Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.”“I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued\nirritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon. “Why is it,\nLucy, that you always say the road? Do you know that you have never\nonce been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?”“Haven’t I? The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but\npretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave\nher in doubt as to his meaning.She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did\nexplain before they had gone a dozen yards.“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with\nme in a room.”“A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.“Yes. Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road. Never in the real\ncountry like this.”“Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean? I have never felt anything of the\nsort. You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.”“I don’t know that you aren’t. I connect you with a view—a certain type\nof view. Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?”She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing:“Do you know that you’re right? I do. I must be a poetess after all.\nWhen I think of you it’s always as in a room. How funny!”To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.“A drawing-room, pray? With no view?”“Yes, with no view, I fancy.

She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy\nCorner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy\nin it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to\nItaly, it had lost none of its charm.Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny\ngreen alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!”“Why do you call it that?”“I can’t remember why. I suppose it comes out of some book. It’s only a\npuddle now, but you see that stream going through it? Well, a good deal\nof water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and\nthe pool becomes quite large and beautiful. Then Freddy used to bathe\nthere.

Then there was a row.”At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of\nprudishness within him. But now? with his momentary cult of the fresh\nair, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity. He looked at her as\nshe stood by the pool’s edge. She was got up smart, as she phrased it,\nand she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its\nown, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.“Who found you out?”“Charlotte,” she murmured. “She was stopping with us.\nCharlotte—Charlotte.”“Poor girl!”She smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had\nshrunk, now appeared practical.“Lucy!”“Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.”At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards\nhim.“What, Cecil?”“Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry\nme—”He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were\nobserved.
