  "content": "Valancy had only one unhappy night that winter. It came in late March\nwhen most of the snow had gone and Nip and Tuck had returned. Barney\nhad gone off in the afternoon for a long, woodland tramp, saying he\nwould be back by dark if all went well. Soon after he had gone it had\nbegun to snow. The wind rose and presently Mistawis was in the grip of\none of the worst storms of the winter. It tore up the lake and struck\nat the little house. The dark angry woods on the mainland scowled at\nValancy, menace in the toss of their boughs, threats in their windy\ngloom, terror in the roar of their hearts. The trees on the island\ncrouched in fear. Valancy spent the night huddled on the rug before the\nfire, her face buried in her hands, when she was not vainly peering\nfrom the oriel in a futile effort to see through the furious smoke of\nwind and snow that had once been blue-dimpled Mistawis. Where was\nBarney? Lost on the merciless lakes? Sinking exhausted in the drifts of\nthe pathless woods? Valancy died a hundred deaths that night and paid\nin full for all the happiness of her Blue Castle. When morning came the\nstorm broke and cleared; the sun shone gloriously over Mistawis; and at\nnoon Barney came home. Valancy saw him from the oriel as he came around\na wooded point, slender and black against the glistening white world.\nShe did not run to meet him. Something happened to her knees and she\ndropped down on Banjo’s chair. Luckily Banjo got out from under in\ntime, his whiskers bristling with indignation. Barney found her there,\nher head buried in her hands.“Barney, I thought you were dead,” she whispered.Barney hooted.“After two years of the Klondike did you think a baby storm like this\ncould get me? I spent the night in that old lumber shanty over by\nMuskoka. A bit cold but snug enough. Little goose! Your eyes look like\nburnt holes in a blanket. Did you sit up here all night worrying over\nan old woodsman like me?”“Yes,” said Valancy. “I—couldn’t help it. The storm seemed so wild.\nAnybody might have been lost in it. When—I saw you—come round the\npoint—there—something happened to me. I don’t know what. It was as if I\nhad died and come back to life. I can’t describe it any other way.”CHAPTER XXXIIISpring. Mistawis black and sullen for a week or two, then flaming in\nsapphire and turquoise, lilac and rose again, laughing through the\noriel, caressing its amethyst islands, rippling under winds soft as\nsilk. Frogs, little green wizards of swamp and pool, singing everywhere\nin the long twilights and long into the nights; islands fairy-like in a\ngreen haze; the evanescent beauty of wild young trees in early leaf;\nfrost-like loveliness of the new foliage of juniper-trees; the woods\nputting on a fashion of spring flowers, dainty, spiritual things akin\nto the soul of the wilderness; red mist on the maples; willows decked\nout with glossy silver pussies; all the forgotten violets of Mistawis\nblooming again; lure of April moons.“Think how many thousands of springs have been here on Mistawis—and all\nof them beautiful,” said Valancy. “Oh, Barney, look at that wild plum!\nI will—I must quote from John Foster. There’s a passage in one of his\nbooks—I’ve re-read it a hundred times. He must have written it before a\ntree just like that:"

  "content": "“‘Behold the young wild plum-tree which has adorned herself after\nimmemorial fashion in a wedding-veil of fine lace. The fingers of wood\npixies must have woven it, for nothing like it ever came from an\nearthly loom. I vow the tree is conscious of its loveliness. It is\nbridling before our very eyes—as if its beauty were not the most\nephemeral thing in the woods, as it is the rarest and most exceeding,\nfor today it is and tomorrow it is not. Every south wind purring\nthrough the boughs will winnow away a shower of slender petals. But\nwhat matter? Today it is queen of the wild places and it is always\ntoday in the woods.’”“I’m sure you feel much better since you’ve got that out of your\nsystem,” said Barney heartlessly.“Here’s a patch of dandelions,” said Valancy, unsubdued. “Dandelions\nshouldn’t grow in the woods, though. They haven’t any sense of the\nfitness of things at all. They are too cheerful and self-satisfied.\nThey haven’t any of the mystery and reserve of the real wood-flowers.”“In short, they’ve no secrets,” said Barney. “But wait a bit. The woods\nwill have their own way even with those obvious dandelions. In a little\nwhile all that obtrusive yellowness and complacency will be gone and\nwe’ll find here misty, phantom-like globes hovering over those long\ngrasses in full harmony with the traditions of the forest.”“That sounds John Fosterish,” teased Valancy.“What have I done that deserved a slam like that?” complained Barney.One of the earliest signs of spring was the renaissance of Lady Jane.\nBarney put her on roads that no other car would look at, and they went\nthrough Deerwood in mud to the axles. They passed several Stirlings,\nwho groaned and reflected that now spring was come they would encounter\nthat shameless pair everywhere. Valancy, prowling about Deerwood shops,\nmet Uncle Benjamin on the street; but he did not realise until he had\ngone two blocks further on that the girl in the scarlet-collared\nblanket coat, with cheeks reddened in the sharp April air and the\nfringe of black hair over laughing, slanted eyes, was Valancy. When he\ndid realise it, Uncle Benjamin was indignant. What business had Valancy\nto look like—like—like a young girl? The way of the transgressor was\nhard. Had to be. Scriptural and proper. Yet Valancy’s path couldn’t be\nhard. She wouldn’t look like that if it were. There was something\nwrong. It was almost enough to make a man turn modernist."

  "content": "Barney and Valancy clanged on to the Port, so that it was dark when\nthey went through Deerwood again. At her old home Valancy, seized with\na sudden impulse, got out, opened the little gate and tiptoed around to\nthe sitting-room window. There sat her mother and Cousin Stickles\ndrearily, grimly knitting. Baffling and inhuman as ever. If they had\nlooked the least bit lonesome Valancy would have gone in. But they did\nnot. Valancy would not disturb them for worlds.CHAPTER XXXIVValancy had two wonderful moments that spring.One day, coming home through the woods, with her arms full of trailing\narbutus and creeping spruce, she met a man who she knew must be Allan\nTierney. Allan Tierney, the celebrated painter of beautiful women. He\nlived in New York in winter, but he owned an island cottage at the\nnorthern end of Mistawis to which he always came the minute the ice was\nout of the lake. He was reputed to be a lonely, eccentric man. He never\nflattered his sitters. There was no need to, for he would not paint any\none who required flattery. To be painted by Allan Tierney was all the\n_cachet_ of beauty a woman could desire. Valancy had heard so much\nabout him that she couldn’t help turning her head back over her\nshoulder for another shy, curious look at him. A shaft of pale spring\nsunlight fell through a great pine athwart her bare black head and her\nslanted eyes. She wore a pale green sweater and had bound a fillet of\nlinnæa vine about her hair. The feathery fountain of trailing spruce\noverflowed her arms and fell around her. Allan Tierney’s eyes lighted\nup.“I’ve had a caller,” said Barney the next afternoon, when Valancy had\nreturned from another flower quest.“Who?” Valancy was surprised but indifferent. She began filling a\nbasket with arbutus.“Allan Tierney. He wants to paint you, Moonlight.”“Me!” Valancy dropped her basket and her arbutus. “You’re laughing at\nme, Barney.”“I’m not. That’s what Tierney came for. To ask my permission to paint\nmy wife—as the Spirit of Muskoka, or something like that.”“But—but—” stammered Valancy, “Allan Tierney never paints any but—any\nbut——”“Beautiful women,” finished Barney. “Conceded. Q. E. D., Mistress\nBarney Snaith is a beautiful woman.”“Nonsense,” said Valancy, stooping to retrieve her arbutus. “You _know_\nthat’s nonsense, Barney. I know I’m a heap better-looking than I was a\nyear ago, but I’m not beautiful.”"

  "content": "“Allan Tierney never makes a mistake,” said Barney. “You forget,\nMoonlight, that there are different kinds of beauty. Your imagination\nis obsessed by the very obvious type of your cousin Olive. Oh, I’ve\nseen her—she’s a stunner—but you’d never catch Allan Tierney wanting to\npaint her. In the horrible but expressive slang phrase, she keeps all\nher goods in the shop-window. But in your subconscious mind you have a\nconviction that nobody can be beautiful who doesn’t look like Olive.\nAlso, you remember your face as it was in the days when your soul was\nnot allowed to shine through it. Tierney said something about the curve\nof your cheek as you looked back over your shoulder. You know I’ve\noften told you it was distracting. And he’s quite batty about your\neyes. If I wasn’t absolutely sure it was solely professional—he’s\nreally a crabbed old bachelor, you know—I’d be jealous.”“Well, I don’t want to be painted,” said Valancy. “I hope you told him\nthat.”“I couldn’t tell him that. I didn’t know what _you_ wanted. But I told\nhim _I_ didn’t want my wife painted—hung up in a salon for the mob to\nstare at. Belonging to another man. For of course I couldn’t buy the\npicture. So even if you had wanted to be painted, Moonlight, your\ntyrannous husband would not have permitted it. Tierney was a bit\nsquiffy. He isn’t used to being turned down like that. His requests are\nalmost like royalty’s.”“But we are outlaws,” laughed Valancy. “We bow to no decrees—we\nacknowledge no sovereignty.”In her heart she thought unashamedly:“I wish Olive could know that Allan Tierney wanted to paint me. _Me_!\nLittle-old-maid-Valancy-Stirling-that-was.”Her second wonder-moment came one evening in May. She realised that\nBarney actually liked her. She had always hoped he did, but sometimes\nshe had a little, disagreeable, haunting dread that he was just kind\nand nice and chummy out of pity; knowing that she hadn’t long to live\nand determined she should have a good time as long as she did live; but\naway back in his mind rather looking forward to freedom again, with no\nintrusive woman creature in his island fastness and no chattering thing\nbeside him in his woodland prowls. She knew he could never love her.\nShe did not even want him to. If he loved her he would be unhappy when\nshe died—Valancy never flinched from the plain word. No “passing away”\nfor her. And she did not want him to be the least unhappy. But neither\ndid she want him to be glad—or relieved. She wanted him to like her and\nmiss her as a good chum. But she had never been sure until this night\nthat he did."

They had the delight of\ndiscovering a virgin spring in a ferny hollow and had drunk together\nfrom it out of a birch-bark cup; they had come to an old tumble-down\nrail fence and sat on it for a long time. They didn’t talk much, but\nValancy had a curious sense of _oneness_. She knew that she couldn’t\nhave felt that if he hadn’t liked her.“You nice little thing,” said Barney suddenly. “Oh, you nice little\nthing! Sometimes I feel you’re too nice to be real—that I’m just\ndreaming you.”“Why can’t I die now—this very minute—when I am so happy!” thought\nValancy.Well, it couldn’t be so very long now. Somehow, Valancy had always felt\nshe would live out the year Dr. Trent had allotted. She had not been\ncareful—she had never tried to be. But, somehow, she had always counted\non living out her year. She had not let herself think about it at all.\nBut now, sitting here beside Barney, with her hand in his, a sudden\nrealisation came to her. She had not had a heart attack for a long\nwhile—two months at least. The last one she had had was two or three\nnights before Barney was out in the storm. Since then she had not\nremembered she had a heart. Well, no doubt, it betokened the nearness\nof the end. Nature had given up the struggle. There would be no more\npain.“I’m afraid heaven will be very dull after this past year,” thought\nValancy. “But perhaps one will not remember. Would that be—nice? No,\nno. I don’t want to forget Barney. I’d rather be miserable in heaven\nremembering him than happy forgetting him. And I’ll always remember\nthrough all eternity—that he really, _really_ liked me.”CHAPTER XXXVThirty seconds can be very long sometimes. Long enough to work a\nmiracle or a revolution. In thirty seconds life changed wholly for\nBarney and Valancy Snaith."

  "content": "They had gone around the lake one June evening in their disappearing\npropeller, fished for an hour in a little creek, left their boat there,\nand walked up through the woods to Port Lawrence two miles away.\nValancy prowled a bit in the shops and got herself a new pair of\nsensible shoes. Her old pair had suddenly and completely given out, and\nthis evening she had been compelled to put on the little fancy pair of\npatent-leather with rather high, slender heels, which she had bought in\na fit of folly one day in the winter because of their beauty and\nbecause she wanted to make one foolish, extravagant purchase in her\nlife. She sometimes put them on of an evening in the Blue Castle, but\nthis was the first time she had worn them outside. She had not found it\nany too easy walking up through the woods in them, and Barney guyed her\nunmercifully about them. But in spite of the inconvenience, Valancy\nsecretly rather liked the look of her trim ankles and high instep above\nthose pretty, foolish shoes and did not change them in the shop as she\nmight have done.The sun was hanging low above the pines when they left Port Lawrence.\nTo the north of it the woods closed around the town quite suddenly.\nValancy always had a sense of stepping from one world to another—from\nreality to fairyland—when she went out of Port Lawrence and in a\ntwinkling found it shut off behind her by the armies of the pines.A mile and a half from Port Lawrence there was a small railroad station\nwith a little station-house which at this hour of the day was deserted,\nsince no local train was due. Not a soul was in sight when Barney and\nValancy emerged from the woods. Off to the left a sudden curve in the\ntrack hid it from view, but over the tree-tops beyond, the long plume\nof smoke betokened the approach of a through train. The rails were\nvibrating to its thunder as Barney stepped across the switch. Valancy\nwas a few steps behind him, loitering to gather June-bells along the\nlittle, winding path. But there was plenty of time to get across before\nthe train came. She stepped unconcernedly over the first rail.She could never tell how it happened. The ensuing thirty seconds always\nseemed in her recollection like a chaotic nightmare in which she\nendured the agony of a thousand lifetimes.The heel of her pretty, foolish shoe caught in a crevice of the switch.\nShe could not pull it loose.“Barney—Barney!” she called in alarm.Barney turned—saw her predicament—saw her ashen face—dashed back. He\ntried to pull her clear—he tried to wrench her foot from the prisoning\nhold. In vain. In a moment the train would sweep around the curve—would\nbe on them.“Go—go—quick—you’ll be killed, Barney!” shrieked Valancy, trying to\npush him away.Barney dropped on his knees, ghost-white, frantically tearing at her\nshoe-lace. The knot defied his trembling fingers. He snatched a knife\nfrom his pocket and slashed at it. Valancy still strove blindly to push\nhim away. Her mind was full of the hideous thought that Barney was\ngoing to be killed. She had no thought for her own danger."

  "content": "“Barney—go—go—for God’s sake—go!”“Never!” muttered Barney between his set teeth. He gave one mad wrench\nat the lace. As the train thundered around the curve he sprang up and\ncaught Valancy—dragging her clear, leaving the shoe behind her. The\nwind from the train as it swept by turned to icy cold the streaming\nperspiration on his face.“Thank God!” he breathed.For a moment they stood stupidly staring at each other, two white,\nshaken, wild-eyed creatures. Then they stumbled over to the little seat\nat the end of the station-house and dropped on it. Barney buried his\nface in his hands and said not a word. Valancy sat, staring straight\nahead of her with unseeing eyes at the great pine woods, the stumps of\nthe clearing, the long, gleaming rails. There was only one thought in\nher dazed mind—a thought that seemed to burn it as a shaving of fire\nmight burn her body.Dr. Trent had told her over a year ago that she had a serious form of\nheart-disease—that any excitement might be fatal.If that were so, why was she not dead now? This very minute? She had\njust experienced as much and as terrible excitement as most people\nexperience in a lifetime, crowded into that endless thirty seconds. Yet\nshe had not died of it. She was not an iota the worse for it. A little\nwobbly at the knees, as any one would have been; a quicker heart-beat,\nas any one would have; nothing more.Why!_Was it possible Dr. Trent had made a mistake?_"

  "content": "Valancy shivered as if a cold wind had suddenly chilled her to the\nsoul. She looked at Barney, hunched up beside her. His silence was very\neloquent. Had the same thought occurred to him? Did he suddenly find\nhimself confronted by the appalling suspicion that he was married, not\nfor a few months or a year, but for good and all to a woman he did not\nlove and who had foisted herself upon him by some trick or lie? Valancy\nturned sick before the horror of it. It could not be. It would be too\ncruel—too devilish. Dr. Trent _couldn’t_ have made a mistake.\nImpossible. He was one of the best heart specialists in Ontario. She\nwas foolish—unnerved by the recent horror. She remembered some of the\nhideous spasms of pain she had had. There must be something serious the\nmatter with her heart to account for them.But she had not had any for nearly three months.Why?Presently Barney bestirred himself. He stood up, without looking at\nValancy, and said casually:“I suppose we’d better be hiking back. Sun’s getting low. Are you good\nfor the rest of the road?”“I think so,” said Valancy miserably.Barney went across the clearing and picked up the parcel he had\ndropped—the parcel containing her new shoes. He brought it to her and\nlet her take out the shoes and put them on without any assistance,\nwhile he stood with his back to her and looked out over the pines.They walked in silence down the shadowy trail to the lake. In silence\nBarney steered his boat into the sunset miracle that was Mistawis. In\nsilence they went around feathery headlands and across coral bays and\nsilver rivers where canoes were slipping up and down in the afterglow.\nIn silence they went past cottages echoing with music and laughter. In\nsilence drew up at the landing-place below the Blue Castle.Valancy went up the rock steps and into the house. She dropped\nmiserably on the first chair she came to and sat there staring through\nthe oriel, oblivious of Good Luck’s frantic purrs of joy and Banjo’s\nsavage glares of protest at her occupancy of his chair.Barney came in a few minutes later. He did not come near her, but he\nstood behind her and asked gently if she felt any the worse for her\nexperience. Valancy would have given her year of happiness to have been\nable honestly to answer “Yes.”“No,” she said flatly.Barney went into Bluebeard’s Chamber and shut the door. She heard him\npacing up and down—up and down. He had never paced like that before.And an hour ago—only an hour ago—she had been so happy!CHAPTER XXXVI"

Not the writing of a man who didn’t know what he\nwas writing about. But she could not sleep. She pretended to be asleep\nwhen Barney came in. Barney pretended to go to sleep. But Valancy knew\nperfectly well he wasn’t sleeping any more than she was. She knew he\nwas lying there, staring through the darkness. Thinking of what? Trying\nto face—what?Valancy, who had spent so many happy wakeful hours of night lying by\nthat window, now paid the price of them all in this one night of\nmisery. A horrible, portentous fact was slowly looming out before her\nfrom the nebula of surmise and fear. She could not shut her eyes to\nit—push it away—ignore it.There could be nothing seriously wrong with her heart, no matter what\nDr. Trent had said. If there had been, those thirty seconds would have\nkilled her. It was no use to recall Dr. Trent’s letter and reputation.\nThe greatest specialists made mistakes sometimes. Dr. Trent had made\none.Towards morning Valancy fell into a fitful dose with ridiculous dreams.\nOne of them was of Barney taunting her with having tricked him. In her\ndream she lost her temper and struck him violently on the head with her\nrolling-pin. He proved to be made of glass and shivered into splinters\nall over the floor. She woke with a cry of horror—a gasp of relief—a\nshort laugh over the absurdity of her dream—a miserable sickening\nrecollection of what had happened.Barney was gone. Valancy knew, as people sometimes know\nthings—inescapably, without being told—that he was not in the house or\nin Bluebeard’s Chamber either. There was a curious silence in the\nliving-room. A silence with something uncanny about it. The old clock\nhad stopped. Barney must have forgotten to wind it up, something he had\nnever done before. The room without it was dead, though the sunshine\nstreamed in through the oriel and dimples of light from the dancing\nwaves beyond quivered over the walls."

Yet the curious numbness that pervaded her being was in a\nway worse than pain. It was as if something in her had died. She forced\nherself to cook and eat a little breakfast.

I wanted to consult you about\nmy heart.”Dr. Trent’s face cleared.“Oh, of course. I remember now. I’m really not to blame for not knowing\nyou. You’ve changed—splendidly. And married. Well, well, it has agreed\nwith you. You don’t look much like an invalid now, hey? I remember that\nday. I was badly upset. Hearing about poor Ned bowled me over. But\nNed’s as good as new and you, too, evidently. I told you so, you\nknow—told you there was nothing to worry over.”Valancy looked at him.“You told me, in your letter,” she said slowly, with a curious feeling\nthat some one else was talking through her lips, “that I had angina\npectoris—in the last stages—complicated with an aneurism. That I might\ndie any minute—that I couldn’t live longer than a year.”Dr. Trent stared at her.“Impossible!” he said blankly. “I couldn’t have told you that!”Valancy took his letter from her bag and handed it to him.“Miss Valancy Stirling,” he read. “Yes—yes. Of course I wrote you—on\nthe train—that night. But I _told_ you there was nothing serious——”“Read your letter,” insisted Valancy.Dr. Trent took it out—unfolded it—glanced over it. A dismayed look came\ninto his face. He jumped to his feet and strode agitatedly about the\nroom.“Good heavens! This is the letter I meant for old Miss Jane Sterling.\nFrom Port Lawrence. She was here that day, too. I sent you the wrong\nletter. What unpardonable carelessness! But I was beside myself that\nnight. My God, and you believed that—you believed—but you didn’t—you\nwent to another doctor——”Valancy stood up, turned round, looked foolishly about her and sat down\nagain.“I believed it,” she said faintly. “I didn’t go to any other doctor.\nI—I—it would take too long to explain.

It’s\nnever fatal—passes away completely with proper treatment. Or sometimes\nwith a shock of joy. Have you been troubled much with it?”“Not at all since March,” answered Valancy.

Nothing that she could have done or\nleft undone could have made any difference. I was surprised she lived\nas long as she did—two months. She was here that day—not long before\nyou.

If to feel was to live she was living\nwith a vengeance.She let Dr. Trent examine her and answered all his questions. When he\ntold her she was fit as a fiddle and would probably live to be a\nhundred, she got up and went away silently. She knew that there were a\ngreat many horrible things outside waiting to be thought over. Dr.\nTrent thought she was odd. Anybody would have thought, from her\nhopeless eyes and woebegone face, that he had given her a sentence of\ndeath instead of life. Snaith? Snaith? Who the devil had she married?\nHe had never heard of Snaiths in Deerwood. And she had been such a\nsallow, faded, little old maid. Gad, but marriage _had_ made a\ndifference in her, anyhow, whoever Snaith was. Snaith? Dr. Trent\nremembered. That rapscallion “up back!” Had Valancy Stirling married\n_him_? And her clan had let her! Well, probably that solved the\nmystery. She had married in haste and repented at leisure, and that was\nwhy she wasn’t overjoyed at learning she was a good insurance prospect,\nafter all. Married! To God knew whom! Or what! Jail-bird? Defaulter?\nFugitive from justice? It must be pretty bad if she had looked to death\nas a release, poor girl. But why were women such fools? Dr. Trent\ndismissed Valancy from his mind, though to the day of his death he was\nashamed of putting those letters into the wrong envelopes.CHAPTER XXXVIII"

  "content": "Valancy walked quickly through the back streets and through Lover’s\nLane. She did not want to meet any one she knew. She didn’t want to\nmeet even people she didn’t know. She hated to be seen. Her mind was so\nconfused, so torn, so messy. She felt that her appearance must be the\nsame. She drew a sobbing breath of relief as she left the village\nbehind and found herself on the “up back” road. There was little fear\nof meeting any one she knew here. The cars that fled by her with\nraucous shrieks were filled with strangers. One of them was packed with\nyoung people who whirled past her singing uproariously:“My wife has the fever, O then,\nMy wife has the fever, O then,\nMy wife has the fever,\nOh, I hope it won’t leave her,\nFor I want to be single again.”Valancy flinched as if one of them had leaned from the car and cut her\nacross the face with a whip.She had made a covenant with death and death had cheated her. Now life\nstood mocking her. She had trapped Barney. Trapped him into marrying\nher. And divorce was so hard to get in Ontario. So expensive. And\nBarney was poor.With life, fear had come back into her heart. Sickening fear. Fear of\nwhat Barney would think. Would say. Fear of the future that must be\nlived without him. Fear of her insulted, repudiated clan.She had had one draught from a divine cup and now it was dashed from\nher lips. With no kind, friendly death to rescue her. She must go on\nliving and longing for it. Everything was spoiled, smirched, defaced.\nEven that year in the Blue Castle. Even her unashamed love for Barney.\nIt had been beautiful because death waited. Now it was only sordid\nbecause death was gone. How could any one bear an unbearable thing?She must go back and tell him. Make him believe she had not meant to\ntrick him—she _must_ make him believe that. She must say good-bye to\nher Blue Castle and return to the brick house on Elm Street. Back to\neverything she had thought left behind forever. The old bondage—the old\nfears. But that did not matter. All that mattered now was that Barney\nmust somehow be made to believe she had not consciously tricked him."

  "content": "When Valancy reached the pines by the lake she was brought out of her\ndaze of pain by a startling sight. There, parked by the side of old,\nbattered ragged Lady Jane, was another car. A wonderful car. A purple\ncar. Not a dark, royal purple but a blatant, screaming purple. It shone\nlike a mirror and its interior plainly indicated the car caste of Vere\nde Vere. On the driver’s seat sat a haughty chauffeur in livery. And in\nthe tonneau sat a man who opened the door and bounced out nimbly as\nValancy came down the path to the landing-place. He stood under the\npines waiting for her and Valancy took in every detail of him.A stout, short, pudgy man, with a broad, rubicund, good-humoured face—a\nclean-shaven face, though an unparalysed little imp at the back of\nValancy’s paralysed mind suggested the thought, “Such a face should\nhave a fringe of white whisker around it.” Old-fashioned, steel-rimmed\nspectacles on prominent blue eyes. A pursey mouth; a little round,\nknobby nose. Where—where—where, groped Valancy, had she seen that face\nbefore? It seemed as familiar to her as her own.The stranger wore a green hat and a light fawn overcoat over a suit of\na loud check pattern. His tie was a brilliant green of lighter shade;\non the plump hand he outstretched to intercept Valancy an enormous\ndiamond winked at her. But he had a pleasant, fatherly smile, and in\nhis hearty, unmodulated voice was a ring of something that attracted\nher.“Can you tell me, Miss, if that house yonder belongs to a Mr. Redfern?\nAnd if so, how can I get to it?”Redfern! A vision of bottles seemed to dance before Valancy’s eyes—long\nbottles of bitters—round bottles of hair tonic—square bottles of\nliniment—short, corpulent little bottles of purple pills—and all of\nthem bearing that very prosperous, beaming moon-face and steel-rimmed\nspectacles on the label.Dr. Redfern!“No,” said Valancy faintly. “No—that house belongs to Mr. Snaith.”Dr. Redfern nodded.“Yes, I understand Bernie’s been calling himself Snaith. Well, it’s his\nmiddle name—was his poor mother’s. Bernard Snaith Redfern—that’s him.\nAnd now, Miss, you can tell me how to get over to that island? Nobody\nseems to be home there. I’ve done some waving and yelling. Henry,\nthere, wouldn’t yell. He’s a one-job man. But old Doc Redfern can yell\nwith the best of them yet, and ain’t above doing it. Raised nothing but\na couple of crows. Guess Bernie’s out for the day.”“He was away when I left this morning,” said Valancy. “I suppose he\nhasn’t come home yet.”"

  "content": "She spoke flatly and tonelessly. This last shock had temporarily bereft\nher of whatever little power of reasoning had been left her by Dr.\nTrent’s revelation. In the back of her mind the aforesaid little imp\nwas jeeringly repeating a silly old proverb, “It never rains but it\npours.” But she was not trying to think. What was the use?Dr. Redfern was gazing at her in perplexity.“When you left this morning? Do you live—over there?”He waved his diamond at the Blue Castle.“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly. “I’m his wife.”Dr. Redfern took out a yellow silk handkerchief, removed his hat and\nmopped his brow. He was very bald, and Valancy’s imp whispered, “Why be\nbald? Why lose your manly beauty? Try Redfern’s Hair Vigor. It keeps\nyou young.”“Excuse me,” said Dr. Redfern. “This is a bit of a shock.”“Shocks seem to be in the air this morning.” The imp said this out loud\nbefore Valancy could prevent it.“I didn’t know Bernie was—married. I didn’t think he _would_ have got\nmarried without telling his old dad.”Were Dr. Redfern’s eyes misty? Amid her own dull ache of misery and\nfear and dread, Valancy felt a pang of pity for him.“Don’t blame him,” she said hurriedly. “It—it wasn’t his fault. It—was\nall my doing.”“You didn’t ask him to marry you, I suppose,” twinkled Dr. Redfern. “He\nmight have let me know. I’d have got acquainted with my daughter-in-law\nbefore this if he had. But I’m glad to meet you now, my dear—very glad.\nYou look like a sensible young woman. I used to sorter fear Barney’d\npick out some pretty bit of fluff just because she was good-looking.\nThey were all after him, of course. Wanted his money? Eh? Didn’t like\nthe pills and the bitters but liked the dollars. Eh? Wanted to dip\ntheir pretty little fingers in old Doc’s millions. Eh?”“Millions!” said Valancy faintly. She wished she could sit down\nsomewhere—she wished she could have a chance to think—she wished she\nand the Blue Castle could sink to the bottom of Mistawis and vanish\nfrom human sight forevermore."

  "content": "“Millions,” said Dr. Redfern complacently. “And Bernie chucks them\nfor—that.” Again he shook the diamond contemptuously at the Blue\nCastle. “Wouldn’t you think he’d have more sense? And all on account of\na white bit of a girl. He must have got over _that_ feeling, anyhow,\nsince he’s married. You must persuade him to come back to civilisation.\nAll nonsense wasting his life like this. Ain’t you going to take me\nover to your house, my dear? I suppose you’ve some way of getting\nthere.”“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly. She led the way down to the little\ncove where the disappearing propeller boat was snuggled.“Does your—your man want to come, too?”“Who? Henry. Not he. Look at him sitting there disapproving.\nDisapproves of the whole expedition. The trail up from the road nearly\ngave him a conniption. Well, it _was_ a devilish road to put a car on.\nWhose old bus is that up there?”“Barney’s.”“Good Lord! Does Bernie Redfern ride in a thing like that? It looks\nlike the great-great-grand-mother of all the Fords.”“It isn’t a Ford. It’s a Grey Slosson,” said Valancy spiritedly. For\nsome occult reason, Dr. Redfern’s good-humoured ridicule of dear old\nLady Jane stung her to life. A life that was all pain but still _life_.\nBetter than the horrible half-dead-and-half-aliveness of the past few\nminutes—or years. She waved Dr. Redfern curtly into the boat and took\nhim over to the Blue Castle. The key was still in the old pine—the\nhouse still silent and deserted. Valancy took the doctor through the\nliving-room to the western verandah. She must at least be out where\nthere was air. It was still sunny, but in the southwest a great\nthundercloud, with white crests and gorges of purple shadow, was slowly\nrising over Mistawis. The doctor dropped with a gasp on a rustic chair\nand mopped his brow again.“Warm, eh? Lord, what a view! Wonder if it would soften Henry if he\ncould see it.”“Have you had dinner?” asked Valancy.“Yes, my dear—had it before we left Port Lawrence. Didn’t know what\nsort of wild hermit’s hollow we were coming to, you see. Hadn’t any\nidea I was going to find a nice little daughter-in-law here all ready\nto toss me up a meal. Cats, eh? Puss, puss! See that. Cats love me.\nBernie was always fond of cats! It’s about the only thing he took from\nme. He’s his poor mother’s boy.”Valancy had been thinking idly that Barney must resemble his mother.\nShe had remained standing by the steps, but Dr. Redfern waved her to\nthe swing seat."

No beauty—you\ndon’t mind my saying that—you’ve sense enough to know it, I reckon. Sit\ndown.”Valancy sat down. To be obliged to sit still when mental agony urges us\nto stride up and down is the refinement of torture. Every nerve in her\nbeing was crying out to be alone—to be hidden. But she had to sit and\nlisten to Dr. Redfern, who didn’t mind talking at all.“When do you think Bernie will be back?”“I don’t know—not before night probably.”“Where did he go?”“I don’t know that either. Likely to the woods—up back.”“So he doesn’t tell you his comings and goings, either? Bernie was\nalways a secretive young devil. Never understood him. Just like his\npoor mother. But I thought a lot of him. It hurt me when he disappeared\nas he did. Eleven years ago. I haven’t seen my boy for eleven years.”“Eleven years.” Valancy was surprised. “It’s only six since he came\nhere.”“Oh, he was in the Klondike before that—and all over the world. He used\nto drop me a line now and then—never give any clue to where he was but\njust a line to say he was all right. I s’pose he’s told you all about\nit.”“No. I know nothing of his past life,” said Valancy with sudden\neagerness. She wanted to know—she must know now. It hadn’t mattered\nbefore. Now she must know all. And she could never hear it from Barney.\nShe might never even see him again. If she did, it would not be to talk\nof his past.“What happened? Why did he leave his home? Tell me. Tell me.”"

You never could make that boy do anything he didn’t want to\ndo. From the day he was born. Yet he was always a quiet, gentle little\nchap, too. Good as gold. His poor mother died when he was only two\nyears old. I’d just begun to make money with my Hair Vigor. I’d dreamed\nthe formula for it, you see. Some dream that. The cash rolled in.\nBernie had everything he wanted. I sent him to the best schools—private\nschools. I meant to make a gentleman of him. Never had any chance\nmyself. Meant he should have every chance. He went through McGill. Got\nhonours and all that. I wanted him to go in for law. He hankered after\njournalism and stuff like that. Wanted me to buy a paper for him—or\nback him in publishing what he called a ‘real, worthwhile,\nhonest-to-goodness Canadian Magazine.’ I s’pose I’d have done it—I\nalways did what he wanted me to do. Wasn’t he all I had to live for? I\nwanted him to be happy. And he never was happy. Can you believe it? Not\nthat he said so. But I’d always a feeling that he wasn’t happy.\nEverything he wanted—all the money he could spend—his own bank\naccount—travel—seeing the world—but he wasn’t happy. Not till he fell\nin love with Ethel Traverse. Then he was happy for a little while.”The cloud had reached the sun and a great, chill, purple shadow came\nswiftly over Mistawis. It touched the Blue Castle—rolled over it.\nValancy shivered.“Yes,” she said, with painful eagerness, though every word was cutting\nher to the heart. “What—was—she—like?”“Prettiest girl in Montreal,” said Dr. Redfern. “Oh, she was a looker,\nall right. Eh? Gold hair—shiny as silk—great, big, soft, black\neyes—skin like milk and roses. Don’t wonder Bernie fell for her. And\nbrains as well. _She_ wasn’t a bit of fluff. B. A. from McGill. A\nthoroughbred, too. One of the best families. But a bit lean in the\npurse. Eh! Bernie was mad about her. Happiest young fool you ever saw.\nThen—the bust-up.”“What happened?” Valancy had taken off her hat and was absently\nthrusting a pin in and out of it. Good Luck was purring beside her.\nBanjo was regarding Dr. Redfern with suspicion. Nip and Tuck were\nlazily cawing in the pines. Mistawis was beckoning. Everything was the\nsame. Nothing was the same. It was a hundred years since yesterday.\nYesterday, at this time, she and Barney had been eating a belated\ndinner here with laughter. Laughter? Valancy felt that she had done\nwith laughter forever. And with tears, for that matter. She had no\nfurther use for either of them.“Blest if I know, my dear. Some fool quarrel, I suppose. Bernie just\nlit out—disappeared. He wrote me from the Yukon. Said his engagement\nwas broken and he wasn’t coming back. And not to try to hunt him up\nbecause he was never coming back. I didn’t. What was the use? I knew\nBernie. I went on piling, up money because there wasn’t anything else\nto do. But I was mighty lonely. All I lived for was them little notes\nnow and then from Bernie—Klondike—England—South\nAfrica—China—everywhere. I thought maybe he’d come back some day to his\nlonesome old dad. Then six years ago even the letters stopped. I didn’t\nhear a word of or from him till last Christmas.”“Did he write?”"

He’d always promised me he’d let me know if Bernie drew\nany checks. Bernie had fifty thousand there. And he’d never touched a\ncent of it till last Christmas. The check was made out to Aynsley’s,\nToronto——”“Aynsley’s?” Valancy heard herself saying Aynsley’s! She had a box on\nher dressing-table with the Aynsley trademark.“Yes. The big jewellery house there. After I’d thought it over a while,\nI got brisk. I wanted to locate Bernie. Had a special reason for it. It\nwas time he gave up his fool hoboing and come to his senses. Drawing\nthat fifteen told me there was something in the wind. The manager\ncommunicated with the Aynsleys—his wife was an Aynsley—and found out\nthat Bernard Redfern had bought a pearl necklace there. His address was\ngiven as Box 444, Port Lawrence, Muskoka, Ont. First I thought I’d\nwrite. Then I thought I’d wait till the open season for cars and come\ndown myself. Ain’t no hand at writing. I’ve motored from Montreal. Got\nto Port Lawrence yesterday. Enquired at the post-office. Told me they\nknew nothing of any Bernard Snaith Redfern, but there was a Barney\nSnaith had a P. O. box there. Lived on an island out here, they said.\nSo here I am. And where’s Barney?”Valancy was fingering her necklace. She was wearing fifteen thousand\ndollars around her neck. And she had worried lest Barney had paid\nfifteen dollars for it and couldn’t afford it. Suddenly she laughed in\nDr. Redfern’s face.“Excuse me. It’s so—amusing,” said poor Valancy.“Isn’t it?” said Dr. Redfern, seeing a joke—but not exactly hers. “Now,\nyou seem like a sensible young woman, and I dare say you’ve lots of\ninfluence over Bernie. Can’t you get him to come back to civilisation\nand live like other people? I’ve a house up there. Big as a castle.\nFurnished like a palace.
