  "content": "“Allan Tierney never makes a mistake,” said Barney. “You forget,\nMoonlight, that there are different kinds of beauty. Your imagination\nis obsessed by the very obvious type of your cousin Olive. Oh, I’ve\nseen her—she’s a stunner—but you’d never catch Allan Tierney wanting to\npaint her. In the horrible but expressive slang phrase, she keeps all\nher goods in the shop-window. But in your subconscious mind you have a\nconviction that nobody can be beautiful who doesn’t look like Olive.\nAlso, you remember your face as it was in the days when your soul was\nnot allowed to shine through it. Tierney said something about the curve\nof your cheek as you looked back over your shoulder. You know I’ve\noften told you it was distracting. And he’s quite batty about your\neyes. If I wasn’t absolutely sure it was solely professional—he’s\nreally a crabbed old bachelor, you know—I’d be jealous.”“Well, I don’t want to be painted,” said Valancy. “I hope you told him\nthat.”“I couldn’t tell him that. I didn’t know what _you_ wanted. But I told\nhim _I_ didn’t want my wife painted—hung up in a salon for the mob to\nstare at. Belonging to another man. For of course I couldn’t buy the\npicture. So even if you had wanted to be painted, Moonlight, your\ntyrannous husband would not have permitted it. Tierney was a bit\nsquiffy. He isn’t used to being turned down like that. His requests are\nalmost like royalty’s.”“But we are outlaws,” laughed Valancy. “We bow to no decrees—we\nacknowledge no sovereignty.”In her heart she thought unashamedly:“I wish Olive could know that Allan Tierney wanted to paint me. _Me_!\nLittle-old-maid-Valancy-Stirling-that-was.”Her second wonder-moment came one evening in May. She realised that\nBarney actually liked her. She had always hoped he did, but sometimes\nshe had a little, disagreeable, haunting dread that he was just kind\nand nice and chummy out of pity; knowing that she hadn’t long to live\nand determined she should have a good time as long as she did live; but\naway back in his mind rather looking forward to freedom again, with no\nintrusive woman creature in his island fastness and no chattering thing\nbeside him in his woodland prowls. She knew he could never love her.\nShe did not even want him to. If he loved her he would be unhappy when\nshe died—Valancy never flinched from the plain word. No “passing away”\nfor her. And she did not want him to be the least unhappy. But neither\ndid she want him to be glad—or relieved. She wanted him to like her and\nmiss her as a good chum. But she had never been sure until this night\nthat he did."

They had the delight of\ndiscovering a virgin spring in a ferny hollow and had drunk together\nfrom it out of a birch-bark cup; they had come to an old tumble-down\nrail fence and sat on it for a long time. They didn’t talk much, but\nValancy had a curious sense of _oneness_. She knew that she couldn’t\nhave felt that if he hadn’t liked her.“You nice little thing,” said Barney suddenly. “Oh, you nice little\nthing! Sometimes I feel you’re too nice to be real—that I’m just\ndreaming you.”“Why can’t I die now—this very minute—when I am so happy!” thought\nValancy.Well, it couldn’t be so very long now. Somehow, Valancy had always felt\nshe would live out the year Dr. Trent had allotted. She had not been\ncareful—she had never tried to be. But, somehow, she had always counted\non living out her year. She had not let herself think about it at all.\nBut now, sitting here beside Barney, with her hand in his, a sudden\nrealisation came to her. She had not had a heart attack for a long\nwhile—two months at least. The last one she had had was two or three\nnights before Barney was out in the storm. Since then she had not\nremembered she had a heart. Well, no doubt, it betokened the nearness\nof the end. Nature had given up the struggle. There would be no more\npain.“I’m afraid heaven will be very dull after this past year,” thought\nValancy. “But perhaps one will not remember. Would that be—nice? No,\nno. I don’t want to forget Barney. I’d rather be miserable in heaven\nremembering him than happy forgetting him. And I’ll always remember\nthrough all eternity—that he really, _really_ liked me.”CHAPTER XXXVThirty seconds can be very long sometimes. Long enough to work a\nmiracle or a revolution. In thirty seconds life changed wholly for\nBarney and Valancy Snaith."

  "content": "They had gone around the lake one June evening in their disappearing\npropeller, fished for an hour in a little creek, left their boat there,\nand walked up through the woods to Port Lawrence two miles away.\nValancy prowled a bit in the shops and got herself a new pair of\nsensible shoes. Her old pair had suddenly and completely given out, and\nthis evening she had been compelled to put on the little fancy pair of\npatent-leather with rather high, slender heels, which she had bought in\na fit of folly one day in the winter because of their beauty and\nbecause she wanted to make one foolish, extravagant purchase in her\nlife. She sometimes put them on of an evening in the Blue Castle, but\nthis was the first time she had worn them outside. She had not found it\nany too easy walking up through the woods in them, and Barney guyed her\nunmercifully about them. But in spite of the inconvenience, Valancy\nsecretly rather liked the look of her trim ankles and high instep above\nthose pretty, foolish shoes and did not change them in the shop as she\nmight have done.The sun was hanging low above the pines when they left Port Lawrence.\nTo the north of it the woods closed around the town quite suddenly.\nValancy always had a sense of stepping from one world to another—from\nreality to fairyland—when she went out of Port Lawrence and in a\ntwinkling found it shut off behind her by the armies of the pines.A mile and a half from Port Lawrence there was a small railroad station\nwith a little station-house which at this hour of the day was deserted,\nsince no local train was due. Not a soul was in sight when Barney and\nValancy emerged from the woods. Off to the left a sudden curve in the\ntrack hid it from view, but over the tree-tops beyond, the long plume\nof smoke betokened the approach of a through train. The rails were\nvibrating to its thunder as Barney stepped across the switch. Valancy\nwas a few steps behind him, loitering to gather June-bells along the\nlittle, winding path. But there was plenty of time to get across before\nthe train came. She stepped unconcernedly over the first rail.She could never tell how it happened. The ensuing thirty seconds always\nseemed in her recollection like a chaotic nightmare in which she\nendured the agony of a thousand lifetimes.The heel of her pretty, foolish shoe caught in a crevice of the switch.\nShe could not pull it loose.“Barney—Barney!” she called in alarm.Barney turned—saw her predicament—saw her ashen face—dashed back. He\ntried to pull her clear—he tried to wrench her foot from the prisoning\nhold. In vain. In a moment the train would sweep around the curve—would\nbe on them.“Go—go—quick—you’ll be killed, Barney!” shrieked Valancy, trying to\npush him away.Barney dropped on his knees, ghost-white, frantically tearing at her\nshoe-lace. The knot defied his trembling fingers. He snatched a knife\nfrom his pocket and slashed at it. Valancy still strove blindly to push\nhim away. Her mind was full of the hideous thought that Barney was\ngoing to be killed. She had no thought for her own danger."

  "content": "“Barney—go—go—for God’s sake—go!”“Never!” muttered Barney between his set teeth. He gave one mad wrench\nat the lace. As the train thundered around the curve he sprang up and\ncaught Valancy—dragging her clear, leaving the shoe behind her. The\nwind from the train as it swept by turned to icy cold the streaming\nperspiration on his face.“Thank God!” he breathed.For a moment they stood stupidly staring at each other, two white,\nshaken, wild-eyed creatures. Then they stumbled over to the little seat\nat the end of the station-house and dropped on it. Barney buried his\nface in his hands and said not a word. Valancy sat, staring straight\nahead of her with unseeing eyes at the great pine woods, the stumps of\nthe clearing, the long, gleaming rails. There was only one thought in\nher dazed mind—a thought that seemed to burn it as a shaving of fire\nmight burn her body.Dr. Trent had told her over a year ago that she had a serious form of\nheart-disease—that any excitement might be fatal.If that were so, why was she not dead now? This very minute? She had\njust experienced as much and as terrible excitement as most people\nexperience in a lifetime, crowded into that endless thirty seconds. Yet\nshe had not died of it. She was not an iota the worse for it. A little\nwobbly at the knees, as any one would have been; a quicker heart-beat,\nas any one would have; nothing more.Why!_Was it possible Dr. Trent had made a mistake?_"

  "content": "Valancy shivered as if a cold wind had suddenly chilled her to the\nsoul. She looked at Barney, hunched up beside her. His silence was very\neloquent. Had the same thought occurred to him? Did he suddenly find\nhimself confronted by the appalling suspicion that he was married, not\nfor a few months or a year, but for good and all to a woman he did not\nlove and who had foisted herself upon him by some trick or lie? Valancy\nturned sick before the horror of it. It could not be. It would be too\ncruel—too devilish. Dr. Trent _couldn’t_ have made a mistake.\nImpossible. He was one of the best heart specialists in Ontario. She\nwas foolish—unnerved by the recent horror. She remembered some of the\nhideous spasms of pain she had had. There must be something serious the\nmatter with her heart to account for them.But she had not had any for nearly three months.Why?Presently Barney bestirred himself. He stood up, without looking at\nValancy, and said casually:“I suppose we’d better be hiking back. Sun’s getting low. Are you good\nfor the rest of the road?”“I think so,” said Valancy miserably.Barney went across the clearing and picked up the parcel he had\ndropped—the parcel containing her new shoes. He brought it to her and\nlet her take out the shoes and put them on without any assistance,\nwhile he stood with his back to her and looked out over the pines.They walked in silence down the shadowy trail to the lake. In silence\nBarney steered his boat into the sunset miracle that was Mistawis. In\nsilence they went around feathery headlands and across coral bays and\nsilver rivers where canoes were slipping up and down in the afterglow.\nIn silence they went past cottages echoing with music and laughter. In\nsilence drew up at the landing-place below the Blue Castle.Valancy went up the rock steps and into the house. She dropped\nmiserably on the first chair she came to and sat there staring through\nthe oriel, oblivious of Good Luck’s frantic purrs of joy and Banjo’s\nsavage glares of protest at her occupancy of his chair.Barney came in a few minutes later. He did not come near her, but he\nstood behind her and asked gently if she felt any the worse for her\nexperience. Valancy would have given her year of happiness to have been\nable honestly to answer “Yes.”“No,” she said flatly.Barney went into Bluebeard’s Chamber and shut the door. She heard him\npacing up and down—up and down. He had never paced like that before.And an hour ago—only an hour ago—she had been so happy!CHAPTER XXXVI"

  "content": "Finally Valancy went to bed. Before she went she re-read Dr. Trent’s\nletter. It comforted her a little. So positive. So assured. The writing\nso black and steady. Not the writing of a man who didn’t know what he\nwas writing about. But she could not sleep. She pretended to be asleep\nwhen Barney came in. Barney pretended to go to sleep. But Valancy knew\nperfectly well he wasn’t sleeping any more than she was. She knew he\nwas lying there, staring through the darkness. Thinking of what? Trying\nto face—what?Valancy, who had spent so many happy wakeful hours of night lying by\nthat window, now paid the price of them all in this one night of\nmisery. A horrible, portentous fact was slowly looming out before her\nfrom the nebula of surmise and fear. She could not shut her eyes to\nit—push it away—ignore it.There could be nothing seriously wrong with her heart, no matter what\nDr. Trent had said. If there had been, those thirty seconds would have\nkilled her. It was no use to recall Dr. Trent’s letter and reputation.\nThe greatest specialists made mistakes sometimes. Dr. Trent had made\none.Towards morning Valancy fell into a fitful dose with ridiculous dreams.\nOne of them was of Barney taunting her with having tricked him. In her\ndream she lost her temper and struck him violently on the head with her\nrolling-pin. He proved to be made of glass and shivered into splinters\nall over the floor. She woke with a cry of horror—a gasp of relief—a\nshort laugh over the absurdity of her dream—a miserable sickening\nrecollection of what had happened.Barney was gone. Valancy knew, as people sometimes know\nthings—inescapably, without being told—that he was not in the house or\nin Bluebeard’s Chamber either. There was a curious silence in the\nliving-room. A silence with something uncanny about it. The old clock\nhad stopped. Barney must have forgotten to wind it up, something he had\nnever done before. The room without it was dead, though the sunshine\nstreamed in through the oriel and dimples of light from the dancing\nwaves beyond quivered over the walls."

He must be angry with her. That furious\nsilence of his must mean anger—cold, deep, justifiable resentment.\nWell, Valancy knew what she must do first. She was not suffering very\nkeenly now. Yet the curious numbness that pervaded her being was in a\nway worse than pain. It was as if something in her had died. She forced\nherself to cook and eat a little breakfast. Mechanically she put the\nBlue Castle in perfect order. Then she put on her hat and coat, locked\nthe door and hid the key in the hollow of the old pine and crossed to\nthe mainland in the motor boat. She was going into Deerwood to see Dr.\nTrent. She must _know_.CHAPTER XXXVIIDr. Trent looked at her blankly and fumbled among his recollections.“Er—Miss—Miss—”“Mrs. Snaith,” said Valancy quietly. “I was Miss Valancy Stirling when\nI came to you last May—over a year ago. I wanted to consult you about\nmy heart.”Dr. Trent’s face cleared.“Oh, of course. I remember now. I’m really not to blame for not knowing\nyou. You’ve changed—splendidly. And married. Well, well, it has agreed\nwith you. You don’t look much like an invalid now, hey? I remember that\nday. I was badly upset. Hearing about poor Ned bowled me over. But\nNed’s as good as new and you, too, evidently. I told you so, you\nknow—told you there was nothing to worry over.”Valancy looked at him.“You told me, in your letter,” she said slowly, with a curious feeling\nthat some one else was talking through her lips, “that I had angina\npectoris—in the last stages—complicated with an aneurism. That I might\ndie any minute—that I couldn’t live longer than a year.”Dr. Trent stared at her.“Impossible!” he said blankly. “I couldn’t have told you that!”Valancy took his letter from her bag and handed it to him.“Miss Valancy Stirling,” he read. “Yes—yes. Of course I wrote you—on\nthe train—that night. But I _told_ you there was nothing serious——”“Read your letter,” insisted Valancy.Dr. Trent took it out—unfolded it—glanced over it. A dismayed look came\ninto his face. He jumped to his feet and strode agitatedly about the\nroom.“Good heavens! This is the letter I meant for old Miss Jane Sterling.\nFrom Port Lawrence. She was here that day, too. I sent you the wrong\nletter. What unpardonable carelessness! But I was beside myself that\nnight. My God, and you believed that—you believed—but you didn’t—you\nwent to another doctor——”Valancy stood up, turned round, looked foolishly about her and sat down\nagain.“I believed it,” she said faintly. “I didn’t go to any other doctor.\nI—I—it would take too long to explain. But I believed I was going to\ndie soon.”Dr. Trent halted before her."

But you\ndon’t look—I can’t understand!”“Never mind,” said Valancy dully. “And so there’s nothing the matter\nwith my heart?”“Well, nothing serious. You had what is called pseudo-angina. It’s\nnever fatal—passes away completely with proper treatment. Or sometimes\nwith a shock of joy. Have you been troubled much with it?”“Not at all since March,” answered Valancy. She remembered the\nmarvellous feeling of re-creation she had had when she saw Barney\ncoming home safe after the storm. Had that “shock of joy” cured her?“Then likely you’re all right. I told you what to do in the letter you\nshould have got. _And_ of course I supposed you’d go to another doctor.\nChild, why didn’t you?”“I didn’t want anybody to know.”“Idiot,” said Dr. Trent bluntly. “I can’t understand such folly. And\npoor old Miss Sterling. She must have got your letter—telling her there\nwas nothing serious the matter. Well, well, it couldn’t have made any\ndifference. Her case was hopeless. Nothing that she could have done or\nleft undone could have made any difference. I was surprised she lived\nas long as she did—two months. She was here that day—not long before\nyou. I hated to tell her the truth. You think I’m a blunt old\ncurmudgeon—and my letters _are_ blunt enough. I can’t soften things.\nBut I’m a snivelling coward when it comes to telling a woman face to\nface that she’s got to die soon. I told her I’d look up some features\nof the case I wasn’t quite sure of and let her know next day. But you\ngot her letter—look here, ‘Dear Miss S-t-_e_-r-l-i-n-g.’”“Yes. I noticed that.

It’s time I\nretired, all right, when I do things like that—even if my son was\nsupposed to be fatally injured. Can you ever forgive me?”A year of misery! Valancy smiled a tortured smile as she thought of all\nthe happiness Dr. Trent’s mistake had bought her. But she was paying\nfor it now—oh, she was paying. If to feel was to live she was living\nwith a vengeance.She let Dr. Trent examine her and answered all his questions. When he\ntold her she was fit as a fiddle and would probably live to be a\nhundred, she got up and went away silently. She knew that there were a\ngreat many horrible things outside waiting to be thought over. Dr.\nTrent thought she was odd. Anybody would have thought, from her\nhopeless eyes and woebegone face, that he had given her a sentence of\ndeath instead of life. Snaith? Snaith? Who the devil had she married?\nHe had never heard of Snaiths in Deerwood. And she had been such a\nsallow, faded, little old maid. Gad, but marriage _had_ made a\ndifference in her, anyhow, whoever Snaith was. Snaith? Dr. Trent\nremembered. That rapscallion “up back!” Had Valancy Stirling married\n_him_? And her clan had let her! Well, probably that solved the\nmystery. She had married in haste and repented at leisure, and that was\nwhy she wasn’t overjoyed at learning she was a good insurance prospect,\nafter all. Married! To God knew whom! Or what! Jail-bird? Defaulter?\nFugitive from justice? It must be pretty bad if she had looked to death\nas a release, poor girl. But why were women such fools?

She hated to be seen. Her mind was so\nconfused, so torn, so messy. She felt that her appearance must be the\nsame. She drew a sobbing breath of relief as she left the village\nbehind and found herself on the “up back” road. There was little fear\nof meeting any one she knew here. The cars that fled by her with\nraucous shrieks were filled with strangers. One of them was packed with\nyoung people who whirled past her singing uproariously:“My wife has the fever, O then,\nMy wife has the fever, O then,\nMy wife has the fever,\nOh, I hope it won’t leave her,\nFor I want to be single again.”Valancy flinched as if one of them had leaned from the car and cut her\nacross the face with a whip.She had made a covenant with death and death had cheated her. Now life\nstood mocking her. She had trapped Barney. Trapped him into marrying\nher. And divorce was so hard to get in Ontario. So expensive. And\nBarney was poor.With life, fear had come back into her heart. Sickening fear. Fear of\nwhat Barney would think. Would say. Fear of the future that must be\nlived without him. Fear of her insulted, repudiated clan.She had had one draught from a divine cup and now it was dashed from\nher lips. With no kind, friendly death to rescue her. She must go on\nliving and longing for it. Everything was spoiled, smirched, defaced.\nEven that year in the Blue Castle. Even her unashamed love for Barney.\nIt had been beautiful because death waited. Now it was only sordid\nbecause death was gone. How could any one bear an unbearable thing?She must go back and tell him. Make him believe she had not meant to\ntrick him—she _must_ make him believe that. She must say good-bye to\nher Blue Castle and return to the brick house on Elm Street. Back to\neverything she had thought left behind forever. The old bondage—the old\nfears.

  "content": "When Valancy reached the pines by the lake she was brought out of her\ndaze of pain by a startling sight. There, parked by the side of old,\nbattered ragged Lady Jane, was another car. A wonderful car. A purple\ncar. Not a dark, royal purple but a blatant, screaming purple. It shone\nlike a mirror and its interior plainly indicated the car caste of Vere\nde Vere. On the driver’s seat sat a haughty chauffeur in livery. And in\nthe tonneau sat a man who opened the door and bounced out nimbly as\nValancy came down the path to the landing-place. He stood under the\npines waiting for her and Valancy took in every detail of him.A stout, short, pudgy man, with a broad, rubicund, good-humoured face—a\nclean-shaven face, though an unparalysed little imp at the back of\nValancy’s paralysed mind suggested the thought, “Such a face should\nhave a fringe of white whisker around it.” Old-fashioned, steel-rimmed\nspectacles on prominent blue eyes. A pursey mouth; a little round,\nknobby nose. Where—where—where, groped Valancy, had she seen that face\nbefore? It seemed as familiar to her as her own.The stranger wore a green hat and a light fawn overcoat over a suit of\na loud check pattern. His tie was a brilliant green of lighter shade;\non the plump hand he outstretched to intercept Valancy an enormous\ndiamond winked at her. But he had a pleasant, fatherly smile, and in\nhis hearty, unmodulated voice was a ring of something that attracted\nher.“Can you tell me, Miss, if that house yonder belongs to a Mr. Redfern?\nAnd if so, how can I get to it?”Redfern! A vision of bottles seemed to dance before Valancy’s eyes—long\nbottles of bitters—round bottles of hair tonic—square bottles of\nliniment—short, corpulent little bottles of purple pills—and all of\nthem bearing that very prosperous, beaming moon-face and steel-rimmed\nspectacles on the label.Dr. Redfern!“No,” said Valancy faintly. “No—that house belongs to Mr. Snaith.”Dr. Redfern nodded.“Yes, I understand Bernie’s been calling himself Snaith. Well, it’s his\nmiddle name—was his poor mother’s. Bernard Snaith Redfern—that’s him.\nAnd now, Miss, you can tell me how to get over to that island? Nobody\nseems to be home there. I’ve done some waving and yelling. Henry,\nthere, wouldn’t yell. He’s a one-job man. But old Doc Redfern can yell\nwith the best of them yet, and ain’t above doing it. Raised nothing but\na couple of crows. Guess Bernie’s out for the day.”“He was away when I left this morning,” said Valancy. “I suppose he\nhasn’t come home yet.”"

In the back of her mind the aforesaid little imp\nwas jeeringly repeating a silly old proverb, “It never rains but it\npours.” But she was not trying to think. What was the use?Dr. Redfern was gazing at her in perplexity.“When you left this morning? Do you live—over there?”He waved his diamond at the Blue Castle.“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly. “I’m his wife.”Dr. Redfern took out a yellow silk handkerchief, removed his hat and\nmopped his brow. He was very bald, and Valancy’s imp whispered, “Why be\nbald? Why lose your manly beauty? Try Redfern’s Hair Vigor. It keeps\nyou young.”“Excuse me,” said Dr. Redfern. “This is a bit of a shock.”“Shocks seem to be in the air this morning.” The imp said this out loud\nbefore Valancy could prevent it.“I didn’t know Bernie was—married. I didn’t think he _would_ have got\nmarried without telling his old dad.”Were Dr. Redfern’s eyes misty? Amid her own dull ache of misery and\nfear and dread, Valancy felt a pang of pity for him.“Don’t blame him,” she said hurriedly. “It—it wasn’t his fault. It—was\nall my doing.”“You didn’t ask him to marry you, I suppose,” twinkled Dr. Redfern. “He\nmight have let me know. I’d have got acquainted with my daughter-in-law\nbefore this if he had.

And all on account of\na white bit of a girl. He must have got over _that_ feeling, anyhow,\nsince he’s married. You must persuade him to come back to civilisation.\nAll nonsense wasting his life like this. Ain’t you going to take me\nover to your house, my dear? I suppose you’ve some way of getting\nthere.”“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly. She led the way down to the little\ncove where the disappearing propeller boat was snuggled.“Does your—your man want to come, too?”“Who? Henry. Not he. Look at him sitting there disapproving.\nDisapproves of the whole expedition. The trail up from the road nearly\ngave him a conniption.

It looks\nlike the great-great-grand-mother of all the Fords.”“It isn’t a Ford. It’s a Grey Slosson,” said Valancy spiritedly. For\nsome occult reason, Dr. Redfern’s good-humoured ridicule of dear old\nLady Jane stung her to life. A life that was all pain but still _life_.\nBetter than the horrible half-dead-and-half-aliveness of the past few\nminutes—or years. She waved Dr. Redfern curtly into the boat and took\nhim over to the Blue Castle. The key was still in the old pine—the\nhouse still silent and deserted. Valancy took the doctor through the\nliving-room to the western verandah. She must at least be out where\nthere was air. It was still sunny, but in the southwest a great\nthundercloud, with white crests and gorges of purple shadow, was slowly\nrising over Mistawis. The doctor dropped with a gasp on a rustic chair\nand mopped his brow again.“Warm, eh? Lord, what a view! Wonder if it would soften Henry if he\ncould see it.”“Have you had dinner?” asked Valancy.“Yes, my dear—had it before we left Port Lawrence. Didn’t know what\nsort of wild hermit’s hollow we were coming to, you see. Hadn’t any\nidea I was going to find a nice little daughter-in-law here all ready\nto toss me up a meal. Cats, eh? Puss, puss! See that. Cats love me.\nBernie was always fond of cats! It’s about the only thing he took from\nme. He’s his poor mother’s boy.”Valancy had been thinking idly that Barney must resemble his mother.\nShe had remained standing by the steps, but Dr. Redfern waved her to\nthe swing seat."

No beauty—you\ndon’t mind my saying that—you’ve sense enough to know it, I reckon. Sit\ndown.”Valancy sat down. To be obliged to sit still when mental agony urges us\nto stride up and down is the refinement of torture. Every nerve in her\nbeing was crying out to be alone—to be hidden. But she had to sit and\nlisten to Dr. Redfern, who didn’t mind talking at all.“When do you think Bernie will be back?”“I don’t know—not before night probably.”“Where did he go?”“I don’t know that either. Likely to the woods—up back.”“So he doesn’t tell you his comings and goings, either? Bernie was\nalways a secretive young devil. Never understood him. Just like his\npoor mother. But I thought a lot of him. It hurt me when he disappeared\nas he did. Eleven years ago. I haven’t seen my boy for eleven years.”“Eleven years.” Valancy was surprised. “It’s only six since he came\nhere.”“Oh, he was in the Klondike before that—and all over the world. He used\nto drop me a line now and then—never give any clue to where he was but\njust a line to say he was all right. I s’pose he’s told you all about\nit.”“No. I know nothing of his past life,” said Valancy with sudden\neagerness. She wanted to know—she must know now. It hadn’t mattered\nbefore. Now she must know all. And she could never hear it from Barney.\nShe might never even see him again. If she did, it would not be to talk\nof his past.“What happened? Why did he leave his home? Tell me. Tell me.”"

You never could make that boy do anything he didn’t want to\ndo. From the day he was born. Yet he was always a quiet, gentle little\nchap, too. Good as gold. His poor mother died when he was only two\nyears old. I’d just begun to make money with my Hair Vigor. I’d dreamed\nthe formula for it, you see. Some dream that. The cash rolled in.\nBernie had everything he wanted. I sent him to the best schools—private\nschools. I meant to make a gentleman of him. Never had any chance\nmyself. Meant he should have every chance. He went through McGill. Got\nhonours and all that. I wanted him to go in for law. He hankered after\njournalism and stuff like that. Wanted me to buy a paper for him—or\nback him in publishing what he called a ‘real, worthwhile,\nhonest-to-goodness Canadian Magazine.’ I s’pose I’d have done it—I\nalways did what he wanted me to do. Wasn’t he all I had to live for? I\nwanted him to be happy. And he never was happy. Can you believe it? Not\nthat he said so. But I’d always a feeling that he wasn’t happy.\nEverything he wanted—all the money he could spend—his own bank\naccount—travel—seeing the world—but he wasn’t happy. Not till he fell\nin love with Ethel Traverse. Then he was happy for a little while.”The cloud had reached the sun and a great, chill, purple shadow came\nswiftly over Mistawis. It touched the Blue Castle—rolled over it.\nValancy shivered.“Yes,” she said, with painful eagerness, though every word was cutting\nher to the heart. “What—was—she—like?”“Prettiest girl in Montreal,” said Dr. Redfern. “Oh, she was a looker,\nall right. Eh? Gold hair—shiny as silk—great, big, soft, black\neyes—skin like milk and roses. Don’t wonder Bernie fell for her. And\nbrains as well. _She_ wasn’t a bit of fluff. B. A. from McGill. A\nthoroughbred, too. One of the best families. But a bit lean in the\npurse. Eh! Bernie was mad about her. Happiest young fool you ever saw.\nThen—the bust-up.”“What happened?” Valancy had taken off her hat and was absently\nthrusting a pin in and out of it. Good Luck was purring beside her.\nBanjo was regarding Dr. Redfern with suspicion. Nip and Tuck were\nlazily cawing in the pines. Mistawis was beckoning. Everything was the\nsame. Nothing was the same. It was a hundred years since yesterday.\nYesterday, at this time, she and Barney had been eating a belated\ndinner here with laughter. Laughter? Valancy felt that she had done\nwith laughter forever. And with tears, for that matter. She had no\nfurther use for either of them.“Blest if I know, my dear. Some fool quarrel, I suppose. Bernie just\nlit out—disappeared. He wrote me from the Yukon. Said his engagement\nwas broken and he wasn’t coming back. And not to try to hunt him up\nbecause he was never coming back. I didn’t. What was the use? I knew\nBernie. I went on piling, up money because there wasn’t anything else\nto do. But I was mighty lonely. All I lived for was them little notes\nnow and then from Bernie—Klondike—England—South\nAfrica—China—everywhere. I thought maybe he’d come back some day to his\nlonesome old dad. Then six years ago even the letters stopped. I didn’t\nhear a word of or from him till last Christmas.”“Did he write?”"

He’d always promised me he’d let me know if Bernie drew\nany checks. Bernie had fifty thousand there. And he’d never touched a\ncent of it till last Christmas. The check was made out to Aynsley’s,\nToronto——”“Aynsley’s?” Valancy heard herself saying Aynsley’s! She had a box on\nher dressing-table with the Aynsley trademark.“Yes. The big jewellery house there. After I’d thought it over a while,\nI got brisk. I wanted to locate Bernie. Had a special reason for it. It\nwas time he gave up his fool hoboing and come to his senses. Drawing\nthat fifteen told me there was something in the wind. The manager\ncommunicated with the Aynsleys—his wife was an Aynsley—and found out\nthat Bernard Redfern had bought a pearl necklace there. His address was\ngiven as Box 444, Port Lawrence, Muskoka, Ont. First I thought I’d\nwrite. Then I thought I’d wait till the open season for cars and come\ndown myself. Ain’t no hand at writing.

O. box there. Lived on an island out here, they said.\nSo here I am. And where’s Barney?”Valancy was fingering her necklace. She was wearing fifteen thousand\ndollars around her neck. And she had worried lest Barney had paid\nfifteen dollars for it and couldn’t afford it. Suddenly she laughed in\nDr. Redfern’s face.“Excuse me. It’s so—amusing,” said poor Valancy.“Isn’t it?” said Dr. Redfern, seeing a joke—but not exactly hers. “Now,\nyou seem like a sensible young woman, and I dare say you’ve lots of\ninfluence over Bernie. Can’t you get him to come back to civilisation\nand live like other people? I’ve a house up there. Big as a castle.\nFurnished like a palace. I want company in it—Bernie’s wife—Bernie’s\nchildren.”“Did Ethel Traverse ever marry?” queried Valancy irrelevantly."

  "content": "She must write a note. The imp in the back of her mind laughed. In\nevery story she had ever read when a runaway wife decamped from home\nshe left a note, generally on the pin-cushion. It was not a very\noriginal idea. But one had to leave something intelligible. What was\nthere to do but write a note? She looked vaguely about her for\nsomething to write with. Ink? There was none. Valancy had never written\nanything since she had come to the Blue Castle, save memoranda of\nhousehold necessaries for Barney. A pencil sufficed for them, but now\nthe pencil was not to be found. Valancy absently crossed to the door of\nBluebeard’s Chamber and tried it. She vaguely expected to find it\nlocked, but it opened unresistingly. She had never tried it before, and\ndid not know whether Barney habitually kept it locked or not. If he\ndid, he must have been badly upset to leave it unlocked. She did not\nrealise that she was doing something he had told her not to do. She was\nonly looking for something to write with. All her faculties were\nconcentrated on deciding just what she would say and how she would say\nit. There was not the slightest curiosity in her as she went into the\nlean-to.There were no beautiful women hanging by their hair on the walls. It\nseemed a very harmless apartment, with a commonplace little sheet-iron\nstove in the middle of it, its pipe sticking out through the roof. At\none end was a table or counter crowded with odd-looking utensils. Used\nno doubt by Barney in his smelly operations. Chemical experiments,\nprobably, she reflected dully. At the other end was a big writing desk\nand swivel-chair. The side walls were lined with books.Valancy went blindly to the desk. There she stood motionless for a few\nminutes, looking down at something that lay on it. A bundle of\ngalley-proofs. The page on top bore the title _Wild Honey_, and under\nthe title were the words “by John Foster.”The opening sentence—“Pines are the trees of myth and legend. They\nstrike their roots deep into the traditions of an older world, but wind\nand star love their lofty tops. What music when old Æolus draws his bow\nacross the branches of the pines—” She had heard Barney say that one\nday when they walked under them.So Barney was John Foster!Valancy was not excited. She had absorbed all the shocks and sensations\nthat she could compass for one day. This affected her neither one way\nnor the other. She only thought:“So this explains it.”“It” was a small matter that had, somehow, stuck in her mind more\npersistently than its importance seemed to justify. Soon after Barney\nhad brought her John Foster’s latest book she had been in a Port\nLawrence bookshop and heard a customer ask the proprietor for John\nFoster’s new book. The proprietor had said curtly, “Not out yet. Won’t\nbe out till next week.”Valancy had opened her lips to say, “Oh, yes, it _is_ out,” but closed\nthem again. After all, it was none of her business. She supposed the\nproprietor wanted to cover up his negligence in not getting the book in\npromptly. Now she knew. The book Barney had given her had been one of\nthe author’s complimentary copies, sent in advance."

There never was anything serious the matter with my\nheart and I am quite well now.I did not mean to trick you. Please believe that. I could not bear it\nif you did not believe that. I am very sorry for the mistake. But\nsurely you can get a divorce if I leave you. Is desertion a ground for\ndivorce in Canada?

Think\nas kindly of me as you can, because I did not mean to trap you.\nGood-bye.Yours gratefully,VALANCY.”It was very cold and stiff, she knew. But to try to say anything else\nwould be dangerous—like tearing away a dam. She didn’t know what\ntorrent of wild incoherences and passionate anguish might pour out. In\na postscript she added:“Your father was here today. He is coming back tomorrow. He told me\neverything. I think you should go back to him. He is very lonely for\nyou.”She put the letter in an envelope, wrote “Barney” across it, and left\nit on the desk. On it she laid the string of pearls. If they had been\nthe beads she believed them she would have kept them in memory of that\nwonderful year. But she could not keep the fifteen thousand dollar gift\nof a man who had married her out of pity and whom she was now leaving.\nIt hurt her to give up her pretty bauble.

Then she crossed to\nthe mainland in the disappearing propeller. She stood for a moment on\nthe bank, looking at her Blue Castle. The rain had not yet come, but\nthe sky was dark, and Mistawis grey and sullen. The little house under\nthe pines looked very pathetic—a casket rifled of its jewels—a lamp\nwith its flame blown out.“I shall never again hear the wind crying over Mistawis at night,”\nthought Valancy. This hurt her, too. She could have laughed to think\nthat such a trifle could hurt her at such a time.CHAPTER XLValancy paused a moment on the porch of the brick house in Elm Street.\nShe felt that she ought to knock like a stranger. Her rosebush, she\nidly noticed, was loaded with buds. The rubber-plant stood beside the\nprim door. A momentary horror overcame her—a horror of the existence to\nwhich she was returning. Then she opened the door and walked in.“I wonder if the Prodigal Son ever felt really at home again,” she\nthought.Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles were in the sitting-room. Uncle\nBenjamin was there, too. They looked blankly at Valancy, realising at\nonce that something was wrong. This was not the saucy, impudent thing\nwho had laughed at them in this very room last summer. This was a\ngrey-faced woman with the eyes of a creature who had been stricken by a\nmortal blow.Valancy looked indifferently around the room. She had changed so\nmuch—and it had changed so little. The same pictures hung on the walls.\nThe little orphan who knelt at her never-finished prayer by the bed\nwhereon reposed the black kitten that never grew up into a cat. The\ngrey “steel engraving” of Quatre Bras, where the British regiment\nforever stood at bay. The crayon enlargement of the boyish father she\nhad never known. There they all hung in the same places. The green\ncascade of “Wandering Jew” still tumbled out of the old granite\nsaucepan on the window-stand. The same elaborate, never-used pitcher\nstood at the same angle on the sideboard shelf. The blue and gilt vases\nthat had been among her mother’s wedding-presents still primly adorned\nthe mantelpiece, flanking the china clock of berosed and besprayed ware\nthat never went. The chairs in exactly the same places. Her mother and\nCousin Stickles, likewise unchanged, regarding her with stony\nunwelcome.Valancy had to speak first."

She had almost succeeded in forgetting\nthere was a Valancy. She had rearranged and organised her systematic\nlife without any reference to an ungrateful, rebellious child. She had\ntaken her place again in a society which ignored the fact that she had\never had a daughter and pitied her, if it pitied her at all, only in\ndiscreet whispers and asides. The plain truth was that, by this time,\nMrs. Frederick did not want Valancy to come back—did not want ever to\nsee or hear of her again.And now, of course, Valancy was here. With tragedy and disgrace and\nscandal trailing after her visibly. “So I see,” said Mrs. Frederick.\n“May I ask why?”“Because—I’m—not—going to die,” said Valancy huskily.“God bless my soul!” said Uncle Benjamin. “Who said you were going to\ndie?”“I suppose,” said Cousin Stickles shrewishly—Cousin Stickles did not\nwant Valancy back either—“I suppose you’ve found out he has another\nwife—as we’ve been sure all along.”“No. I only wish he had,” said Valancy. She was not suffering\nparticularly, but she was very tired. If only the explanations were all\nover and she were upstairs in her old, ugly room—alone. Just alone! The\nrattle of the beads on her mother’s sleeves, as they swung on the arms\nof the reed chair, almost drove her crazy. Nothing else was worrying\nher; but all at once it seemed that she simply could not endure that\nthin, insistent rattle.“My home, as I told you, is always open to you,” said Mrs. Frederick\nstonily, “but I can never forgive you.”Valancy gave a mirthless laugh.“I’d care very little for that if I could only forgive myself,” she\nsaid.“Come, come,” said Uncle Benjamin testily.
