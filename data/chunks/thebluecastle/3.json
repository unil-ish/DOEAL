  "content": "Valancy had walked out to Roaring Abel’s house on the Mistawis road\nunder a sky of purple and amber, with a queer exhilaration and\nexpectancy in her heart. Back there, behind her, her mother and Cousin\nStickles were crying—over themselves, not over her. But here the wind\nwas in her face, soft, dew-wet, cool, blowing along the grassy roads.\nOh, she loved the wind! The robins were whistling sleepily in the firs\nalong the way and the moist air was fragrant with the tang of balsam.\nBig cars went purring past in the violet dusk—the stream of summer\ntourists to Muskoka had already begun—but Valancy did not envy any of\ntheir occupants. Muskoka cottages might be charming, but beyond, in the\nsunset skies, among the spires of the firs, her Blue Castle towered.\nShe brushed the old years and habits and inhibitions away from her like\ndead leaves. She would not be littered with them.Roaring Abel’s rambling, tumble-down old house was situated about three\nmiles from the village, on the very edge of “up back,” as the sparsely\nsettled, hilly, wooded country around Mistawis was called vernacularly.\nIt did not, it must be confessed, look much like a Blue Castle.It had once been a snug place enough in the days when Abel Gay had been\nyoung and prosperous, and the punning, arched sign over the gate—“A.\nGay, Carpenter,” had been fine and freshly painted. Now it was a faded,\ndreary old place, with a leprous, patched roof and shutters hanging\naskew. Abel never seemed to do any carpenter jobs about his own house.\nIt had a listless air, as if tired of life. There was a dwindling grove\nof ragged, crone-like old spruces behind it. The garden, which Cissy\nused to keep neat and pretty, had run wild. On two sides of the house\nwere fields full of nothing but mulleins. Behind the house was a long\nstretch of useless barrens, full of scrub pines and spruces, with here\nand there a blossoming bit of wild cherry, running back to a belt of\ntimber on the shores of Lake Mistawis, two miles away. A rough, rocky,\nboulder-strewn lane ran through it to the woods—a lane white with\npestiferous, beautiful daisies.Roaring Abel met Valancy at the door.“So you’ve come,” he said incredulously. “I never s’posed that ruck of\nStirlings would let you.”Valancy showed all her pointed teeth in a grin.“They couldn’t stop me.”“I didn’t think you’d so much spunk,” said Roaring Abel admiringly.\n“And look at the nice ankles of her,” he added, as he stepped aside to\nlet her in.If Cousin Stickles had heard this she would have been certain that\nValancy’s doom, earthly and unearthly, was sealed. But Abel’s\nsuperannuated gallantry did not worry Valancy. Besides, this was the\nfirst compliment she had ever received in her life and she found\nherself liking it. She sometimes suspected she had nice ankles, but\nnobody had ever mentioned it before. In the Stirling clan ankles were\namong the unmentionables."

  "content": "Roaring Abel took her into the kitchen, where Cissy Gay was lying on\nthe sofa, breathing quickly, with little scarlet spots on her hollow\ncheeks. Valancy had not seen Cecilia Gay for years. Then she had been\nsuch a pretty creature, a slight, blossom-like girl, with soft, golden\nhair, clear-cut, almost waxen features, and large, beautiful blue eyes.\nShe was shocked at the change in her. Could this be sweet Cissy—this\npitiful little thing that looked like a tired, broken flower? She had\nwept all the beauty out of her eyes; they looked too big—enormous—in\nher wasted face. The last time Valancy had seen Cecilia Gay those\nfaded, piteous eyes had been limpid, shadowy blue pools aglow with\nmirth. The contrast was so terrible that Valancy’s own eyes filled with\ntears. She knelt down by Cissy and put her arms about her.“Cissy dear, I’ve come to look after you. I’ll stay with you\ntill—till—as long as you want me.”“Oh!” Cissy put her thin arms about Valancy’s neck. “Oh—_will_ you?\nIt’s been so—lonely. I can wait on myself—but it’s been so _lonely_.\nIt—would just be like—heaven—to have some one here—like you. You were\nalways—so sweet to me—long ago.”Valancy held Cissy close. She was suddenly happy. Here was some one who\nneeded her—some one she could help. She was no longer a superfluity.\nOld things had passed away; everything had become new.“Most things are predestinated, but some are just darn sheer luck,”\nsaid Roaring Abel, complacently smoking his pipe in the corner.CHAPTER XVIIWhen Valancy had lived for a week at Roaring Abel’s she felt as if\nyears had separated her from her old life and all the people she had\nknown in it. They were beginning to seem remote—dream-like—far-away—and\nas the days went on they seemed still more so, until they ceased to\nmatter altogether.She was happy. Nobody ever bothered her with conundrums or insisted on\ngiving her Purple Pills. Nobody called her Doss or worried her about\ncatching cold. There were no quilts to piece, no abominable\nrubber-plant to water, no ice-cold maternal tantrums to endure. She\ncould be alone whenever she liked, go to bed when she liked, sneeze\nwhen she liked. In the long, wondrous, northern twilights, when Cissy\nwas asleep and Roaring Abel away, she could sit for hours on the shaky\nback verandah steps, looking out over the barrens to the hills beyond,\ncovered with their fine, purple bloom, listening to the friendly wind\nsinging wild, sweet melodies in the little spruces, and drinking in the\naroma of the sunned grasses, until darkness flowed over the landscape\nlike a cool, welcome wave."

  "content": "Sometimes of an afternoon, when Cissy was strong enough, the two girls\nwent into the barrens and looked at the wood-flowers. But they did not\npick any. Valancy had read to Cissy the gospel thereof according to\nJohn Foster: “It is a pity to gather wood-flowers. They lose half their\nwitchery away from the green and the flicker. The way to enjoy\nwood-flowers is to track them down to their remote haunts—gloat over\nthem—and then leave them with backward glances, taking with us only the\nbeguiling memory of their grace and fragrance.”Valancy was in the midst of realities after a lifetime of unrealities.\nAnd busy—very busy. The house had to be cleaned. Not for nothing had\nValancy been brought up in the Stirling habits of neatness and\ncleanliness. If she found satisfaction in cleaning dirty rooms she got\nher fill of it there. Roaring Abel thought she was foolish to bother\ndoing so much more than she was asked to do, but he did not interfere\nwith her. He was very well satisfied with his bargain. Valancy was a\ngood cook. Abel said she got a flavour into things. The only fault he\nfound with her was that she did not sing at her work.“Folks should always sing at their work,” he insisted. “Sounds\ncheerful-like.”“Not always,” retorted Valancy. “Fancy a butcher singing at his work.\nOr an undertaker.”Abel burst into his great broad laugh.“There’s no getting the better of you. You’ve got an answer every time.\nI should think the Stirlings would be glad to be rid of you. _They_\ndon’t like being sassed back.”During the day Abel was generally away from home—if not working, then\nshooting or fishing with Barney Snaith. He generally came home at\nnights—always very late and often very drunk. The first night they\nheard him come howling into the yard, Cissy had told Valancy not to be\nafraid.“Father never does anything—he just makes a noise.”Valancy, lying on the sofa in Cissy’s room, where she had elected to\nsleep, lest Cissy should need attention in the night—Cissy would never\nhave called her—was not at all afraid, and said so. By the time Abel\nhad got his horses put away, the roaring stage had passed and he was in\nhis room at the end of the hall crying and praying. Valancy could still\nhear his dismal moans when she went calmly to sleep. For the most part,\nAbel was a good-natured creature, but occasionally he had a temper.\nOnce Valancy asked him coolly:“What is the use of getting in a rage?”“It’s such a d——d relief,” said Abel.They both burst out laughing together."

  "content": "“You’re a great little sport,” said Abel admiringly. “Don’t mind my bad\nFrench. I don’t mean a thing by it. Jest habit. Say, I like a woman\nthat ain’t afraid to speak up to me. Sis there was always too meek—too\nmeek. That’s why she got adrift. I like you.”“All the same,” said Valancy determinedly, “there is no use in sending\nthings to hell as you’re always doing. And I’m _not_ going to have you\ntracking mud all over a floor I’ve just scrubbed. You _must_ use the\nscraper whether you consign it to perdition or not.”Cissy loved the cleanness and neatness. She had kept it so, too, until\nher strength failed. She was very pitifully happy because she had\nValancy with her. It had been so terrible—the long, lonely days and\nnights with no companionship save those dreadful old women who came to\nwork. Cissy had hated and feared them. She clung to Valancy like a\nchild.There was no doubt that Cissy was dying. Yet at no time did she seem\nalarmingly ill. She did not even cough a great deal. Most days she was\nable to get up and dress—sometimes even to work about in the garden or\nthe barrens for an hour or two. For a few weeks after Valancy’s coming\nshe seemed so much better that Valancy began to hope she might get\nwell. But Cissy shook her head.“No, I can’t get well. My lungs are almost gone. And I—don’t want to.\nI’m so tired, Valancy. Only dying can rest me. But it’s lovely to have\nyou here—you’ll never know how much it means to me. But Valancy—you\nwork too hard. You don’t need to—Father only wants his meals cooked. I\ndon’t think you are strong yourself. You turn so pale sometimes. And\nthose drops you take. _Are_ you well, dear?”“I’m all right,” said Valancy lightly. She would not have Cissy\nworried. “And I’m not working hard. I’m glad to have some work to\ndo—something that really wants to be done.”"

  "content": "“Then”—Cissy slipped her hand wistfully into Valancy’s—“don’t let’s\ntalk any more about my being sick. Let’s just forget it. Let’s pretend\nI’m a little girl again—and you have come here to play with me. I used\nto wish that long ago—wish that you could come. I knew you couldn’t, of\ncourse. But how I did wish it! You always seemed so different from the\nother girls—so kind and sweet—and as if you had something in yourself\nnobody knew about—some dear, pretty secret. _Had_ you, Valancy?”“I had my Blue Castle,” said Valancy, laughing a little. She was\npleased that Cissy had thought of her like this. She had never\nsuspected that anybody liked or admired or wondered about her. She told\nCissy all about her Blue Castle. She had never told any one about it\nbefore.“Every one has a Blue Castle, I think,” said Cissy softly. “Only every\none has a different name for it. _I_ had mine—once.”She put her two thin little hands over her face. She did not tell\nValancy—then—who had destroyed her Blue Castle. But Valancy knew that,\nwhoever it was, it was not Barney Snaith.CHAPTER XVIIIValancy was acquainted with Barney by now—well acquainted, it seemed,\nthough she had spoken to him only a few times. But then she had felt\njust as well acquainted with him the first time they had met. She had\nbeen in the garden at twilight, hunting for a few stalks of white\nnarcissus for Cissy’s room when she heard that terrible old Grey\nSlosson coming down through the woods from Mistawis—one could hear it\nmiles away. Valancy did not look up as it drew near, thumping over the\nrocks in that crazy lane. She had never looked up, though Barney had\ngone racketting past every evening since she had been at Roaring\nAbel’s. This time he did not racket past. The old Grey Slosson stopped\nwith even more terrible noises than it made going. Valancy was\nconscious that Barney had sprung from it and was leaning over the\nramshackle gate. She suddenly straightened up and looked into his face.\nTheir eyes met—Valancy was suddenly conscious of a delicious weakness.\nWas one of her heart attacks coming on?—But this was a new symptom."

  "content": "His eyes, which she had always thought brown, now seen close, were deep\nviolet—translucent and intense. Neither of his eyebrows looked like the\nother. He was thin—too thin—she wished she could feed him up a bit—she\nwished she could sew the buttons on his coat—and make him cut his\nhair—and shave every day. There was _something_ in his face—one hardly\nknew what it was. Tiredness? Sadness? Disillusionment? He had dimples\nin his thin cheeks when he smiled. All these thoughts flashed through\nValancy’s mind in that one moment while his eyes looked into hers.“Good-evening, Miss Stirling.”Nothing could be more commonplace and conventional. Any one might have\nsaid it. But Barney Snaith had a way of saying things that gave them\npoignancy. When he said good-evening you felt that it _was_ a good\nevening and that it was partly his doing that it was. Also, you felt\nthat some of the credit was yours. Valancy felt all this vaguely, but\nshe couldn’t imagine why she was trembling from head to foot—it _must_\nbe her heart. If only he didn’t notice it!“I’m going over to the Port,” Barney was saying. “Can I acquire merit\nby getting or doing anything there for you or Cissy?”“Will you get some salt codfish for us?” said Valancy. It was the only\nthing she could think of. Roaring Abel had expressed a desire that day\nfor a dinner of boiled salt codfish. When her knights came riding to\nthe Blue Castle, Valancy had sent them on many a quest, but she had\nnever asked any of them to get her salt codfish.“Certainly. You’re sure there’s nothing else? Lots of room in Lady Jane\nGrey Slosson. And she always gets back _some_ time, does Lady Jane.”“I don’t think there’s anything more,” said Valancy. She knew he would\nbring oranges for Cissy anyhow—he always did.Barney did not turn away at once. He was silent for a little. Then he\nsaid, slowly and whimsically:“Miss Stirling, you’re a brick! You’re a whole cartload of bricks. To\ncome here and look after Cissy—under the circumstances.”“There’s nothing so bricky about that,” said Valancy. “I’d nothing else\nto do. And—I like it here. I don’t feel as if I’d done anything\nspecially meritorious. Mr. Gay is paying me fair wages. I never earned\nany money before—and I like it.” It seemed so easy to talk to Barney\nSnaith, someway—this terrible Barney Snaith of the lurid tales and\nmysterious past—as easy and natural as if talking to herself."

And if there’s\nanything I can do to help you in any way, you have only to let me know.\nIf Roaring Abel ever tries to annoy you——”“He doesn’t. He’s lovely to me. I like Roaring Abel,” said Valancy\nfrankly.“So do I. But there’s one stage of his drunkenness—perhaps you haven’t\nencountered it yet—when he sings ribald songs——”“Oh, yes. He came home last night like that. Cissy and I just went to\nour room and shut ourselves in where we couldn’t hear him. He\napologised this morning. I’m not afraid of any of Roaring Abel’s\nstages.”“Well, I’m sure he’ll be decent to you, apart from his inebriated\nyowls,” said Barney. “And I’ve told him he’s got to stop damning things\nwhen you’re around.”“Why?” asked Valancy slily, with one of her odd, slanted glances and a\nsudden flake of pink on each cheek, born of the thought that Barney\nSnaith had actually done so much for _her_. “I often feel like damning\nthings myself.”For a moment Barney stared. Was this elfin girl the little, old-maidish\ncreature who had stood there two minutes ago? Surely there was magic\nand devilry going on in that shabby, weedy old garden.Then he laughed.“It will be a relief to have some one to do it for you, then. So you\ndon’t want anything but salt codfish?”“Not tonight. But I dare say I’ll have some errands for you very often\nwhen you go to Port Lawrence. I can’t trust Mr. Gay to remember to\nbring all the things I want.”Barney had gone away, then, in his Lady Jane, and Valancy stood in the\ngarden for a long time.Since then he had called several times, walking down through the\nbarrens, whistling. How that whistle of his echoed through the spruces\non those June twilights! Valancy caught herself listening for it every\nevening—rebuked herself—then let herself go. Why shouldn’t she listen\nfor it?He always brought Cissy fruit and flowers. Once he brought Valancy a\nbox of candy—the first box of candy she had ever been given. It seemed\nsacrilege to eat it."

  "content": "She found herself thinking of him in season and out of season. She\nwanted to know if he ever thought about her when she wasn’t before his\neyes, and, if so, what. She wanted to see that mysterious house of his\nback on the Mistawis island. Cissy had never seen it. Cissy, though she\ntalked freely of Barney and had known him for five years, really knew\nlittle more of him than Valancy herself.“But he isn’t bad,” said Cissy. “Nobody need ever tell me he is. He\n_can’t_ have done a thing to be ashamed of.”“Then why does he live as he does?” asked Valancy—to hear somebody\ndefend him.“I don’t know. He’s a mystery. And of course there’s something behind\nit, but I _know_ it isn’t disgrace. Barney Snaith simply couldn’t do\nanything disgraceful, Valancy.”Valancy was not so sure. Barney must have done _something_—sometime. He\nwas a man of education and intelligence. She had soon discovered that,\nin listening to his conversations and wrangles with Roaring Abel—who\nwas surprisingly well read and could discuss any subject under the sun\nwhen sober. Such a man wouldn’t bury himself for five years in Muskoka\nand live and look like a tramp if there were not too good—or bad—a\nreason for it. But it didn’t matter. All that mattered was that she was\nsure now that he had never been Cissy Gay’s lover. There was nothing\nlike _that_ between them. Though he was very fond of Cissy and she of\nhim, as any one could see. But it was a fondness that didn’t worry\nValancy.“You don’t know what Barney has been to me, these past two years,”\nCissy had said simply. “_Everything_ would have been unbearable without\nhim.”“Cissy Gay is the sweetest girl I ever knew—and there’s a man somewhere\nI’d like to shoot if I could find him,” Barney had said savagely."

  "content": "Barney was an interesting talker, with a knack of telling a great deal\nabout his adventures and nothing at all about himself. There was one\nglorious rainy day when Barney and Abel swapped yarns all the afternoon\nwhile Valancy mended tablecloths and listened. Barney told weird tales\nof his adventures with “shacks” on trains while hoboing it across the\ncontinent. Valancy thought she ought to think his stealing rides quite\ndreadful, but didn’t. The story of his working his way to England on a\ncattle-ship sounded more legitimate. And his yarns of the Yukon\nenthralled her—especially the one of the night he was lost on the\ndivide between Gold Run and Sulphur Valley. He had spent two years out\nthere. Where in all this was there room for the penitentiary and the\nother things?If he were telling the truth. But Valancy knew he was.“Found no gold,” he said. “Came away poorer than when I went. But such\na place to live! Those silences at the back of the north wind _got_ me.\nI’ve never belonged to myself since.”Yet he was not a great talker. He told a great deal in a few\nwell-chosen words—how well-chosen Valancy did not realise. And he had a\nknack of saying things without opening his mouth at all.“I like a man whose eyes say more than his lips,” thought Valancy.But then she liked everything about him—his tawny hair—his whimsical\nsmiles—the little glints of fun in his eyes—his loyal affection for\nthat unspeakable Lady Jane—his habit of sitting with his hands in his\npockets, his chin sunk on his breast, looking up from under his\nmismated eyebrows. She liked his nice voice which sounded as if it\nmight become caressing or wooing with very little provocation. She was\nat times almost afraid to let herself think these thoughts. They were\nso vivid that she felt as if the others _must_ know what she was\nthinking.“I’ve been watching a woodpecker all day,” he said one evening on the\nshaky old back verandah. His account of the woodpecker’s doings was\nsatisfying. He had often some gay or cunning little anecdote of the\nwood folk to tell them. And sometimes he and Roaring Abel smoked\nfiercely the whole evening and never said a word, while Cissy lay in\nthe hammock swung between the verandah posts and Valancy sat idly on\nthe steps, her hands clasped over her knees, and wondered dreamily if\nshe were really Valancy Stirling and if it were only three weeks since\nshe had left the ugly old house on Elm Street."

Barney, when he liked, could sit down on the\nedge of the barrens and lure those rabbits right to him by some\nmysterious sorcery he possessed. Valancy had once seen a squirrel leap\nfrom a scrub pine to his shoulder and sit there chattering to him. It\nreminded her of John Foster.It was one of the delights of Valancy’s new life that she could read\nJohn Foster’s books as often and as long as she liked. She could read\nthem in bed if she wanted to. She read them all to Cissy, who loved\nthem. She also tried to read them to Abel and Barney, who did not love\nthem. Abel was bored and Barney politely refused to listen at all.“Piffle,” said Barney.CHAPTER XIXOf course, the Stirlings had not left the poor maniac alone all this\ntime or refrained from heroic efforts to rescue her perishing soul and\nreputation. Uncle James, whose lawyer had helped him as little as his\ndoctor, came one day and, finding Valancy alone in the kitchen, as he\nsupposed, gave her a terrible talking-to—told her she was breaking her\nmother’s heart and disgracing her family.“But _why_?” said Valancy, not ceasing to scour her porridge pot\ndecently. “I’m doing honest work for honest pay. What is there in that\nthat is disgraceful?”“Don’t quibble, Valancy,” said Uncle James solemnly. “This is no fit\nplace for you to be, and you know it. Why, I’m told that jail-bird,\nSnaith, is hanging around here every evening.”“Not _every_ evening,” said Valancy reflectively. “No, not quite every\nevening.”“It’s—it’s insufferable!” said Uncle James violently. “Valancy, you\n_must_ come home. We won’t judge you harshly. I assure you we won’t.\nWe will overlook all this.”“Thank you,” said Valancy.“Have you no sense of shame?” demanded Uncle James.“Oh, yes. But the things _I_ am ashamed of are not the things _you_ are\nashamed of.” Valancy proceeded to rinse her dishcloth meticulously.Still was Uncle James patient. He gripped the sides of his chair and\nground his teeth.“We know your mind isn’t just right. We’ll make allowances. But you\n_must_ come home.

His red beard fairly bristled\nwith indignation and his huge eyebrows quivered. But cowardice was not\namong James Stirling’s shortcomings.“I was. And, furthermore, I want to tell you that you have acted an\niniquitous part in luring this weak and unfortunate girl away from her\nhome and friends, and I will have you punished yet for it——”James Stirling got no further. Roaring Abel crossed the kitchen at a\nbound, caught him by his collar and his trousers, and hurled him\nthrough the doorway and over the garden paling with as little apparent\neffort as he might have employed in whisking a troublesome kitten out\nof the way.“The next time you come back here,” he bellowed, “I’ll throw you\nthrough the window—and all the better if the window is shut! Coming\nhere, thinking yourself God to put the world to rights!”Valancy candidly and unashamedly owned to herself that she had seen few\nmore satisfying sights than Uncle James’ coat-tails flying out into the\nasparagus bed. She had once been afraid of this man’s judgment. Now she\nsaw clearly that he was nothing but a rather stupid little village\ntin-god.Roaring Abel turned with his great broad laugh.“He’ll think of that for years when he wakes up in the night. The\nAlmighty made a mistake in making so many Stirlings. But since they are\nmade, we’ve got to reckon with them. Too many to kill out.

He did not believe Valancy Stirling\nwas out of her mind. She had always been queer. He, Dr. Stalling, had\nnever been able to understand her. Therefore, beyond doubt, she was\nqueer. She was only just a little queerer than usual now. And Dr.\nStalling had his own reasons for disliking Roaring Abel. When Dr.\nStalling had first come to Deerwood he had had a liking for long hikes\naround Mistawis and Muskoka. On one of these occasions he had got lost\nand after much wandering had fallen in with Roaring Abel with his gun\nover his shoulder.Dr. Stalling had contrived to ask his question in about the most\nidiotic manner possible. He said, “Can you tell me where I’m going?”“How the devil should I know where you’re going, gosling?” retorted\nAbel contemptuously.Dr. Stalling was so enraged that he could not speak for a moment or two\nand in that moment Abel had disappeared in the woods. Dr. Stalling had\neventually found his way home, but he had never hankered to encounter\nAbel Gay again.Nevertheless he came now to do his duty. Valancy greeted him with a\nsinking heart. She had to own to herself that she was terribly afraid\nof Dr. Stalling still. She had a miserable conviction that if he shook\nhis long, bony finger at her and told her to go home, she dared not\ndisobey.“Mr. Gay,” said Dr. Stalling politely and condescendingly, “may I see\nMiss Stirling alone for a few minutes?”Roaring Abel was a little drunk—just drunk enough to be excessively\npolite and very cunning. He had been on the point of going away when\nDr. Stalling arrived, but now he sat down in a corner of the parlour\nand folded his arms.“No, no, mister,” he said solemnly. “That wouldn’t do—wouldn’t do at\nall. I’ve got the reputation of my household to keep up. I’ve got to\nchaperone this young lady. Can’t have any sparkin’ going on here behind\nmy back.”Outraged Dr. Stalling looked so terrible that Valancy wondered how Abel\ncould endure his aspect. But Abel was not worried at all.“D’ye know anything about it, anyway?” he asked genially.“About _what_?”“Sparking,” said Abel coolly.Poor Dr. Stalling, who had never married because he believed in a\ncelibate clergy, would not notice this ribald remark. He turned his\nback on Abel and addressed himself to Valancy.“Miss Stirling, I am here in response to your mother’s wishes. She\nbegged me to come. I am charged with some messages from her. Will\nyou”—he wagged his forefinger—“will you hear them?”“Yes,” said Valancy faintly, eyeing the forefinger. It had a hypnotic\neffect on her."

Troubled with an\nimpediment in your speech, ain’t you, Mister?”“—this _place_ and return to your home, Mr. James Stirling will himself\npay for a good nurse to come here and wait on Miss Gay.”Back of her terror Valancy smiled in secret. Uncle James must indeed\nregard the matter as desperate when he would loosen his purse-strings\nlike that. At any rate, her clan no longer despised her or ignored her.\nShe had become important to them.“That’s _my_ business, Mister,” said Abel. “Miss Stirling can go if she\npleases, or stay if she pleases. I made a fair bargain with her, and\nshe’s free to conclude it when she likes. She gives me meals that stick\nto my ribs. She don’t forget to put salt in the porridge. She never\nslams doors, and when she has nothing to say she don’t talk. That’s\nuncanny in a woman, you know, Mister. I’m satisfied. If she isn’t,\nshe’s free to go. But no woman comes here in Jim Stirling’s pay. If any\none does”—Abel’s voice was uncannily bland and polite—“I’ll spatter the\nroad with her brains. Tell him that with A. Gay’s compliments.”“Dr. Stalling, a nurse is not what Cissy needs,” said Valancy\nearnestly. “She isn’t so ill as that, yet. What she wants is\ncompanionship—somebody she knows and likes just to live with her. You\ncan understand that, I’m sure.”“I understand that your motive is quite—ahem—commendable.” Dr. Stalling\nfelt that he was very broad-minded indeed—especially as in his secret\nsoul he did not believe Valancy’s motive _was_ commendable. He hadn’t\nthe least idea what she was up to, but he was sure her motive was not\ncommendable. When he could not understand a thing he straightway\ncondemned it. Simplicity itself! “But your first duty is to your\nmother. _She_ needs you. She implores you to come home—she will forgive\neverything if you will only come home.”“That’s a pretty little thought,” remarked Abel meditatively, as he\nground some tobacco up in his hand.Dr. Stalling ignored him."

As your pastor and spiritual\nguide, I command you to come home with me—this very day. Get your hat\nand coat and come _now_.”Dr. Stalling shook his finger at Valancy. Before that pitiless finger\nshe drooped and wilted visibly.“She’s giving in,” thought Roaring Abel. “She’ll go with him. Beats\nall, the power these preacher fellows have over women.”Valancy _was_ on the point of obeying Dr. Stalling. She must go home\nwith him—and give up. She would lapse back to Doss Stirling again and\nfor her few remaining days or weeks be the cowed, futile creature she\nhad always been. It was her fate—typified by that relentless, uplifted\nforefinger. She could no more escape from it than Roaring Abel from his\npredestination. She eyed it as the fascinated bird eyes the snake.\nAnother moment—“_Fear is the original sin_,” suddenly said a still, small voice away\nback—back—back of Valancy’s consciousness. “_Almost all the evil in the\nworld has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of\nsomething_.”Valancy stood up. She was still in the clutches of fear, but her soul\nwas her own again. She would not be false to that inner voice.“Dr. Stalling,” she said slowly, “I do not at present owe _any_ duty to\nmy mother. She is quite well; she has all the assistance and\ncompanionship she requires; she does not need me at all. I _am_ needed\nhere. I am going to stay here.”“There’s spunk for you,” said Roaring Abel admiringly.Dr. Stalling dropped his forefinger. One could not keep on shaking a\nfinger forever.“Miss Stirling, is there _nothing_ that can influence you? Do you\nremember your childhood days——”“Perfectly. And hate them.”“Do you realise what people will say? What they _are_ saying?”“I can imagine it,” said Valancy, with a shrug of her shoulders. She\nwas suddenly free of fear again. “I haven’t listened to the gossip of\nDeerwood teaparties and sewing circles twenty years for nothing. But,\nDr. Stalling, it doesn’t matter in the least to me what they say—not in\nthe least.”"

Who\nhated her childhood memories!Then Cousin Georgiana came—on her own initiative, for nobody would have\nthought it worth while to send her. She found Valancy alone, weeding\nthe little vegetable garden she had planted, and she made all the\nplatitudinous pleas she could think of. Valancy heard her patiently.\nCousin Georgiana wasn’t such a bad old soul. Then she said:“And now that you have got all that out of your system, Cousin\nGeorgiana, can you tell me how to make creamed codfish so that it will\nnot be as thick as porridge and as salt as the Dead Sea?”* * * * * * *“We’ll just have to _wait_,” said Uncle Benjamin. “After all, Cissy Gay\ncan’t live long. Dr. Marsh tells me she may drop off any day.”Mrs. Frederick wept. It would really have been so much easier to bear\nif Valancy had died. She could have worn mourning then.CHAPTER XXWhen Abel Gay paid Valancy her first month’s wages—which he did\npromptly, in bills reeking with the odour of tobacco and\nwhiskey—Valancy went into Deerwood and spent every cent of it. She got\na pretty green crêpe dress with a girdle of crimson beads, at a bargain\nsale, a pair of silk stockings, to match, and a little crinkled green\nhat with a crimson rose in it. She even bought a foolish little\nberibboned and belaced nightgown.She passed the house on Elm Street twice—Valancy never even thought\nabout it as “home”—but saw no one. No doubt her mother was sitting in\nthe room this lovely June evening playing solitaire—and cheating.\nValancy knew that Mrs. Frederick always cheated. She never lost a game.\nMost of the people Valancy met looked at her seriously and passed her\nwith a cool nod. Nobody stopped to speak to her."

  "content": "Valancy put on her green dress when she got home. Then she took it off\nagain. She felt so miserably undressed in its low neck and short\nsleeves. And that low, crimson girdle around the hips seemed positively\nindecent. She hung it up in the closet, feeling flatly that she had\nwasted her money. She would never have the courage to wear that dress.\nJohn Foster’s arraignment of fear had no power to stiffen her against\nthis. In this one thing habit and custom were still all-powerful. Yet\nshe sighed as she went down to meet Barney Snaith in her old\nsnuff-brown silk. That green thing had been very becoming—she had seen\nso much in her one ashamed glance. Above it her eyes had looked like\nodd brown jewels and the girdle had given her flat figure an entirely\ndifferent appearance. She wished she could have left it on. But there\nwere some things John Foster did not know.Every Sunday evening Valancy went to the little Free Methodist church\nin a valley on the edge of “up back”—a spireless little grey building\namong the pines, with a few sunken graves and mossy gravestones in the\nsmall, paling-encircled, grass-grown square beside it. She liked the\nminister who preached there. He was so simple and sincere. An old man,\nwho lived in Port Lawrence and came out by the lake in a little\ndisappearing propeller boat to give a free service to the people of the\nsmall, stony farms back of the hills, who would otherwise never have\nheard any gospel message. She liked the simple service and the fervent\nsinging. She liked to sit by the open window and look out into the pine\nwoods. The congregation was always small. The Free Methodists were few\nin number, poor and generally illiterate. But Valancy loved those\nSunday evenings. For the first time in her life she liked going to\nchurch. The rumour reached Deerwood that she had “turned Free\nMethodist” and sent Mrs. Frederick to bed for a day. But Valancy had\nnot turned anything. She went to the church because she liked it and\nbecause in some inexplicable way it did her good. Old Mr. Towers\nbelieved exactly what he preached and somehow it made a tremendous\ndifference.Oddly enough, Roaring Abel disapproved of her going to the hill church\nas strongly as Mrs. Frederick herself could have done. He had “no use\nfor Free Methodists. He was a Presbyterian.” But Valancy went in spite\nof him.“We’ll hear something worse than _that_ about her soon,” Uncle Benjamin\npredicted gloomily.They did.Valancy could not quite explain, even to herself, just why she wanted\nto go to that party. It was a dance “up back” at Chidley Corners; and\ndances at Chidley Corners were not, as a rule, the sort of assemblies\nwhere well-brought-up young ladies were found. Valancy knew it was\ncoming off, for Roaring Abel had been engaged as one of the fiddlers."

You look peaked—you want something to liven\nyou up.”Valancy found herself suddenly wanting to go. She knew nothing at all\nof what dances at Chidley Corners were apt to be like. Her idea of\ndances had been fashioned on the correct affairs that went by that name\nin Deerwood and Port Lawrence. Of course she knew the Corners’ dance\nwouldn’t be just like them. Much more informal, of course. But so much\nthe more interesting. Why shouldn’t she go? Cissy was in a week of\napparent health and improvement. She wouldn’t mind staying alone in the\nleast. She entreated Valancy to go if she wanted to. And Valancy _did_\nwant to go.She went to her room to dress. A rage against the snuff-brown silk\nseized her. Wear that to a party! Never. She pulled her green crêpe\nfrom its hanger and put it on feverishly. It was nonsense to feel\nso—so—naked—just because her neck and arms were bare. That was just her\nold maidishness. She would not be ridden by it. On went the dress—the\nslippers.It was the first time she had worn a pretty dress since the organdies\nof her early teens. And _they_ had never made her look like this.If she only had a necklace or something. She wouldn’t feel so bare\nthen. She ran down to the garden. There were clovers there—great\ncrimson things growing in the long grass. Valancy gathered handfuls of\nthem and strung them on a cord. Fastened above her neck they gave her\nthe comfortable sensation of a collar and were oddly becoming. Another\ncirclet of them went round her hair, dressed in the low puffs that\nbecame her. Excitement brought those faint pink stains to her face. She\nflung on her coat and pulled the little, twisty hat over her hair.“You look so nice and—and—different, dear,” said Cissy. “Like a green\nmoonbeam with a gleam of red in it, if there could be such a thing.”Valancy stooped to kiss her.“I don’t feel right about leaving you alone, Cissy.”"

I never was at a party at\nthe Corners, but I used to go sometimes, long ago, to dances up back.\nWe always had good times. And you needn’t be afraid of Father being\ndrunk tonight. He never drinks when he engages to play for a party.\nBut—there may be—liquor. What will you do if it gets rough?”“Nobody would molest me.”“Not seriously, I suppose. Father would see to that. But it _might_ be\nnoisy and—and unpleasant.”“I won’t mind. I’m only going as a looker-on. I don’t expect to dance.\nI just want to _see_ what a party up back is like. I’ve never seen\nanything except decorous Deerwood.”Cissy smiled rather dubiously. She knew much better than Valancy what a\nparty “up back” might be like if there should be liquor. But again\nthere mightn’t be.“I hope you’ll enjoy it, dear,” she repeated.Valancy enjoyed the drive there. They went early, for it was twelve\nmiles to Chidley Corners, and they had to go in Abel’s old, ragged\ntop-buggy. The road was rough and rocky, like most Muskoka roads, but\nfull of the austere charm of northern woods. It wound through\nbeautiful, purring pines that were ranks of enchantment in the June\nsunset, and over the curious jade-green rivers of Muskoka, fringed by\naspens that were always quivering with some supernal joy.Roaring Abel was excellent company, too. He knew all the stories and\nlegends of the wild, beautiful “up back,” and he told them to Valancy\nas they drove along. Valancy had several fits of inward laughter over\nwhat Uncle Benjamin and Aunt Wellington, _et al._, would feel and think\nand say if they saw her driving with Roaring Abel in that terrible\nbuggy to a dance at Chidley Corners.At first the dance was quiet enough, and Valancy was amused and\nentertained. She even danced twice herself, with a couple of nice “up\nback” boys who danced beautifully and told her she did, too.Another compliment came her way—not a very subtle one, perhaps, but\nValancy had had too few compliments in her life to be over-nice on that\npoint. She overheard two of the “up back” young men talking about her\nin the dark “lean-to” behind her.“Know who that girl in green is?”“Nope. Guess she’s from out front. The Port, maybe. Got a stylish look\nto her.”“No beaut but cute-looking, I’ll say. ‘Jever see such eyes?”"

The “up back” girls were\npretty and prettily dressed. Valancy thought it the nicest party she\nhad ever attended.By eleven o’clock she had changed her mind. A new crowd had arrived—a\ncrowd unmistakably drunk. Whiskey began to circulate freely. Very soon\nalmost all the men were partly drunk. Those in the porch and outside\naround the door began howling “come-all-ye’s” and continued to howl\nthem. The room grew noisy and reeking. Quarrels started up here and\nthere. Bad language and obscene songs were heard. The girls, swung\nrudely in the dances, became dishevelled and tawdry. Valancy, alone in\nher corner, was feeling disgusted and repentant. Why had she ever come\nto such a place? Freedom and independence were all very well, but one\nshould not be a little fool. She might have known what it would be\nlike—she might have taken warning from Cissy’s guarded sentences. Her\nhead was aching—she was sick of the whole thing. But what could she do?\nShe must stay to the end. Abel could not leave till then. And that\nwould probably be not till three or four in the morning.The new influx of boys had left the girls far in the minority and\npartners were scarce. Valancy was pestered with invitations to dance.\nShe refused them all shortly, and some of her refusals were not well\ntaken. There were muttered oaths and sullen looks. Across the room she\nsaw a group of the strangers talking together and glancing meaningly at\nher. What were they plotting?"

Valancy had two distinct\nconvictions—one was that she was quite safe now; the other was that\n_this_ was why she had wanted to come to the dance. It had been such an\nabsurd hope that she had not recognised it before, but now she knew she\nhad come because of the possibility that Barney might be there, too.\nShe thought that perhaps she ought to be ashamed for this, but she\nwasn’t. After her feeling of relief her next feeling was one of\nannoyance with Barney for coming there unshaved. Surely he might have\nenough self-respect to groom himself up decently when he went to a\nparty. There he was, bareheaded, bristly-chinned, in his old trousers\nand his blue homespun shirt. Not even a coat. Valancy could have shaken\nhim in her anger. No wonder people believed everything bad of him.But she was not afraid any longer. One of the whispering group left his\ncomrades and came across the room to her, through the whirling couples\nthat now filled it uncomfortably. He was a tall, broad-shouldered\nfellow, not ill-dressed or ill-looking but unmistakably half drunk. He\nasked Valancy to dance. Valancy declined civilly. His face turned\nlivid. He threw his arm about her and pulled her to him. His hot,\nwhiskied breath burned her face.“We won’t have fine-lady airs here, my girl. If you ain’t too good to\ncome here you ain’t too good to dance with us. Me and my pals have been\nwatching you. You’ve got to give us each a turn and a kiss to boot.”Valancy tried desperately and vainly to free herself. She was being\ndragged out into the maze of shouting, stamping, yelling dancers. The\nnext moment the man who held her went staggering across the room from a\nneatly planted blow on the jaw, knocking down whirling couples as he\nwent. Valancy felt her arm grasped.“This way—quick,” said Barney Snaith. He swung her out through the open\nwindow behind them, vaulted lightly over the sill and caught her hand.“Quick—we must run for it—they’ll be after us.”Valancy ran as she had never run before, clinging tight to Barney’s\nhand, wondering why she did not drop dead in such a mad scamper.\nSuppose she did! What a scandal it would make for her poor people. For\nthe first time Valancy felt a little sorry for them. Also, she felt\nglad that she had escaped from that horrible row. Also, glad that she\nwas holding tight to Barney’s hand. Her feelings were badly mixed and\nshe had never had so many in such a brief time in her life.They finally reached a quiet corner in the pine woods. The pursuit had\ntaken a different direction and the whoops and yells behind them were\ngrowing faint. Valancy, out of breath, with a crazily beating heart,\ncollapsed on the trunk of a fallen pine.“Thanks,” she gasped.“What a goose you were to come to such a place!” said Barney."

Chidley Corners!”“It—was—just—a name—to me.”Valancy knew Barney could not realise how ignorant she was of the\nregions “up back.” She had lived in Deerwood all her life and of course\nhe supposed she knew. He didn’t know how she had been brought up. There\nwas no use trying to explain.“When I drifted in at Abel’s this evening and Cissy told me you’d come\nhere I was amazed. And downright scared. Cissy told me she was worried\nabout you but hadn’t liked to say anything to dissuade you for fear\nyou’d think she was thinking selfishly about herself. So I came on up\nhere instead of going to Deerwood.”Valancy felt a sudden delightful glow irradiating soul and body under\nthe dark pines. So he had actually come up to look after her.“As soon as they stop hunting for us we’ll sneak around to the Muskoka\nroad. I left Lady Jane down there. I’ll take you home. I suppose you’ve\nhad enough of your party.”“Quite,” said Valancy meekly. The first half of the way home neither of\nthem said anything. It would not have been much use. Lady Jane made so\nmuch noise they could not have heard each other. Anyway, Valancy did\nnot feel conversationally inclined. She was ashamed of the whole\naffair—ashamed of her folly in going—ashamed of being found in such a\nplace by Barney Snaith. By Barney Snaith, reputed jail-breaker,\ninfidel, forger and defaulter. Valancy’s lips twitched in the darkness\nas she thought of it. But she _was_ ashamed."
