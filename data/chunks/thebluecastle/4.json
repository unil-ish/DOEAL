  "content": "Valancy was perfectly happy. Some things dawn on you slowly. Some\nthings come by lightning flashes. Valancy had had a lightning flash.She knew quite well now that she loved Barney. Yesterday she had been\nall her own. Now she was this man’s. Yet he had done nothing—said\nnothing. He had not even looked at her as a woman. But that didn’t\nmatter. Nor did it matter what he was or what he had done. She loved\nhim without any reservations. Everything in her went out wholly to him.\nShe had no wish to stifle or disown her love. She seemed to be his so\nabsolutely that thought apart from him—thought in which he did not\npredominate—was an impossibility.She had realised, quite simply and fully, that she loved him, in the\nmoment when he was leaning on the car door, explaining that Lady Jane\nhad no gas. She had looked deep into his eyes in the moonlight and had\nknown. In just that infinitesimal space of time everything was changed.\nOld things passed away and all things became new.She was no longer unimportant, little, old maid Valancy Stirling. She\nwas a woman, full of love and therefore rich and significant—justified\nto herself. Life was no longer empty and futile, and death could cheat\nher of nothing. Love had cast out her last fear.Love! What a searing, torturing, intolerably sweet thing it was—this\npossession of body, soul and mind! With something at its core as fine\nand remote and purely spiritual as the tiny blue spark in the heart of\nthe unbreakable diamond. No dream had ever been like this. She was no\nlonger solitary. She was one of a vast sisterhood—all the women who had\never loved in the world."

  "content": "Barney need never know it—though she would not in the least have minded\nhis knowing. But _she_ knew it and it made a tremendous difference to\nher. Just to love! She did not ask to be loved. It was rapture enough\njust to sit there beside him in silence, alone in the summer night in\nthe white splendour of moonshine, with the wind blowing down on them\nout of the pine woods. She had always envied the wind. So free. Blowing\nwhere it listed. Through the hills. Over the lakes. What a tang, what a\nzip it had! What a magic of adventure! Valancy felt as if she had\nexchanged her shop-worn soul for a fresh one, fire-new from the\nworkshop of the gods. As far back as she could look, life had been\ndull—colourless—savourless. Now she had come to a little patch of\nviolets, purple and fragrant—hers for the plucking. No matter who or\nwhat had been in Barney’s past—no matter who or what might be in his\nfuture—no one else could ever have this perfect hour. She surrendered\nherself utterly to the charm of the moment.“Ever dream of ballooning?” said Barney suddenly.“No,” said Valancy.“I do—often. Dream of sailing through the clouds—seeing the glories of\nsunset—spending hours in the midst of a terrific storm with lightning\nplaying above and below you—skimming above a silver cloud floor under a\nfull moon—wonderful!”“It does sound so,” said Valancy. “I’ve stayed on earth in my dreams.”She told him about her Blue Castle. It was so easy to tell Barney\nthings. One felt he understood everything—even the things you didn’t\ntell him. And then she told him a little of her existence before she\ncame to Roaring Abel’s. She wanted him to see why she had gone to the\ndance “up back.”“You see—I’ve never had any real life,” she said. “I’ve just—breathed.\nEvery door has always been shut to me.”“But you’re still young,” said Barney.“Oh, I know. Yes, I’m ‘still young’—but that’s so different from\n_young_,” said Valancy bitterly. For a moment she was tempted to tell\nBarney why her years had nothing to do with her future; but she did\nnot. She was not going to think of death tonight.“Though I never was really young,” she went on—“until tonight,” she\nadded in her heart. “I never had a life like other girls. You couldn’t\nunderstand. Why,”—she had a desperate desire that Barney should know\nthe worst about her—“I didn’t even love my mother. Isn’t it awful that\nI don’t love my mother?”“Rather awful—for her,” said Barney drily.“Oh, she didn’t know it. She took my love for granted. And I wasn’t any\nuse or comfort to her or anybody. I was just a—a—vegetable. And I got\ntired of it. That’s why I came to keep house for Mr. Gay and look after\nCissy.”“And I suppose your people thought you’d gone mad.”“They did—and do—literally,” said Valancy. “But it’s a comfort to them.\nThey’d rather believe me mad than bad. There’s no other alternative.\nBut I’ve been _living_ since I came to Mr. Gay’s. It’s been a\ndelightful experience. I suppose I’ll pay for it when I have to go\nback—but I’ll have _had_ it.”"

  "content": "“That’s true,” said Barney. “If you buy your experience it’s your own.\nSo it’s no matter how much you pay for it. Somebody else’s experience\ncan never be yours. Well, it’s a funny old world.”“Do you think it really is old?” asked Valancy dreamily. “I never\nbelieve _that_ in June. It seems so young tonight—somehow. In that\nquivering moonlight—like a young, white girl—waiting.”“Moonlight here on the verge of up back is different from moonlight\nanywhere else,” agreed Barney. “It always makes me feel so clean,\nsomehow—body and soul. And of course the age of gold always comes back\nin spring.”It was ten o’clock now. A dragon of black cloud ate up the moon. The\nspring air grew chill—Valancy shivered. Barney reached back into the\ninnards of Lady Jane and clawed up an old, tobacco-scented overcoat.“Put that on,” he ordered.“Don’t you want it yourself?” protested Valancy.“No. I’m not going to have you catching cold on my hands.”“Oh, I won’t catch cold. I haven’t had a cold since I came to Mr.\nGay’s—though I’ve done the foolishest things. It’s funny, too—I used to\nhave them all the time. I feel so selfish taking your coat.”“You’ve sneezed three times. No use winding up your ‘experience’ up\nback with grippe or pneumonia.”He pulled it up tight about her throat and buttoned it on her. Valancy\nsubmitted with secret delight. How nice it was to have some one look\nafter you so! She snuggled down into the tobaccoey folds and wished the\nnight could last forever.Ten minutes later a car swooped down on them from “up back.” Barney\nsprang from Lady Jane and waved his hand. The car came to a stop beside\nthem. Valancy saw Uncle Wellington and Olive gazing at her in horror\nfrom it.So Uncle Wellington had got a car! And he must have been spending the\nevening up at Mistawis with Cousin Herbert. Valancy almost laughed\naloud at the expression on his face as he recognised her. The pompous,\nbewhiskered old humbug!“Can you let me have enough gas to take me to Deerwood?” Barney was\nasking politely. But Uncle Wellington was not attending to him.“Valancy, how came you _here_!” he said sternly.“By chance or God’s grace,” said Valancy."

  "content": "“With this jail-bird—at ten o’clock at night!” said Uncle Wellington.Valancy turned to Barney. The moon had escaped from its dragon and in\nits light her eyes were full of deviltry.“_Are_ you a jail-bird?”“Does it matter?” said Barney, gleams of fun in _his_ eyes.“Not to me. I only asked out of curiosity,” continued Valancy.“Then I won’t tell you. I never satisfy curiosity.” He turned to Uncle\nWellington and his voice changed subtly.“Mr. Stirling, I asked you if you could let me have some gas. If you\ncan, well and good. If not, we are only delaying you unnecessarily.”Uncle Wellington was in a horrible dilemma. To give gas to this\nshameless pair! But not to give it to them! To go away and leave them\nthere in the Mistawis woods—until daylight, likely. It was better to\ngive it to them and let them get out of sight before any one else saw\nthem.“Got anything to get gas in?” he grunted surlily.Barney produced a two-gallon measure from Lady Jane. The two men went\nto the rear of the Stirling car and began manipulating the tap. Valancy\nstole sly glances at Olive over the collar of Barney’s coat. Olive was\nsitting grimly staring straight ahead with an outraged expression. She\ndid not mean to take any notice of Valancy. Olive had her own secret\nreasons for feeling outraged. Cecil had been in Deerwood lately and of\ncourse had heard all about Valancy. He agreed that her mind was\nderanged and was exceedingly anxious to find out whence the derangement\nhad been inherited. It was a serious thing to have in the family—a very\nserious thing. One had to think of one’s—descendants.“She got it from the Wansbarras,” said Olive positively. “There’s\nnothing like that in the Stirlings—nothing!”“I hope not—I certainly hope not,” Cecil had responded dubiously. “But\nthen—to go out as a servant—for that is what it practically amounts to.\nYour cousin!”Poor Olive felt the implication. The Port Lawrence Prices were not\naccustomed to ally themselves with families whose members “worked out.”Valancy could not resist temptation. She leaned forward.“Olive, does it hurt?”"

  "content": "Olive bit—stiffly.“Does _what_ hurt?”“Looking like that.”For a moment Olive resolved she would take no further notice of\nValancy. Then duty came uppermost. She must not miss the opportunity.“Doss,” she implored, leaning forward also, “won’t you come home—come\nhome tonight?”Valancy yawned.“You sound like a revival meeting,” she said. “You really do.”“If you will come back——”“All will be forgiven.”“Yes,” said Olive eagerly. Wouldn’t it be splendid if _she_ could\ninduce the prodigal daughter to return? “We’ll never cast it up to you.\nDoss, there are nights when I cannot sleep for thinking of you.”“And me having the time of my life,” said Valancy, laughing.“Doss, I can’t believe you’re bad. I’ve always said you couldn’t be\nbad——”“I don’t believe I can be,” said Valancy. “I’m afraid I’m hopelessly\nproper. I’ve been sitting here for three hours with Barney Snaith and\nhe hasn’t even tried to kiss me. I wouldn’t have minded if he had,\nOlive.”Valancy was still leaning forward. Her little hat with its crimson rose\nwas tilted down over one eye. Olive stared. In the moonlight Valancy’s\neyes—Valancy’s smile—what had happened to Valancy! She looked—not\npretty—Doss couldn’t be pretty—but provocative, fascinating—yes,\nabominably so. Olive drew back. It was beneath her dignity to say more.\nAfter all, Valancy must be both mad _and_ bad.“Thanks—that’s enough,” said Barney behind the car. “Much obliged, Mr.\nStirling. Two gallons—seventy cents. Thank you.”Uncle Wellington climbed foolishly and feebly into his car. He wanted\nto give Snaith a piece of his mind, but dared not. Who knew what the\ncreature might do if provoked? No doubt he carried firearms.Uncle Wellington looked indecisively at Valancy. But Valancy had turned\nher back on him and was watching Barney pour the gas into Lady Jane’s\nmaw.“Drive on,” said Olive decisively. “There’s no use in waiting here. Let\nme tell you what she said to me.”“The little hussy! The shameless little hussy!” said Uncle Wellington.CHAPTER XXII"

  "content": "The next thing the Stirlings heard was that Valancy had been seen with\nBarney Snaith in a movie theatre in Port Lawrence and after it at\nsupper in a Chinese restaurant there. This was quite true—and no one\nwas more surprised at it than Valancy herself. Barney had come along in\nLady Jane one dim twilight and told Valancy unceremoniously if she\nwanted a drive to hop in.“I’m going to the Port. Will you go there with me?”His eyes were teasing and there was a bit of defiance in his voice.\nValancy, who did not conceal from herself that she would have gone\nanywhere with him to any place, “hopped in” without more ado. They tore\ninto and through Deerwood. Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles, taking a\nlittle air on the verandah, saw them whirl by in a cloud of dust and\nsought comfort in each other’s eyes. Valancy, who in some dim\npre-existence had been afraid of a car, was hatless and her hair was\nblowing wildly round her face. She would certainly come down with\nbronchitis—and die at Roaring Abel’s. She wore a low-necked dress and\nher arms were bare. That Snaith creature was in his shirt-sleeves,\nsmoking a pipe. They were going at the rate of forty miles an\nhour—sixty, Cousin Stickles averred. Lady Jane could hit the pike when\nshe wanted to. Valancy waved her hand gaily to her relatives. As for\nMrs. Frederick, she was wishing she knew how to go into hysterics.“Was it for this,” she demanded in hollow tones, “that I suffered the\npangs of motherhood?”“I will not believe,” said Cousin Stickles solemnly, “that our prayers\nwill not yet be answered.”“Who—_who_ will protect that unfortunate girl when I am gone?” moaned\nMrs. Frederick.As for Valancy, she was wondering if it could really be only a few\nweeks since she had sat there with them on that verandah. Hating the\nrubber-plant. Pestered with teasing questions like black flies. Always\nthinking of appearances. Cowed because of Aunt Wellington’s teaspoons\nand Uncle Benjamin’s money. Poverty-stricken. Afraid of everybody.\nEnvying Olive. A slave to moth-eaten traditions. Nothing to hope for or\nexpect.And now every day was a gay adventure."

  "content": "Lady Jane flew over the fifteen miles between Deerwood and the\nPort—through the Port. The way Barney went past traffic policemen was\nnot holy. The lights were beginning to twinkle out like stars in the\nclear, lemon-hued twilight air. This was the only time Valancy ever\nreally liked the town, and she was crazy with the delight of speeding.\nWas it possible she had ever been afraid of a car? She was perfectly\nhappy, riding beside Barney. Not that she deluded herself into thinking\nit had any significance. She knew quite well that Barney had asked her\nto go on the impulse of the moment—an impulse born of a feeling of pity\nfor her and her starved little dreams. She was looking tired after a\nwakeful night with a heart attack, followed by a busy day. She had so\nlittle fun. He’d give her an outing for once. Besides, Abel was in the\nkitchen, at the point of drunkenness where he was declaring he did not\nbelieve in God and beginning to sing ribald songs. It was just as well\nshe should be out of the way for a while. Barney knew Roaring Abel’s\nrepertoire.They went to the movie—Valancy had never been to a movie. And then,\nfinding a nice hunger upon them, they went and had fried\nchicken—unbelievably delicious—in the Chinese restaurant. After which\nthey rattled home again, leaving a devastating trail of scandal behind\nthem. Mrs. Frederick gave up going to church altogether. She could not\nendure her friends’ pitying glances and questions. But Cousin Stickles\nwent every Sunday. She said they had been given a cross to bear.CHAPTER XXIIIOn one of Cissy’s wakeful nights, she told Valancy her poor little\nstory. They were sitting by the open window. Cissy could not get her\nbreath lying down that night. An inglorious gibbous moon was hanging\nover the wooded hills and in its spectral light Cissy looked frail and\nlovely and incredibly young. A child. It did not seem possible that she\ncould have lived through all the passion and pain and shame of her\nstory.“He was stopping at the hotel across the lake. He used to come over in\nhis canoe at night—we met in the pines down the shore. He was a young\ncollege student—his father was a rich man in Toronto. Oh, Valancy, I\ndidn’t mean to be bad—I didn’t, indeed. But I loved him so—I love him\nyet—I’ll always love him. And I—didn’t know—some things. I\ndidn’t—understand. Then his father came and took him away. And—after a\nlittle—I found out—oh, Valancy,—I was so frightened. I didn’t know what\nto do. I wrote him—and he came. He—he said he would marry me, Valancy.”“And why—and why?——”“Oh, Valancy, he didn’t love me any more. I saw that at a glance. He—he\nwas just offering to marry me because he thought he ought to—because he\nwas sorry for me. He wasn’t bad—but he was so young—and what was I that\nhe should keep on loving me?”“Never mind making excuses for him,” said Valancy a bit shortly. “So\nyou wouldn’t marry him?”"

Do you think I did right, Valancy?”“Yes, I do. _You_ did right. But he——”“Don’t blame him, dear. Please don’t. Let’s not talk about him at all.\nThere’s no need. I wanted to tell you how it was—I didn’t want you to\nthink me bad——”“I never did think so.”“Yes, I felt that—whenever you came. Oh, Valancy, what you’ve been to\nme! I can never tell you—but God will bless you for it. I know He\nwill—‘with what measure ye mete.’”Cissy sobbed for a few minutes in Valancy’s arms. Then she wiped her\neyes.“Well, that’s almost all. I came home. I wasn’t really so very unhappy.\nI suppose I should have been—but I wasn’t. Father wasn’t hard on me.\nAnd my baby was so sweet while he lived. I was even happy—I loved him\nso much, the dear little thing. He was so sweet, Valancy—with such\nlovely blue eyes—and little rings of pale gold hair like silk floss—and\ntiny dimpled hands. I used to bite his satin-smooth little face all\nover—softly, so as not to hurt him, you know——”“I know,” said Valancy, wincing. “I know—a woman _always_ knows—and\ndreams——”“And he was _all_ mine. Nobody else had any claim on him. When he died,\noh, Valancy, I thought I must die too—I didn’t see how anybody could\nendure such anguish and live. To see his dear little eyes and know he\nwould never open them again—to miss his warm little body nestled\nagainst mine at night and think of him sleeping alone and cold, his wee\nface under the hard frozen earth. It was so awful for the first\nyear—after that it was a little easier, one didn’t keep thinking ‘this\nday last year’—but I was so glad when I found out I was dying.”“‘Who could endure life if it were not for the hope of death?’”\nmurmured Valancy softly—it was of course a quotation from some book of\nJohn Foster’s.“I’m glad I’ve told you all about it,” sighed Cissy. “I wanted you to\nknow.”Cissy died a few nights after that. Roaring Abel was away. When Valancy\nsaw the change that had come over Cissy’s face she wanted to telephone\nfor the doctor. But Cissy wouldn’t let her."

She fell asleep\nwhen it was over, still holding to Valancy’s hand. Valancy sat there in\nthe silence. She was not frightened—or even sorry. At sunrise Cissy\ndied. She opened her eyes and looked past Valancy at\nsomething—something that made her smile suddenly and happily. And,\nsmiling, she died.Valancy crossed Cissy’s hands on her breast and went to the open\nwindow. In the eastern sky, amid the fires of sunrise, an old moon was\nhanging—as slender and lovely as a new moon. Valancy had never seen an\nold, old moon before. She watched it pale and fade until it paled and\nfaded out of sight in the living rose of day. A little pool in the\nbarrens shone in the sunrise like a great golden lily.But the world suddenly seemed a colder place to Valancy. Again nobody\nneeded her. She was not in the least sorry Cecilia was dead. She was\nonly sorry for all her suffering in life. But nobody could ever hurt\nher again. Valancy had always thought death dreadful. But Cissy had\ndied so quietly—so pleasantly. And at the very last—something—had made\nup to her for everything. She was lying there now, in her white sleep,\nlooking like a child. Beautiful! All the lines of shame and pain gone.Roaring Abel drove in, justifying his name. Valancy went down and told\nhim. The shock sobered him at once. He slumped down on the seat of his\nbuggy, his great head hanging.“Cissy dead—Cissy dead,” he said vacantly. “I didn’t think it would ‘a’\ncome so soon. Dead. She used to run down the lane to meet me with a\nlittle white rose stuck in her hair. Cissy used to be a pretty little\ngirl. And a good little girl.”“She has always been a good little girl,” said Valancy.CHAPTER XXIV"

  "content": "Valancy herself made Cissy ready for burial. No hands but hers should\ntouch that pitiful, wasted little body. The old house was spotless on\nthe day of the funeral. Barney Snaith was not there. He had done all he\ncould to help Valancy before it—he had shrouded the pale Cecilia in\nwhite roses from the garden—and then had gone back to his island. But\neverybody else was there. All Deerwood and “up back” came. They forgave\nCissy splendidly at last. Mr. Bradly gave a very beautiful funeral\naddress. Valancy had wanted her old Free Methodist man, but Roaring\nAbel was obdurate. He was a Presbyterian and no one but a Presbyterian\nminister should bury _his_ daughter. Mr. Bradly was very tactful. He\navoided all dubious points and it was plain to be seen he hoped for the\nbest. Six reputable citizens of Deerwood bore Cecilia Gay to her grave\nin decorous Deerwood cemetery. Among them was Uncle Wellington.The Stirlings all came to the funeral, men and women. They had had a\nfamily conclave over it. Surely now that Cissy Gay was dead Valancy\nwould come home. She simply could not stay there with Roaring Abel.\nThat being the case, the wisest course—decreed Uncle James—was to\nattend the funeral—legitimise the whole thing, so to speak—show\nDeerwood that Valancy had really done a most creditable deed in going\nto nurse poor Cecilia Gay and that her family backed her up in it.\nDeath, the miracle worker, suddenly made the thing quite respectable.\nIf Valancy would return to home and decency while public opinion was\nunder its influence all might yet be well. Society was suddenly\nforgetting all Cecilia’s wicked doings and remembering what a pretty,\nmodest little thing she had been—“and motherless, you know—motherless!”\nIt was the psychological moment—said Uncle James.So the Stirlings went to the funeral. Even Cousin Gladys’ neuritis\nallowed her to come. Cousin Stickles was there, her bonnet dripping all\nover her face, crying as woefully as if Cissy had been her nearest and\ndearest. Funerals always brought Cousin Stickles’ “own sad bereavement”\nback.And Uncle Wellington was a pall-bearer."

  "content": "Valancy, pale, subdued-looking, her slanted eyes smudged with purple,\nin her snuff-brown dress, moving quietly about, finding seats for\npeople, consulting in undertones with minister and undertaker,\nmarshalling the “mourners” into the parlour, was so decorous and proper\nand Stirlingish that her family took heart of grace. This was not—could\nnot be—the girl who had sat all night in the woods with Barney\nSnaith—who had gone tearing bareheaded through Deerwood and Port\nLawrence. This was the Valancy they knew. Really, surprisingly capable\nand efficient. Perhaps she had always been kept down a bit too\nmuch—Amelia really was rather strict—hadn’t had a chance to show what\nwas in her. So thought the Stirlings. And Edward Beck, from the Port\nroad, a widower with a large family who was beginning to take notice,\ntook notice of Valancy and thought she might make a mighty fine second\nwife. No beauty—but a fifty-year-old widower, Mr. Beck told himself\nvery reasonably, couldn’t expect everything. Altogether, it seemed that\nValancy’s matrimonial chances were never so bright as they were at\nCecilia Gay’s funeral.What the Stirlings and Edward Beck would have thought had they known\nthe back of Valancy’s mind must be left to the imagination. Valancy was\nhating the funeral—hating the people who came to stare with curiosity\nat Cecilia’s marble-white face—hating the smugness—hating the dragging,\nmelancholy singing—hating Mr. Bradly’s cautious platitudes. If she\ncould have had her absurd way, there would have been no funeral at all.\nShe would have covered Cissy over with flowers, shut her away from\nprying eyes, and buried her beside her nameless little baby in the\ngrassy burying-ground under the pines of the “up back” church, with a\nbit of kindly prayer from the old Free Methodist minister. She\nremembered Cissy saying once, “I wish I could be buried deep in the\nheart of the woods where nobody would ever come to say, ‘Cissy Gay is\nburied here,’ and tell over my miserable story.”But this! However, it would soon be over. Valancy knew, if the\nStirlings and Edward Beck didn’t, exactly what she intended to do then.\nShe had lain awake all the preceding night thinking about it and\nfinally deciding on it.When the funeral procession had left the house, Mrs. Frederick sought\nout Valancy in the kitchen.“My child,” she said tremulously, “you’ll come home _now_?”“Home,” said Valancy absently. She was getting on an apron and\ncalculating how much tea she must put to steep for supper. There would\nbe several guests from “up back”—distant relatives of the Gays’ who had\nnot remembered them for years. And she was so tired she wished she\ncould borrow a pair of legs from the cat.“Yes, home,” said Mrs. Frederick, with a touch of asperity. “I suppose\nyou won’t dream of staying here _now_—alone with Roaring Abel.”“Oh, no, I’m not going to stay _here_,” said Valancy. “Of course, I’ll\nhave to stay for a day or two, to put the house in order generally. But\nthat will be all. Excuse me, Mother, won’t you? I’ve a frightful lot to\ndo—all those “up back” people will be here to supper.”"

Before he went, Valancy told him she would be going away the\nnext day. Roaring Abel was sorry, and said so. A distant cousin from\n“up back” was coming to keep house for him—quite willing to do so now\nsince there was no sick girl to wait on—but Abel was not under any\ndelusions concerning her.“She won’t be like you, my girl. Well, I’m obliged to you. You helped\nme out of a bad hole and I won’t forget it. And I won’t forget what you\ndid for Cissy. I’m your friend, and if you ever want any of the\nStirlings spanked and sot in a corner send for me. I’m going to wet my\nwhistle. Lord, but I’m dry! Don’t reckon I’ll be back afore tomorrow\nnight, so if you’re going home tomorrow, good-bye now.”“I _may_ go home tomorrow,” said Valancy, “but I’m not going back to\nDeerwood.”“Not going——”“You’ll find the key on the woodshed nail,” interrupted Valancy,\npolitely and unmistakably. “The dog will be in the barn and the cat in\nthe cellar. Don’t forget to feed her till your cousin comes. The pantry\nis full and I made bread and pies today. Good-bye, Mr. Gay. You have\nbeen very kind to me and I appreciate it.”“We’ve had a d——d decent time of it together, and that’s a fact,” said\nRoaring Abel. “You’re the best small sport in the world, and your\nlittle finger is worth the whole Stirling clan tied together. Good-bye\nand good-luck.”"

The garden was lying in the magic of the warm, odorous July\ntwilight. A few stars were out and the robins were calling through the\nvelvety silences of the barrens. Valancy stood by the gate expectantly.\nWould he come? If he did not——He was coming. Valancy heard Lady Jane Grey far back in the woods. Her\nbreath came a little more quickly. Nearer—and nearer—she could see Lady\nJane now—bumping down the lane—nearer—nearer—he was there—he had sprung\nfrom the car and was leaning over the gate, looking at her.“Going home, Miss Stirling?”“I don’t know—yet,” said Valancy slowly. Her mind was made up, with no\nshadow of turning, but the moment was very tremendous.“I thought I’d run down and ask if there was anything I could do for\nyou,” said Barney.Valancy took it with a canter.“Yes, there is something you can do for me,” she said, evenly and\ndistinctly. “Will you marry me?”For a moment Barney was silent. There was no particular expression on\nhis face. Then he gave an odd laugh.“Come, now! I knew luck was just waiting around the corner for me. All\nthe signs have been pointing that way today.”“Wait.” Valancy lifted her hand. “I’m in earnest—but I want to get my\nbreath after that question. Of course, with my bringing up, I realise\nperfectly well that this is one of the things ‘a lady should not do.’”“But why—why?”“For two reasons.” Valancy was still a little breathless, but she\nlooked Barney straight in the eyes, while all the dead Stirlings\nrevolved rapidly in their graves and the living ones did nothing\nbecause they did not know that Valancy was at that moment proposing\nlawful marriage to the notorious Barney Snaith. “The first reason is,\nI—I”—Valancy tried to say “I love you” but could not. She had to take\nrefuge in a pretended flippancy. “I’m crazy about you. The second\nis—this.”She handed him Dr. Trent’s letter.Barney opened it with the air of a man thankful to find some safe, sane\nthing to do. As he read it his face changed. He understood—more perhaps\nthan Valancy wanted him to.“Are you sure nothing can be done for you?”Valancy did not misunderstand the question."

I can’t go back to Deerwood—you know what my life was like\nthere. And”—she managed it this time—“I love you. I want to spend the\nrest of my life with you. That’s all.”Barney folded his arms on the gate and looked gravely enough at a\nwhite, saucy star that was winking at him just over Roaring Abel’s\nkitchen chimney.“You don’t know anything about me. I may be a—murderer.”“No, I don’t. You _may_ be something dreadful. Everything they say of\nyou may be true. But it doesn’t matter to me.”“You care that much for me, Valancy?” said Barney incredulously,\nlooking away from the star and into her eyes—her strange, mysterious\neyes.“I care—that much,” said Valancy in a low voice. She was trembling. He\nhad called her by her name for the first time. It was sweeter than\nanother man’s caress could have been just to hear him say her name like\nthat.“If we are going to get married,” said Barney, speaking suddenly in a\ncasual, matter-of-fact voice, “some things must be understood.”“Everything must be understood,” said Valancy.“I have things I want to hide,” said Barney coolly. “You are not to ask\nme about them.”“I won’t,” said Valancy.“You must never ask to see my mail.”“Never.”“And we are never to pretend anything to each other.”“We won’t,” said Valancy. “You won’t even have to pretend you like me.\nIf you marry me I know you’re only doing it out of pity.”“And we’ll never tell a lie to each other about anything—a big lie or a\npetty lie.”“Especially a petty lie,” agreed Valancy.“And you’ll have to live back on my island. I won’t live anywhere\nelse.”“That’s partly why I want to marry you,” said Valancy.Barney peered at her.“I believe you mean it. Well—let’s get married, then.”“Thank you,” said Valancy, with a sudden return of primness. She would\nhave been much less embarrassed if he had refused her."

I have explained\neverything in it. If I drop dead suddenly—as I likely will do——”“It will exonerate me in the eyes of your kindred from the suspicion of\nhaving poisoned you,” said Barney with a grin.“Exactly.” Valancy laughed gaily. “Dear me, I’m glad this is over. It\nhas been—a bit of an ordeal. You see, I’m not in the habit of going\nabout asking men to marry me. It is so nice of you not to refuse me—or\noffer to be a brother!”“I’ll go to the Port tomorrow and get a license. We can be married\ntomorrow evening. Dr. Stalling, I suppose?”“Heavens, no.” Valancy shuddered. “Besides, he wouldn’t do it. He’d\nshake his forefinger at me and I’d jilt you at the altar. No, I want my\nold Mr. Towers to marry me.”“Will you marry me as I stand?” demanded Barney. A passing car, full of\ntourists, honked loudly—it seemed derisively. Valancy looked at him.\nBlue homespun shirt, nondescript hat, muddy overalls. Unshaved!“Yes,” she said.Barney put his hands over the gate and took her little, cold ones\ngently in his.“Valancy,” he said, trying to speak lightly, “of course I’m not in love\nwith you—never thought of such a thing as being in love. But, do you\nknow, I’ve always thought you were a bit of a dear.”CHAPTER XXVIThe next day passed for Valancy like a dream. She could not make\nherself or anything she did seem real. She saw nothing of Barney,\nthough she expected he must go rattling past on his way to the Port for\na license.Perhaps he had changed his mind.But at dusk the lights of Lady Jane suddenly swooped over the crest of\nthe wooded hill beyond the lane. Valancy was waiting at the gate for\nher bridegroom. She wore her green dress and her green hat because she\nhad nothing else to wear. She did not look or feel at all\nbride-like—she really looked like a wild elf strayed out of the\ngreenwood. But that did not matter. Nothing at all mattered except that\nBarney was coming for her.“Ready?” said Barney, stopping Lady Jane with some new, horrible\nnoises."

But he had a pair of\noddly smart boots on under his shabby overalls. And he was shaved. They\nclattered into Deerwood and through Deerwood and hit the long, wooded\nroad to the Port.“Haven’t changed your mind?” said Barney.“No. Have you?”“No.”That was their whole conversation on the fifteen miles. Everything was\nmore dream-like than ever. Valancy didn’t know whether she felt happy.\nOr terrified. Or just plain fool.Then the lights of Port Lawrence were about them. Valancy felt as if\nshe were surrounded by the gleaming, hungry eyes of hundreds of great,\nstealthy panthers. Barney briefly asked where Mr. Towers lived, and\nValancy as briefly told him. They stopped before the shabby little\nhouse in an unfashionable street. They went in to the small, shabby\nparlour. Barney produced his license. So he _had_ got it. Also a ring.\nThis thing was real. She, Valancy Stirling, was actually on the point\nof being married.They were standing up together before Mr. Towers. Valancy heard Mr.\nTowers and Barney saying things. She heard some other person saying\nthings. She herself was thinking of the way she had once planned to be\nmarried—away back in her early teens when such a thing had not seemed\nimpossible. White silk and tulle veil and orange-blossoms; no\nbridesmaid. But one flower girl, in a frock of cream shadow lace over\npale pink, with a wreath of flowers in her hair, carrying a basket of\nroses and lilies-of-the-valley. And the groom, a noble-looking\ncreature, irreproachably clad in whatever the fashion of the day\ndecreed. Valancy lifted her eyes and saw herself and Barney in the\nlittle, slanting, distorting mirror over the mantelpiece. She in her\nodd, unbridal green hat and dress; Barney in shirt and overalls. But it\nwas Barney. That was all that mattered. No veil—no flowers—no guests—no\npresents—no wedding-cake—but just Barney. For all the rest of her life\nthere would be Barney.“Mrs. Snaith, I hope you will be very happy,” Mr. Towers was saying."

He did not know Barney Snaith was a\nfugitive from justice. Really, he was an incredibly ignorant old man.\nTherefore he married them and gave them his blessing very gently and\nsolemnly and prayed for them that night after they had gone away. His\nconscience did not trouble him at all.“What a nice way to get married!” Barney was saying as he put Lady Jane\nin gear. “No fuss and flub-dub. I never supposed it was half so easy.”“For heaven’s sake,” said Valancy suddenly, “let’s forget we _are_\nmarried and talk as if we weren’t. I can’t stand another drive like the\none we had coming in.”Barney howled and threw Lady Jane into high with an infernal noise.“And I thought I was making it easy for you,” he said. “You didn’t seem\nto want to talk.”“I didn’t. But I wanted you to talk. I don’t want you to make love to\nme, but I want you to act like an ordinary human being. Tell me about\nthis island of yours. What sort of a place is it?”“The jolliest place in the world. You’re going to love it. The first\ntime I saw it I loved it. Old Tom MacMurray owned it then. He built the\nlittle shack on it, lived there in winter and rented it to Toronto\npeople in summer. I bought it from him—became by that one simple\ntransaction a landed proprietor owning a house and an island. There is\nsomething so satisfying in owning a whole island. And isn’t an\nuninhabited island a charming idea? I’d wanted to own one ever since\nI’d read _Robinson Crusoe_. It seemed too good to be true. And beauty!\nMost of the scenery belongs to the government, but they don’t tax you\nfor looking at it, and the moon belongs to everybody. You won’t find my\nshack very tidy. I suppose you’ll want to make it tidy.”“Yes,” said Valancy honestly. “I _have_ to be tidy. I don’t really\n_want_ to be. But untidiness hurts me. Yes, I’ll have to tidy up your\nshack.”“I was prepared for that,” said Barney, with a hollow groan.“But,” continued Valancy relentingly, “I won’t insist on your wiping\nyour feet when you come in.”“No, you’ll only sweep up after me with the air of a martyr,” said\nBarney. “Well, anyway, you can’t tidy the lean-to. You can’t even enter\nit. The door will be locked and I shall keep the key.”"

Otherwise, finding that she had disappeared from\nRoaring Abel’s, they might get out a search warrant for her. Barney had\noffered to drive her in, but she had preferred to go alone. She smiled\nvery radiantly at Cousin Georgiana, who, she remembered, as of some one\nknown a long time ago, had really been not a bad little creature.\nValancy was so happy that she could have smiled at anybody—even Uncle\nJames. She was not averse to Cousin Georgiana’s company. Already, since\nthe houses along the road were becoming numerous, she was conscious\nthat curious eyes were looking at her from every window.“I suppose you’re going home, dear Doss?” said Cousin Georgiana as she\nshook hands—furtively eyeing Valancy’s dress and wondering if she had\n_any_ petticoat on at all.“Sooner or later,” said Valancy cryptically.“Then I’ll go along with you. I’ve been wanting to see you very\nespecially, Doss dear. I’ve something quite _wonderful_ to tell you.”“Yes?” said Valancy absently.

And _was_ Cousin Georgiana blushing?“Who on earth is Edward Beck?” asked Valancy indifferently.Cousin Georgiana stared.“Surely you remember Edward Beck,” she said reproachfully. “He lives in\nthat lovely house on the Port Lawrence road and he comes to our\nchurch—regularly. You _must_ remember him.”“Oh, I think I do now,” said Valancy, with an effort of memory. “He’s\nthat old man with a wen on his forehead and dozens of children, who\nalways sits in the pew by the door, isn’t he?”“Not dozens of children, dear—oh, no, not dozens. Not even _one_ dozen.\nOnly nine. At least only nine that count. The rest are dead. He isn’t\nold—he’s only about forty-eight—the prime of life, Doss—and what does\nit matter about a wen?”"

Could it\nbe possible that Cousin Georgiana was thinking of marrying again?\nMarrying Edward Beck? Absurd. Cousin Georgiana was sixty-five if she\nwere a day and her little anxious face was as closely covered with fine\nwrinkles as if she had been a hundred.

And most of them are boys. So much easier to bring\nup than girls. There’s an excellent book—‘Health Care of the Growing\nChild’—Gladys has a copy, I think. It would be such a help to you. And\nthere are books about morals. You’d manage nicely. Of course I told Mr.\nBeck that I thought you would—would——”“Jump at him,” supplied Valancy.“Oh, no, no, dear.

And you will,\nwon’t you, dearie?”“There’s only one obstacle,” said Valancy dreamily. “You see, I’m\nmarried already.”“Married!” Cousin Georgiana stopped stock-still and stared at Valancy.\n“Married!”“Yes. I was married to Barney Snaith last Tuesday evening in Port\nLawrence.”There was a convenient gate-post hard by. Cousin Georgiana took firm\nhold of it.“Doss, dear—I’m an old woman—are you trying to make fun of me?”“Not at all. I’m only telling you the truth. For heaven’s sake, Cousin\nGeorgiana,”—Valancy was alarmed by certain symptoms—“don’t go crying\nhere on the public road!”Cousin Georgiana choked back the tears and gave a little moan of\ndespair instead.“Oh, Doss, _what_ have you done?
