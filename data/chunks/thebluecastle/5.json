  "content": "“Valancy,” said Mrs. Frederick solemnly, “do you ever pray to be\nforgiven for disobeying your mother?”“I _should_ pray to be forgiven for obeying you so long,” said Valancy\nstubbornly. “But I don’t pray about that at all. I just thank God every\nday for my happiness.”“I would rather,” said Mrs. Frederick, beginning to cry rather\nbelatedly, “see you dead before me than listen to what you have told me\ntoday.”Valancy looked at her mother and aunts, and wondered if they could ever\nhave known anything of the real meaning of love. She felt sorrier for\nthem than ever. They were so very pitiable. And they never suspected\nit.“Barney Snaith is a scoundrel to have deluded you into marrying him,”\nsaid Uncle James violently.“Oh, _I_ did the deluding. I asked _him_ to marry me,” said Valancy,\nwith a wicked smile.“Have you _no_ pride?” demanded Aunt Wellington.“Lots of it. I am proud that I have achieved a husband by my own\nunaided efforts. Cousin Georgiana here wanted to help me to Edward\nBeck.”“Edward Beck is worth twenty thousand dollars and has the finest house\nbetween here and Port Lawrence,” said Uncle Benjamin.“That sounds very fine,” said Valancy scornfully, “but it isn’t worth\n_that_“—she snapped her fingers—“compared to feeling Barney’s arms\naround me and his cheek against mine.”“_Oh_, Doss!” said Cousin Stickles. Cousin Sarah said, “Oh, _Doss_!”\nAunt Wellington said, “Valancy, you need not be indecent.”“Why, it surely isn’t indecent to like to have your husband put his arm\naround you? I should think it would be indecent if you didn’t.”“Why expect decency from her?” inquired Uncle James sarcastically. “She\nhas cut herself off from decency forevermore. She has made her bed. Let\nher lie on it.”“Thanks,” said Valancy very gratefully. “How you would have enjoyed\nbeing Torquemada! Now, I must really be getting back. Mother, may I\nhave those three woollen cushions I worked last winter?”“Take them—take everything!” said Mrs. Frederick.“Oh, I don’t want everything—or much. I don’t want my Blue Castle\ncluttered. Just the cushions. I’ll call for them some day when we motor\nin.”"

She was sorrier\nthan ever for them all. _They_ had no Blue Castle in the purple\nsolitudes of Mistawis.“The trouble with you people is that you don’t laugh enough,” she said.“Doss, dear,” said Cousin Georgiana mournfully, “some day you will\ndiscover that blood is thicker than water.”“Of course it is. But who wants water to be thick?” parried Valancy.\n“We want water to be thin—sparkling—crystal-clear.”Cousin Stickles groaned.Valancy would not ask any of them to come and see her—she was afraid\nthey _would_ come out of curiosity. But she said:“Do you mind if I drop in and see you once in a while, Mother?”“My house will always be open to you,” said Mrs. Frederick, with a\nmournful dignity.“You should never recognise her again,” said Uncle James sternly, as\nthe door closed behind Valancy.“I cannot quite forget that I am a mother,” said Mrs. Frederick. “My\npoor, unfortunate girl!”“I dare say the marriage isn’t legal,” said Uncle James comfortingly.\n“He has probably been married half a dozen times before. But _I_ am\nthrough with her. I have done all I could, Amelia. I think you will\nadmit that. Henceforth”—Uncle James was terribly solemn about\nit—“Valancy is to me as one dead.”“Mrs. Barney Snaith,” said Cousin Georgiana, as if trying it out to see\nhow it would sound.“He has a score of aliases, no doubt,” said Uncle Benjamin. “For my\npart, I believe the man is half Indian. I haven’t a doubt they’re\nliving in a wigwam.”“If he has married her under the name of Snaith and it isn’t his real\nname wouldn’t that make the marriage null and void?” asked Cousin\nStickles hopefully.Uncle James shook his head.“No, it is the man who marries, not the name.”“You know,” said Cousin Gladys, who had recovered and returned but was\nstill shaky, “I had a distinct premonition of this at Herbert’s silver\ndinner. I remarked it at the time. When she was defending Snaith. You\nremember, of course. It came over me like a revelation. I spoke to\nDavid when I went home about it.”“What—_what_,” demanded Aunt Wellington of the universe, “has come over\nValancy? _Valancy_!”"

I don’t hold with many of those new-fangled notions, but\nthere may be something in this one. It would account for her\nincomprehensible conduct.”“Valancy is so fond of mushrooms,” sighed Cousin Georgiana. “I’m afraid\nshe’ll get poisoned eating toadstools by mistake living up back in the\nwoods.”“There are worse things than death,” said Uncle James, believing that\nit was the first time in the world that such a statement had been made.“Nothing can ever be the same again!” sobbed Cousin Stickles.Valancy, hurrying along the dusty road, back to cool Mistawis and her\npurple island, had forgotten all about them—just as she had forgotten\nthat she might drop dead at any moment if she hurried.CHAPTER XXVIIISummer passed by. The Stirling clan—with the insignificant exception of\nCousin Georgiana—had tacitly agreed to follow Uncle James’ example and\nlook upon Valancy as one dead. To be sure, Valancy had an unquiet,\nghostly habit of recurring resurrections when she and Barney clattered\nthrough Deerwood and out to the Port in that unspeakable car. Valancy,\nbareheaded, with stars in her eyes. Barney, bareheaded, smoking his\npipe. But shaved. Always shaved now, if any of them had noticed it.\nThey even had the audacity to go in to Uncle Benjamin’s store to buy\ngroceries. Twice Uncle Benjamin ignored them. Was not Valancy one of\nthe dead? While Snaith had never existed. But the third time he told\nBarney he was a scoundrel who should be hung for luring an unfortunate,\nweak-minded girl away from her home and friends.Barney’s one straight eyebrow went up.“I have made her happy,” he said coolly, “and she was miserable with\nher friends. So that’s that.”Uncle Benjamin stared. It had never occurred to him that women had to\nbe, or ought to be, “made happy.”“You—you pup!” he said."

  "content": "“Why be so unoriginal?” queried Barney amiably. “Anybody could call me\na pup. Why not think of something worthy of the Stirlings? Besides, I’m\nnot a pup. I’m really quite a middle-aged dog. Thirty-five, if you’re\ninterested in knowing.”Uncle Benjamin remembered just in time that Valancy was dead. He turned\nhis back on Barney.Valancy _was_ happy—gloriously and entirely so. She seemed to be living\nin a wonderful house of life and every day opened a new, mysterious\nroom. It was in a world which had nothing in common with the one she\nhad left behind—a world where time was not—which was young with\nimmortal youth—where there was neither past nor future but only the\npresent. She surrendered herself utterly to the charm of it.The absolute freedom of it all was unbelievable. They could do exactly\nas they liked. No Mrs. Grundy. No traditions. No relatives. Or in-laws.\n“Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away,” as Barney quoted\nshamelessly.Valancy had gone home once and got her cushions. And Cousin Georgiana\nhad given her one of her famous candlewick spreads of most elaborate\ndesign. “For your spare-room bed, dear,” she said.“But I haven’t got any spare-room,” said Valancy.Cousin Georgiana looked horrified. A house without a spare-room was\nmonstrous to her.“But it’s a lovely spread,” said Valancy, with a kiss, “and I’m so glad\nto have it. I’ll put it on my own bed. Barney’s old patch-work quilt is\ngetting ragged.”“I don’t see how you can be contented to live up back,” sighed Cousin\nGeorgiana. “It’s so out of the world.”“Contented!” Valancy laughed. What was the use of trying to explain to\nCousin Georgiana. “It is,” she agreed, “most gloriously and entirely\nout of the world.”“And you are really happy, dear?” asked Cousin Georgiana wistfully.“I really am,” said Valancy gravely, her eyes dancing.“Marriage is such a serious thing,” sighed Cousin Georgiana.“When it’s going to last long,” agreed Valancy.Cousin Georgiana did not understand this at all. But it worried her and\nshe lay awake at nights wondering what Valancy meant by it."

  "content": "Valancy loved her Blue Castle and was completely satisfied with it. The\nbig living-room had three windows, all commanding exquisite views of\nexquisite Mistawis. The one in the end of the room was an oriel\nwindow—which Tom MacMurray, Barney explained, had got out of some\nlittle, old “up back” church that had been sold. It faced the west and\nwhen the sunsets flooded it Valancy’s whole being knelt in prayer as if\nin some great cathedral. The new moons always looked down through it,\nthe lower pine boughs swayed about the top of it, and all through the\nnights the soft, dim silver of the lake dreamed through it.There was a stone fireplace on the other side. No desecrating gas\nimitation but a real fireplace where you could burn real logs. With a\nbig grizzly bearskin on the floor before it, and beside it a hideous,\nred-plush sofa of Tom MacMurray’s régime. But its ugliness was hidden\nby silver-grey timber wolf skins, and Valancy’s cushions made it gay\nand comfortable. In a corner a nice, tall, lazy old clock ticked—the\nright kind of a clock. One that did not hurry the hours away but ticked\nthem off deliberately. It was the jolliest looking old clock. A fat,\ncorpulent clock with a great, round, man’s face painted on it, the\nhands stretching out of its nose and the hours encircling it like a\nhalo.There was a big glass case of stuffed owls and several deer\nheads—likewise of Tom MacMurray’s vintage. Some comfortable old chairs\nthat asked to be sat upon. A squat little chair with a cushion was\nprescriptively Banjo’s. If anybody else dared sit on it Banjo glared\nhim out of it with his topaz-hued, black-ringed eyes. Banjo had an\nadorable habit of hanging over the back of it, trying to catch his own\ntail. Losing his temper because he couldn’t catch it. Giving it a\nfierce bite for spite when he _did_ catch it. Yowling malignantly with\npain. Barney and Valancy laughed at him until they ached. But it was\nGood Luck they loved. They were both agreed that Good Luck was so\nlovable that he practically amounted to an obsession.One side of the wall was lined with rough, homemade book-shelves filled\nwith books, and between the two side windows hung an old mirror in a\nfaded gilt frame, with fat cupids gamboling in the panel over the\nglass. A mirror, Valancy thought, that must be like the fabled mirror\ninto which Venus had once looked and which thereafter reflected as\nbeautiful every woman who looked into it. Valancy thought she was\nalmost pretty in that mirror. But that may have been because she had\nshingled her hair."

  "content": "This was before the day of bobs and was regarded as a wild, unheard-of\nproceeding—unless you had typhoid. When Mrs. Frederick heard of it she\nalmost decided to erase Valancy’s name from the family Bible. Barney\ncut the hair, square off at the back of Valancy’s neck, bringing it\ndown in a short black fringe over her forehead. It gave a meaning and a\npurpose to her little, three-cornered face that it never had possessed\nbefore. Even her nose ceased to irritate her. Her eyes were bright, and\nher sallow skin had cleared to the hue of creamy ivory. The old family\njoke had come true—she was really fat at last—anyway, no longer skinny.\nValancy might never be beautiful, but she was of the type that looks\nits best in the woods—elfin—mocking—alluring.Her heart bothered her very little. When an attack threatened she was\ngenerally able to head it off with Dr. Trent’s prescription. The only\nbad one she had was one night when she was temporarily out of medicine.\nAnd it _was_ a bad one. For the time being, Valancy realised keenly\nthat death was actually waiting to pounce on her any moment. But the\nrest of the time she would not—did not—let herself remember it at all.CHAPTER XXIXValancy toiled not, neither did she spin. There was really very little\nwork to do. She cooked their meals on a coal-oil stove, performing all\nher little domestic rites carefully and exultingly, and they ate out on\nthe verandah that almost overhung the lake. Before them lay Mistawis,\nlike a scene out of some fairy tale of old time. And Barney smiling his\ntwisted, enigmatical smile at her across the table.“What a view old Tom picked out when he built this shack!” Barney would\nsay exultantly.Supper was the meal Valancy liked best. The faint laughter of winds was\nalways about them and the colours of Mistawis, imperial and spiritual,\nunder the changing clouds were something that cannot be expressed in\nmere words. Shadows, too. Clustering in the pines until a wind shook\nthem out and pursued them over Mistawis. They lay all day along the\nshores, threaded by ferns and wild blossoms. They stole around the\nheadlands in the glow of the sunset, until twilight wove them all into\none great web of dusk.The cats, with their wise, innocent little faces, would sit on the\nverandah railing and eat the tidbits Barney flung them. And how good\neverything tasted! Valancy, amid all the romance of Mistawis, never\nforgot that men had stomachs. Barney paid her no end of compliments on\nher cooking.“After all,” he admitted, “there’s something to be said for square\nmeals. I’ve mostly got along by boiling two or three dozen eggs hard at\nonce and eating a few when I got hungry, with a slice of bacon once in\na while and a jorum of tea.”"

  "content": "Valancy poured tea out of Barney’s little battered old pewter teapot of\nincredible age. She had not even a set of dishes—only Barney’s\nmismatched chipped bits—and a dear, big, pobby old jug of robin’s-egg\nblue.After the meal was over they would sit there and talk for hours—or sit\nand say nothing, in all the languages of the world, Barney pulling away\nat his pipe, Valancy dreaming idly and deliciously, gazing at the\nfar-off hills beyond Mistawis where the spires of firs came out against\nthe sunset. The moonlight would begin to silver the Mistawis dusk. Bats\nwould begin to swoop darkly against the pale, western gold. The little\nwaterfall that came down on the high bank not far away would, by some\nwhim of the wildwood gods, begin to look like a wonderful white woman\nbeckoning through the spicy, fragrant evergreens. And Leander would\nbegin to chuckle diabolically on the mainland shore. How sweet it was\nto sit there and do nothing in the beautiful silence, with Barney at\nthe other side of the table, smoking!There were plenty of other islands in sight, though none were near\nenough to be troublesome as neighbours. There was one little group of\nislets far off to the west which they called the Fortunate Isles. At\nsunrise they looked like a cluster of emeralds, at sunset like a\ncluster of amethysts. They were too small for houses; but the lights on\nthe larger islands would bloom out all over the lake, and bonfires\nwould be lighted on their shores, streaming up into the wood shadows\nand throwing great, blood-red ribbons over the waters. Music would\ndrift to them alluringly from boats here and there, or from the\nverandahs on the big house of the millionaire on the biggest island.“Would you like a house like that, Moonlight?” Barney asked once,\nwaving his hand at it. He had taken to calling her Moonlight, and\nValancy loved it."

  "content": "“No,” said Valancy, who had once dreamed of a mountain castle ten times\nthe size of the rich man’s “cottage” and now pitied the poor\ninhabitants of palaces. “No. It’s too elegant. I would have to carry it\nwith me everywhere I went. On my back like a snail. It would own\nme—possess me, body and soul. I like a house I can love and cuddle and\nboss. Just like ours here. I don’t envy Hamilton Gossard ‘the finest\nsummer residence in Canada.’ It is magnificent, but it isn’t my Blue\nCastle.”Away down at the far end of the lake they got every night a glimpse of\na big, continental train rushing through a clearing. Valancy liked to\nwatch its lighted windows flash by and wonder who was on it and what\nhopes and fears it carried. She also amused herself by picturing Barney\nand herself going to the dances and dinners in the houses on the\nislands, but she did not want to go in reality. Once they did go to a\nmasquerade dance in the pavilion at one of the hotels up the lake, and\nhad a glorious evening, but slipped away in their canoe, before\nunmasking time, back to the Blue Castle.“It was lovely—but I don’t want to go again,” said Valancy.So many hours a day Barney shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber.\nValancy never saw the inside of it. From the smells that filtered\nthrough at times she concluded he must be conducting chemical\nexperiments—or counterfeiting money. Valancy supposed there must be\nsmelly processes in making counterfeit money. But she did not trouble\nherself about it. She had no desire to peer into the locked chambers of\nBarney’s house of life. His past and his future concerned her not. Only\nthis rapturous present. Nothing else mattered.Once he went away and stayed away two days and nights. He had asked\nValancy if she would be afraid to stay alone and she had said she would\nnot. He never told her where he had been. She was not afraid to be\nalone, but she was horribly lonely. The sweetest sound she had ever\nheard was Lady Jane’s clatter through the woods when Barney returned.\nAnd then his signal whistle from the shore. She ran down to the landing\nrock to greet him—to nestle herself into his eager arms—they _did_ seem\neager.“Have you missed me, Moonlight?” Barney was whispering.“It seems a hundred years since you went away,” said Valancy.“I won’t leave you again.”“You must,” protested Valancy, “if you want to. I’d be miserable if I\nthought you wanted to go and didn’t, because of me. I want you to feel\nperfectly free.”"

And comparative bondages. _You_ think you are free\nnow because you’ve escaped from a peculiarly unbearable kind of\nbondage. But are you? You love me—_that’s_ a bondage.”“Who said or wrote that ‘the prison unto which we doom ourselves no\nprison is’?” asked Valancy dreamily, clinging to his arm as they\nclimbed up the rock steps.“Ah, now you have it,” said Barney. “That’s all the freedom we can hope\nfor—the freedom to choose our prison. But, Moonlight,”—he stopped at\nthe door of the Blue Castle and looked about him—at the glorious lake,\nthe great, shadowy woods, the bonfires, the twinkling\nlights—“Moonlight, I’m glad to be home again. When I came down through\nthe woods and saw my home lights—mine—gleaming out under the old\npines—something I’d never seen before—oh, girl, I was glad—glad!”But in spite of Barney’s doctrine of bondage, Valancy thought they were\nsplendidly free. It was amazing to be able to sit up half the night and\nlook at the moon if you wanted to. To be late for meals if you wanted\nto—she who had always been rebuked so sharply by her mother and so\nreproachfully by Cousin Stickles if she were one minute late. Dawdle\nover meals as long as you wanted to. Leave your crusts if you wanted\nto. Not come home at all for meals if you wanted to. Sit on a sun-warm\nrock and paddle your bare feet in the hot sand if you wanted to. Just\nsit and do nothing in the beautiful silence if you wanted to. In short,\ndo any fool thing you wanted to whenever the notion took you. If _that_\nwasn’t freedom, what was?CHAPTER XXX"

They spent more than\nhalf of them wandering at will through the enchanted Muskoka country.\nBarney knew the woods as a book and he taught their lore and craft to\nValancy. He could always find trail and haunt of the shy wood people.\nValancy learned the different fairy-likenesses of the mosses—the charm\nand exquisiteness of woodland blossoms. She learned to know every bird\nat sight and mimic its call—though never so perfectly as Barney. She\nmade friends with every kind of tree. She learned to paddle a canoe as\nwell as Barney himself. She liked to be out in the rain and she never\ncaught cold.Sometimes they took a lunch with them and went berrying—strawberries\nand blueberries. How pretty blueberries were—the dainty green of the\nunripe berries, the glossy pinks and scarlets of the half ripes, the\nmisty blue of the fully matured! And Valancy learned the real flavour\nof the strawberry in its highest perfection. There was a certain sunlit\ndell on the banks of Mistawis along which white birches grew on one\nside and on the other still, changeless ranks of young spruces. There\nwere long grasses at the roots of the birches, combed down by the winds\nand wet with morning dew late into the afternoons. Here they found\nberries that might have graced the banquets of Lucullus, great\nambrosial sweetnesses hanging like rubies to long, rosy stalks. They\nlifted them by the stalk and ate them from it, uncrushed and virgin,\ntasting each berry by itself with all its wild fragrance ensphered\ntherein. When Valancy carried any of these berries home that elusive\nessence escaped and they became nothing more than the common berries of\nthe market-place—very kitchenly good indeed, but not as they would have\nbeen, eaten in their birch dell until her fingers were stained as pink\nas Aurora’s eyelids.Or they went after water-lilies. Barney knew where to find them in the\ncreeks and bays of Mistawis. Then the Blue Castle was glorious with\nthem, every receptacle that Valancy could contrive filled with the\nexquisite things. If not water lilies then cardinal flowers, fresh and\nvivid from the swamps of Mistawis, where they burned like ribbons of\nflame."

Then\nall they took with them were some raw potatoes and salt. They roasted\nthe potatoes over a fire and Barney showed Valancy how to cook the\ntrout by wrapping them in leaves, coating them with mud and baking them\nin a bed of hot coals. Never were such delicious meals. Valancy had\nsuch an appetite it was no wonder she put flesh on her bones.Or they just prowled and explored through woods that always seemed to\nbe expecting something wonderful to happen. At least, that was the way\nValancy felt about them. Down the next hollow—over the next hill—you\nwould find it.“We don’t know where we’re going, but isn’t it fun to go?” Barney used\nto say.Once or twice night overtook them, too far from their Blue Castle to\nget back. But Barney made a fragrant bed of bracken and fir boughs and\nthey slept on it dreamlessly, under a ceiling of old spruces with moss\nhanging from them, while beyond them moonlight and the murmur of pines\nblended together so that one could hardly tell which was light and\nwhich was sound.There were rainy days, of course, when Muskoka was a wet green land.\nDays when showers drifted across Mistawis like pale ghosts of rain and\nthey never thought of staying in because of it. Days when it rained in\nright good earnest and they had to stay in. Then Barney shut himself up\nin Bluebeard’s Chamber and Valancy read, or dreamed on the wolfskins\nwith Good Luck purring beside her and Banjo watching them suspiciously\nfrom his own peculiar chair. On Sunday evenings they paddled across to\na point of land and walked from there through the woods to the little\nFree Methodist church. One felt really too happy for Sunday.

How—how Barney-like! That summed it all up.Valancy had taken some of her two hundred dollars out of the bank and\nspent it in pretty clothes.

She found\nit hard to believe that she had ever been lonely and unhappy and\nafraid.“When death comes, I shall have lived,” thought Valancy. “I shall have\nhad my hour.”And her dust-pile!One day Valancy had heaped up the sand in the little island cove in a\ntremendous cone and stuck a gay little Union Jack on top of it.“What are you celebrating?” Barney wanted to know.“I’m just exorcising an old demon,” Valancy told him.CHAPTER XXXI"

Long dreamy purple days paddling idly in\ntheir canoe along shores and up the rivers of crimson and gold. A\nsleepy, red hunter’s moon. Enchanted tempests that stripped the leaves\nfrom the trees and heaped them along the shores. Flying shadows of\nclouds. What had all the smug, opulent lands out front to compare with\nthis?November—with uncanny witchery in its changed trees. With murky red\nsunsets flaming in smoky crimson behind the westering hills. With dear\ndays when the austere woods were beautiful and gracious in a dignified\nserenity of folded hands and closed eyes—days full of a fine, pale\nsunshine that sifted through the late, leafless gold of the\njuniper-trees and glimmered among the grey beeches, lighting up\nevergreen banks of moss and washing the colonnades of the pines. Days\nwith a high-sprung sky of flawless turquoise. Days when an exquisite\nmelancholy seemed to hang over the landscape and dream about the lake.\nBut days, too, of the wild blackness of great autumn storms, followed\nby dank, wet, streaming nights when there was witch-laughter in the\npines and fitful moans among the mainland trees.

Lovely ferns of\nice all over the windows of the Blue Castle. Moonlight on birches in a\nsilver thaw. Ragged shadows on windy evenings—torn, twisted, fantastic\nshadows. Great silences, austere and searching. Jewelled, barbaric\nhills. The sun suddenly breaking through grey clouds over long, white\nMistawis. Icy-grey twilights, broken by snow-squalls, when their cosy\nliving-room, with its goblins of firelight and inscrutable cats seemed\ncosier than ever. Every hour brought a new revelation and wonder.Barney ran Lady Jane into Roaring Abel’s barn and taught Valancy how to\nsnowshoe—Valancy, who ought to be laid up with bronchitis. But Valancy\nhad not even a cold. Later on in the winter Barney had a terrible one\nand Valancy nursed him through it with a dread of pneumonia in her\nheart. But Valancy’s colds seemed to have gone where old moons go.\nWhich was luck—for she hadn’t even Redfern’s Liniment. She had\nthoughtfully bought a bottle at the Port and Barney had hurled it into\nfrozen Mistawis with a scowl.“Bring no more of that devilish stuff here,” he had ordered briefly. It\nwas the first and last time he had spoken harshly to her.They went for long tramps through the exquisite reticence of winter\nwoods and the silver jungles of frosted trees, and found loveliness\neverywhere.At times they seemed to be walking through a spellbound world of\ncrystal and pearl, so white and radiant were clearings and lakes and\nsky. The air was so crisp and clear that it was half intoxicating."

  "content": "Once they stood in a hesitation of ecstasy at the entrance of a narrow\npath between ranks of birches. Every twig and spray was outlined in\nsnow. The undergrowth along its sides was a little fairy forest cut out\nof marble. The shadows cast by the pale sunshine were fine and\nspiritual.“Come away,” said Barney, turning. “We must not commit the desecration\nof tramping through there.”One evening they came upon a snowdrift far back in an old clearing\nwhich was in the exact likeness of a beautiful woman’s profile. Seen\ntoo close by, the resemblance was lost, as in the fairy-tale of the\nCastle of St. John. Seen from behind, it was a shapeless oddity. But at\njust the right distance and angle the outline was so perfect that when\nthey came suddenly upon it, gleaming out against the dark background of\nspruce in the glow of that winter sunset they both exclaimed in\namazement. There was a low, noble brow, a straight, classic nose, lips\nand chin and cheek-curve modelled as if some goddess of old time had\nsat to the sculptor, and a breast of such cold, swelling purity as the\nvery spirit of the winter woods might display.“‘All the beauty that old Greece and Rome, sung painted, taught,’”\nquoted Barney.“And to think no human eyes save ours have seen or will see it,”\nbreathed Valancy, who felt at times as if she were living in a book by\nJohn Foster. As she looked around her she recalled some passages she\nhad marked in the new Foster book Barney had brought her from the\nPort—with an adjuration not to expect _him_ to read or listen to it."

  "content": "“‘All the tintings of winter woods are extremely delicate and\nelusive,’” recalled Valancy. “‘When the brief afternoon wanes and the\nsun just touches the tops of the hills, there seems to be all over the\nwoods an abundance, not of colour, but of the spirit of colour. There\nis really nothing but pure white after all, but one has the impression\nof fairy-like blendings of rose and violet, opal and heliotrope on the\nslopes—in the dingles and along the curves of the forest-land. You feel\nsure the tint is there, but when you look at it directly it is gone.\nFrom the corner of your eye you are aware that it is lurking over\nyonder in a spot where there was nothing but pale purity a moment ago.\nOnly just when the sun is setting is there a fleeting moment of real\ncolour. Then the redness streams out over the snow and incarnadines the\nhills and rivers and smites the crest of the pines with flame. Just a\nfew minutes of transfiguration and revelation—and it is gone.’“I wonder if John Foster ever spent a winter in Mistawis,” said\nValancy.“Not likely,” scoffed Barney. “People who write tosh like that\ngenerally write it in a warm house on some smug city street.”“You are too hard on John Foster,” said Valancy severely. “No one could\nhave written that little paragraph I read you last night without having\nseen it first—you know he couldn’t.”“I didn’t listen to it,” said Barney morosely. “You know I told you I\nwouldn’t.”“Then you’ve got to listen to it now,” persisted Valancy. She made him\nstand still on his snowshoes while she repeated it.“‘She is a rare artist, this old Mother Nature, who works “for the joy\nof working” and not in any spirit of vain show. Today the fir woods are\na symphony of greens and greys, so subtle that you cannot tell where\none shade begins to be the other. Grey trunk, green bough, grey-green\nmoss above the white, grey-shadowed floor. Yet the old gypsy doesn’t\nlike unrelieved monotones. She must have a dash of colour. See it. A\nbroken dead fir bough, of a beautiful red-brown, swinging among the\nbeards of moss.’”“Good Lord, do you learn all that fellow’s books by heart?” was\nBarney’s disgusted reaction as he strode off.“John Foster’s books were all that saved my soul alive the past five\nyears,” averred Valancy. “Oh, Barney, look at that exquisite filigree\nof snow in the furrows of that old elm-tree trunk.”"

  "content": "When they came out to the lake they changed from snowshoes to skates\nand skated home. For a wonder Valancy had learned, when she was a\nlittle schoolgirl, to skate on the pond behind the Deerwood school. She\nnever had any skates of her own, but some of the other girls had lent\nher theirs and she seemed to have a natural knack of it. Uncle Benjamin\nhad once promised her a pair of skates for Christmas, but when\nChristmas came he had given her rubbers instead. She had never skated\nsince she grew up, but the old trick came back quickly, and glorious\nwere the hours she and Barney spent skimming over the white lakes and\npast the dark islands where the summer cottages were closed and silent.\nTonight they flew down Mistawis before the wind, in an exhilaration\nthat crimsoned Valancy’s cheeks under her white tam. And at the end was\nher dear little house, on the island of pines, with a coating of snow\non its roof, sparkling in the moonlight. Its windows glinted impishly\nat her in the stay gleams.“Looks exactly like a picture-book, doesn’t it?” said Barney.They had a lovely Christmas. No rush. No scramble. No niggling attempts\nto make ends meet. No wild effort to remember whether she hadn’t given\nthe same kind of present to the same person two Christmases before—no\nmob of last-minute shoppers—no dreary family “reunions” where she sat\nmute and unimportant—no attacks of “nerves.” They decorated the Blue\nCastle with pine boughs, and Valancy made delightful little tinsel\nstars and hung them up amid the greenery. She cooked a dinner to which\nBarney did full justice, while Good Luck and Banjo picked the bones.“A land that can produce a goose like that is an admirable land,” vowed\nBarney. “Canada forever!” And they drank to the Union Jack a bottle of\ndandelion wine that Cousin Georgiana had given Valancy along with the\nbedspread.“One never knows,” Cousin Georgiana had said solemnly, “when one may\nneed a little stimulant.”Barney had asked Valancy what she wanted for a Christmas present.“Something frivolous and unnecessary,” said Valancy, who had got a pair\nof goloshes last Christmas and two long-sleeved, woolen undervests the\nyear before. And so on back.To her delight, Barney gave her a necklace of pearl beads. Valancy had\nwanted a string of milky pearl beads—like congealed moonshine—all her\nlife. And these were so pretty. All that worried her was that they were\nreally too good. They must have cost a great deal—fifteen dollars, at\nleast. Could Barney afford that? She didn’t know a thing about his\nfinances. She had refused to let him buy any of her clothes—she had\nenough for that, she told him, as long as she would need clothes. In a\nround, black jar on the chimney-piece Barney put money for their\nhousehold expenses—always enough. The jar was never empty, though\nValancy never caught him replenishing it. He couldn’t have much, of\ncourse, and that necklace—but Valancy tossed care aside. She would wear\nit and enjoy it. It was the first pretty thing she had ever had."

The thermometer went miles below zero and stayed there.\nBut, as Barney and Valancy pointed out to each other, there were no\nmosquitoes. And the roar and crackle of their big fire drowned the\nhowls of the north wind. Good Luck and Banjo waxed fat and developed\nresplendent coats of thick, silky fur. Nip and Tuck had gone.“But they’ll come back in spring,” promised Barney.There was no monotony. Sometimes they had dramatic little private spats\nthat never even thought of becoming quarrels. Sometimes Roaring Abel\ndropped in—for an evening or a whole day—with his old tartan cap and\nhis long red beard coated with snow. He generally brought his fiddle\nand played for them, to the delight of all except Banjo, who would go\ntemporarily insane and retreat under Valancy’s bed. Sometimes Abel and\nBarney talked while Valancy made candy for them; sometimes they sat and\nsmoked in silence _à la_ Tennyson and Carlyle, until the Blue Castle\nreeked and Valancy fled to the open. Sometimes they played checkers\nfiercely and silently the whole night through. Sometimes they all ate\nthe russet apples Abel had brought, while the jolly old clock ticked\nthe delightful minutes away.“A plate of apples, an open fire, and ‘a jolly goode booke whereon to\nlooke’ are a fair substitute for heaven,” vowed Barney. “Any one can\nhave the streets of gold. Let’s have another whack at Carman.”"

  "content": "It was easier now for the Stirlings to believe Valancy of the dead. Not\neven dim rumours of her having been over at the Port came to trouble\nthem, though she and Barney used to skate there occasionally to see a\nmovie and eat hot dogs shamelessly at the corner stand afterwards.\nPresumably none of the Stirlings ever thought about her—except Cousin\nGeorgiana, who used to lie awake worrying about poor Doss. Did she have\nenough to eat? Was that dreadful creature good to her? Was she warm\nenough at nights?Valancy was quite warm at nights. She used to wake up and revel\nsilently in the cosiness of those winter nights on that little island\nin the frozen lake. The nights of other winters had been so cold and\nlong. Valancy hated to wake up in them and think about the bleakness\nand emptiness of the day that had passed and the bleakness and\nemptiness of the day that would come. Now, she almost counted that\nnight lost on which she didn’t wake up and lie awake for half an hour\njust being happy, while Barney’s regular breathing went on beside her,\nand through the open door the smouldering brands in the fireplace\nwinked at her in the gloom. It was very nice to feel a little Lucky cat\njump up on your bed in the darkness and snuggle down at your feet,\npurring; but Banjo would be sitting dourly by himself out in front of\nthe fire like a brooding demon. At such moments Banjo was anything but\ncanny, but Valancy loved his uncanniness."

  "content": "The side of the bed had to be right against the window. There was no\nother place for it in the tiny room. Valancy, lying there, could look\nout of the window, through the big pine boughs that actually touched\nit, away up Mistawis, white and lustrous as a pavement of pearl, or\ndark and terrible in the storm. Sometimes the pine boughs tapped\nagainst the panes with friendly signals. Sometimes she heard the little\nhissing whisper of snow against them right at her side. Some nights the\nwhole outer world seemed given over to the empery of silence; then came\nnights when there would be a majestic sweep of wind in the pines;\nnights of dear starlight when it whistled freakishly and joyously\naround the Blue Castle; brooding nights before storm when it crept\nalong the floor of the lake with a low, wailing cry of boding and\nmystery. Valancy wasted many perfectly good sleeping hours in these\ndelightful communings. But she could sleep as long in the morning as\nshe wanted to. Nobody cared. Barney cooked his own breakfast of bacon\nand eggs and then shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber till supper\ntime. Then they had an evening of reading and talk. They talked about\neverything in this world and a good many things in other worlds. They\nlaughed over their own jokes until the Blue Castles re-echoed.“You _do_ laugh beautifully,” Barney told her once. “It makes me want\nto laugh just to hear you laugh. There’s a trick about your laugh—as if\nthere were so much more fun back of it that you wouldn’t let out. Did\nyou laugh like that before you came to Mistawis, Moonlight?”“I never laughed at all—really. I used to giggle foolishly when I felt\nI was expected to. But now—the laugh just comes.”It struck Valancy more than once that Barney himself laughed a great\ndeal oftener than he used to and that his laugh had changed. It had\nbecome wholesome. She rarely heard the little cynical note in it now.\nCould a man laugh like that who had crimes on his conscience? Yet\nBarney _must_ have done something. Valancy had indifferently made up\nher mind as to what he had done. She concluded he was a defaulting bank\ncashier. She had found in one of Barney’s books an old clipping cut\nfrom a Montreal paper in which a vanished, defaulting cashier was\ndescribed. The description applied to Barney—as well as to half a dozen\nother men Valancy knew—and from some casual remarks he had dropped from\ntime to time she concluded he knew Montreal rather well. Valancy had it\nall figured out in the back of her mind. Barney had been in a bank. He\nwas tempted to take some money to speculate—meaning, of course, to put\nit back. He had got in deeper and deeper, until he found there was\nnothing for it but flight. It had happened so to scores of men. He had,\nValancy was absolutely certain, never meant to do wrong. Of course, the\nname of the man in the clipping was Bernard Craig. But Valancy had\nalways thought Snaith was an alias. Not that it mattered."

  "content": "Valancy had only one unhappy night that winter. It came in late March\nwhen most of the snow had gone and Nip and Tuck had returned. Barney\nhad gone off in the afternoon for a long, woodland tramp, saying he\nwould be back by dark if all went well. Soon after he had gone it had\nbegun to snow. The wind rose and presently Mistawis was in the grip of\none of the worst storms of the winter. It tore up the lake and struck\nat the little house. The dark angry woods on the mainland scowled at\nValancy, menace in the toss of their boughs, threats in their windy\ngloom, terror in the roar of their hearts. The trees on the island\ncrouched in fear. Valancy spent the night huddled on the rug before the\nfire, her face buried in her hands, when she was not vainly peering\nfrom the oriel in a futile effort to see through the furious smoke of\nwind and snow that had once been blue-dimpled Mistawis. Where was\nBarney? Lost on the merciless lakes? Sinking exhausted in the drifts of\nthe pathless woods? Valancy died a hundred deaths that night and paid\nin full for all the happiness of her Blue Castle. When morning came the\nstorm broke and cleared; the sun shone gloriously over Mistawis; and at\nnoon Barney came home. Valancy saw him from the oriel as he came around\na wooded point, slender and black against the glistening white world.\nShe did not run to meet him. Something happened to her knees and she\ndropped down on Banjo’s chair. Luckily Banjo got out from under in\ntime, his whiskers bristling with indignation. Barney found her there,\nher head buried in her hands.“Barney, I thought you were dead,” she whispered.Barney hooted.“After two years of the Klondike did you think a baby storm like this\ncould get me? I spent the night in that old lumber shanty over by\nMuskoka. A bit cold but snug enough. Little goose! Your eyes look like\nburnt holes in a blanket. Did you sit up here all night worrying over\nan old woodsman like me?”“Yes,” said Valancy. “I—couldn’t help it. The storm seemed so wild.\nAnybody might have been lost in it. When—I saw you—come round the\npoint—there—something happened to me. I don’t know what. It was as if I\nhad died and come back to life. I can’t describe it any other way.”CHAPTER XXXIIISpring. Mistawis black and sullen for a week or two, then flaming in\nsapphire and turquoise, lilac and rose again, laughing through the\noriel, caressing its amethyst islands, rippling under winds soft as\nsilk. Frogs, little green wizards of swamp and pool, singing everywhere\nin the long twilights and long into the nights; islands fairy-like in a\ngreen haze; the evanescent beauty of wild young trees in early leaf;\nfrost-like loveliness of the new foliage of juniper-trees; the woods\nputting on a fashion of spring flowers, dainty, spiritual things akin\nto the soul of the wilderness; red mist on the maples; willows decked\nout with glossy silver pussies; all the forgotten violets of Mistawis\nblooming again; lure of April moons.“Think how many thousands of springs have been here on Mistawis—and all\nof them beautiful,” said Valancy. “Oh, Barney, look at that wild plum!\nI will—I must quote from John Foster. There’s a passage in one of his\nbooks—I’ve re-read it a hundred times. He must have written it before a\ntree just like that:"

The fingers of wood\npixies must have woven it, for nothing like it ever came from an\nearthly loom. I vow the tree is conscious of its loveliness. It is\nbridling before our very eyes—as if its beauty were not the most\nephemeral thing in the woods, as it is the rarest and most exceeding,\nfor today it is and tomorrow it is not. Every south wind purring\nthrough the boughs will winnow away a shower of slender petals. But\nwhat matter? Today it is queen of the wild places and it is always\ntoday in the woods.’”“I’m sure you feel much better since you’ve got that out of your\nsystem,” said Barney heartlessly.“Here’s a patch of dandelions,” said Valancy, unsubdued. “Dandelions\nshouldn’t grow in the woods, though. They haven’t any sense of the\nfitness of things at all. They are too cheerful and self-satisfied.\nThey haven’t any of the mystery and reserve of the real wood-flowers.”“In short, they’ve no secrets,” said Barney. “But wait a bit. The woods\nwill have their own way even with those obvious dandelions. In a little\nwhile all that obtrusive yellowness and complacency will be gone and\nwe’ll find here misty, phantom-like globes hovering over those long\ngrasses in full harmony with the traditions of the forest.”“That sounds John Fosterish,” teased Valancy.“What have I done that deserved a slam like that?” complained Barney.One of the earliest signs of spring was the renaissance of Lady Jane.\nBarney put her on roads that no other car would look at, and they went\nthrough Deerwood in mud to the axles. They passed several Stirlings,\nwho groaned and reflected that now spring was come they would encounter\nthat shameless pair everywhere. Valancy, prowling about Deerwood shops,\nmet Uncle Benjamin on the street; but he did not realise until he had\ngone two blocks further on that the girl in the scarlet-collared\nblanket coat, with cheeks reddened in the sharp April air and the\nfringe of black hair over laughing, slanted eyes, was Valancy. When he\ndid realise it, Uncle Benjamin was indignant. What business had Valancy\nto look like—like—like a young girl? The way of the transgressor was\nhard. Had to be. Scriptural and proper. Yet Valancy’s path couldn’t be\nhard. She wouldn’t look like that if it were. There was something\nwrong. It was almost enough to make a man turn modernist."
