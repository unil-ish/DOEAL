  "content": "Well! Valancy pushed the proofs indifferently aside and sat down in the\nswivel-chair. She took up Barney’s pen—and a vile one it was—pulled a\nsheet of paper to her and began to write. She could not think of\nanything to say except bald facts.“Dear Barney:—I went to Dr. Trent this morning and found out he had sent me the wrong\nletter by mistake. There never was anything serious the matter with my\nheart and I am quite well now.I did not mean to trick you. Please believe that. I could not bear it\nif you did not believe that. I am very sorry for the mistake. But\nsurely you can get a divorce if I leave you. Is desertion a ground for\ndivorce in Canada? Of course if there is anything I can do to help or\nhasten it I will do it gladly, if your lawyer will let me know.I thank you for all your kindness to me. I shall never forget it. Think\nas kindly of me as you can, because I did not mean to trap you.\nGood-bye.Yours gratefully,VALANCY.”It was very cold and stiff, she knew. But to try to say anything else\nwould be dangerous—like tearing away a dam. She didn’t know what\ntorrent of wild incoherences and passionate anguish might pour out. In\na postscript she added:“Your father was here today. He is coming back tomorrow. He told me\neverything. I think you should go back to him. He is very lonely for\nyou.”She put the letter in an envelope, wrote “Barney” across it, and left\nit on the desk. On it she laid the string of pearls. If they had been\nthe beads she believed them she would have kept them in memory of that\nwonderful year. But she could not keep the fifteen thousand dollar gift\nof a man who had married her out of pity and whom she was now leaving.\nIt hurt her to give up her pretty bauble. That was an odd thing, she\nreflected. The fact that she was leaving Barney did not hurt her—yet.\nIt lay at her heart like a cold, insensible thing. If it came to\nlife—Valancy shuddered and went out——"

  "content": "She put on her hat and mechanically fed Good Luck and Banjo. She locked\nthe door and carefully hid the key in the old pine. Then she crossed to\nthe mainland in the disappearing propeller. She stood for a moment on\nthe bank, looking at her Blue Castle. The rain had not yet come, but\nthe sky was dark, and Mistawis grey and sullen. The little house under\nthe pines looked very pathetic—a casket rifled of its jewels—a lamp\nwith its flame blown out.“I shall never again hear the wind crying over Mistawis at night,”\nthought Valancy. This hurt her, too. She could have laughed to think\nthat such a trifle could hurt her at such a time.CHAPTER XLValancy paused a moment on the porch of the brick house in Elm Street.\nShe felt that she ought to knock like a stranger. Her rosebush, she\nidly noticed, was loaded with buds. The rubber-plant stood beside the\nprim door. A momentary horror overcame her—a horror of the existence to\nwhich she was returning. Then she opened the door and walked in.“I wonder if the Prodigal Son ever felt really at home again,” she\nthought.Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles were in the sitting-room. Uncle\nBenjamin was there, too. They looked blankly at Valancy, realising at\nonce that something was wrong. This was not the saucy, impudent thing\nwho had laughed at them in this very room last summer. This was a\ngrey-faced woman with the eyes of a creature who had been stricken by a\nmortal blow.Valancy looked indifferently around the room. She had changed so\nmuch—and it had changed so little. The same pictures hung on the walls.\nThe little orphan who knelt at her never-finished prayer by the bed\nwhereon reposed the black kitten that never grew up into a cat. The\ngrey “steel engraving” of Quatre Bras, where the British regiment\nforever stood at bay. The crayon enlargement of the boyish father she\nhad never known. There they all hung in the same places. The green\ncascade of “Wandering Jew” still tumbled out of the old granite\nsaucepan on the window-stand. The same elaborate, never-used pitcher\nstood at the same angle on the sideboard shelf. The blue and gilt vases\nthat had been among her mother’s wedding-presents still primly adorned\nthe mantelpiece, flanking the china clock of berosed and besprayed ware\nthat never went. The chairs in exactly the same places. Her mother and\nCousin Stickles, likewise unchanged, regarding her with stony\nunwelcome.Valancy had to speak first."

  "content": "“I’ve come home, Mother,” she said tiredly.“So I see.” Mrs. Frederick’s voice was very icy. She had resigned\nherself to Valancy’s desertion. She had almost succeeded in forgetting\nthere was a Valancy. She had rearranged and organised her systematic\nlife without any reference to an ungrateful, rebellious child. She had\ntaken her place again in a society which ignored the fact that she had\never had a daughter and pitied her, if it pitied her at all, only in\ndiscreet whispers and asides. The plain truth was that, by this time,\nMrs. Frederick did not want Valancy to come back—did not want ever to\nsee or hear of her again.And now, of course, Valancy was here. With tragedy and disgrace and\nscandal trailing after her visibly. “So I see,” said Mrs. Frederick.\n“May I ask why?”“Because—I’m—not—going to die,” said Valancy huskily.“God bless my soul!” said Uncle Benjamin. “Who said you were going to\ndie?”“I suppose,” said Cousin Stickles shrewishly—Cousin Stickles did not\nwant Valancy back either—“I suppose you’ve found out he has another\nwife—as we’ve been sure all along.”“No. I only wish he had,” said Valancy. She was not suffering\nparticularly, but she was very tired. If only the explanations were all\nover and she were upstairs in her old, ugly room—alone. Just alone! The\nrattle of the beads on her mother’s sleeves, as they swung on the arms\nof the reed chair, almost drove her crazy. Nothing else was worrying\nher; but all at once it seemed that she simply could not endure that\nthin, insistent rattle.“My home, as I told you, is always open to you,” said Mrs. Frederick\nstonily, “but I can never forgive you.”Valancy gave a mirthless laugh.“I’d care very little for that if I could only forgive myself,” she\nsaid.“Come, come,” said Uncle Benjamin testily. But rather enjoying himself.\nHe felt he had Valancy under his thumb again. “We’ve had enough of\nmystery. What has happened? Why have you left that fellow? No doubt\nthere’s reason enough—but what particular reason is it?”"

  "content": "Valancy began to speak mechanically. She told her tale bluntly and\nbarely.“A year ago Dr. Trent told me I had angina pectoris and could not live\nlong. I wanted to have some—life—before I died. That’s why I went away.\nWhy I married Barney. And now I’ve found it is all a mistake. There is\nnothing wrong with my heart. I’ve got to live—and Barney only married\nme out of pity. So I have to leave him—free.”“God bless me!” said Uncle Benjamin. Cousin Stickles began to cry.“Valancy, if you’d only had confidence in your own mother——”“Yes, yes, I know,” said Valancy impatiently. “What’s the use of going\ninto that now? I can’t undo this year. God knows I wish I could. I’ve\ntricked Barney into marrying me—and he’s really Bernard Redfern. Dr.\nRedfern’s son, of Montreal. And his father wants him to go back to\nhim.”Uncle Benjamin made a queer sound. Cousin Stickles took her\nblack-bordered handkerchief away from her eyes and stared at Valancy. A\nqueer gleam suddenly shot into Mrs. Frederick’s stone-grey orbs.“Dr. Redfern—not the Purple Pill man?” she said.Valancy nodded. “He’s John Foster, too—the writer of those nature\nbooks.”“But—but—” Mrs. Frederick was visibly agitated, though not over the\nthought that she was the mother-in-law of John Foster—“_Dr. Redfern is\na millionaire_!”Uncle Benjamin shut his mouth with a snap.“Ten times over,” he said.Valancy nodded.“Yes. Barney left home years ago—because of—of some\ntrouble—some—disappointment. Now he will likely go back. So you see—I\nhad to come home. He doesn’t love me. I can’t hold him to a bond he was\ntricked into.”Uncle Benjamin looked incredibly sly.“Did he say so? Does he want to get rid of you?”“No. I haven’t seen him since I found out. But I tell you—he only\nmarried me out of pity—because I asked him to—because he thought it\nwould only be for a little while.”Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles both tried to speak, but Uncle\nBenjamin waved a hand at them and frowned portentously.“Let _me_ handle this,” wave and frown seemed to say.

Later on—I dare say we can find a way out\nof this.”“You think Barney can easily get a divorce, don’t you?” said Valancy\neagerly.Uncle Benjamin silenced with another wave the exclamation of horror he\nknew was trembling on Mrs. Frederick’s lips.“Trust to me, Valancy. Everything will arrange itself. Tell me this,\nDossie. Have you been happy up back? Was Sr.—Mr. Redfern good to you?”“I have been very happy and Barney was very good to me,” said Valancy,\nas if reciting a lesson. She remembered when she studied grammar at\nschool she had disliked the past and perfect tenses. They had always\nseemed so pathetic. “I have been”—it was all over and done with.“Then don’t worry, little girl.” How amazingly paternal Uncle Benjamin\nwas! “Your family will stand behind you. We’ll see what can be done.”“Thank you,” said Valancy dully. Really, it was quite decent of Uncle\nBenjamin. “Can I go and lie down a little while? I’m—I’m—tired.”“Of course you’re tired.” Uncle Benjamin patted her hand gently—very\ngently. “All worn out and nervous. Go and lie down, by all means.\nYou’ll see things in quite a different light after you’ve had a good\nsleep.”He held the door open. As she went through he whispered, “What is the\nbest way to keep a man’s love?”Valancy smiled wanly. But she had come back to the old life—the old\nshackles. “What?” she asked as meekly as of yore.“Not to return it,” said Uncle Benjamin with a chuckle. He shut the\ndoor and rubbed his hands. Nodded and smiled mysteriously round the\nroom.“Poor little Doss!” he said pathetically.“Do you really suppose that—Snaith—can actually be Dr. Redfern’s son?”\ngasped Mrs. Frederick.“I see no reason for doubting it. She says Dr. Redfern has been there.\nWhy, the man is rich as wedding-cake. Amelia, I’ve always believed\nthere was more in Doss than most people thought. You kept her down too\nmuch—repressed her. She never had a chance to show what was in her. And\nnow she’s landed a millionaire for a husband.”“But—” hesitated Mrs. Frederick, “he—he—they told terrible tales about\nhim.”"

It’s always been a\nmystery to me why people should be so ready to invent and circulate\nslanders about other people they know absolutely nothing about. I can’t\nunderstand why you paid so much attention to gossip and surmise. Just\nbecause he didn’t choose to mix up with everybody, people resented it.\nI was surprised to find what a decent fellow he seemed to be that time\nhe came into my store with Valancy. I discounted all the yarns then and\nthere.”“But he was seen dead drunk in Port Lawrence once,” said Cousin\nStickles. Doubtfully, yet as one very willing to be convinced to the\ncontrary.“Who saw him?” demanded Uncle Benjamin truculently. “Who saw him? Old\nJemmy Strang _said_ he saw him. I wouldn’t take old Jemmy Strang’s word\non oath. He’s too drunk himself half the time to see straight. He said\nhe saw him lying drunk on a bench in the Park. Pshaw! Redfern’s been\nasleep there. Don’t worry over _that_.”“But his clothes—and that awful old car—” said Mrs. Frederick\nuncertainly.“Eccentricities of genius,” declared Uncle Benjamin. “You heard Doss\nsay he was John Foster. I’m not up in literature myself, but I heard a\nlecturer from Toronto say that John Foster’s books had put Canada on\nthe literary map of the world.”“I—suppose—we must forgive her,” yielded Mrs. Frederick.“Forgive her!” Uncle Benjamin snorted. Really, Amelia was an incredibly\nstupid woman. No wonder poor Doss had gone sick and tired of living\nwith her. “Well, yes, I think you’d better forgive her! The question\nis—will Snaith forgive _us_!”“What if she persists in leaving him? You’ve no idea how stubborn she\ncan be,” said Mrs. Frederick."

If\nyou had put yourself to a little trouble years ago, Amelia, she would\nnot have bolted over the traces as she did. Just let her alone—don’t\nworry her with advice or questions till she’s ready to talk. She’s\nevidently run away in a panic because she’s afraid he’d be angry with\nher for fooling him. Most extraordinary thing of Trent to tell her such\na yarn! That’s what comes of going to strange doctors. Well, well, we\nmustn’t blame her too harshly, poor child. Redfern will come after her.\nIf he doesn’t, I’ll hunt him up and talk to him as man to man. He may\nbe a millionaire, but Valancy is a Stirling. He can’t repudiate her\njust because she was mistaken about her heart disease. Not likely he’ll\nwant to. Doss is a little overstrung. Bless me, I must get in the habit\nof calling her Valancy. She isn’t a baby any longer. Now, remember,\nAmelia. Be very kind and sympathetic.”It was something of a large order to expect Mrs. Frederick to be kind\nand sympathetic. But she did her best. When supper was ready she went\nup and asked Valancy if she wouldn’t like a cup of tea. Valancy, lying\non her bed, declined. She just wanted to be left alone for a while.\nMrs. Frederick left her alone. She did not even remind Valancy that her\nplight was the outcome of her own lack of daughterly respect and\nobedience. One could not—exactly—say things like that to the\ndaughter-in-law of a millionaire.CHAPTER XLIValancy looked dully about her old room. It, too, was so exactly the\nsame that it seemed almost impossible to believe in the changes that\nhad come to her since she had last slept in it. It\nseemed—somehow—indecent that it should be so much the same. There was\nQueen Louise everlastingly coming down the stairway, and nobody had let\nthe forlorn puppy in out of the rain. Here was the purple paper blind\nand the greenish mirror. Outside, the old carriage-shop with its\nblatant advertisements. Beyond it, the station with the same derelicts\nand flirtatious flappers.Here the old life waited for her, like some grim ogre that bided his\ntime and licked his chops. A monstrous horror of it suddenly possessed\nher. When night fell and she had undressed and got into bed, the\nmerciful numbness passed away and she lay in anguish and thought of her\nisland under the stars. The camp-fires—all their little household jokes\nand phrases and catch words—their furry beautiful cats—the lights\nagleam on the fairy islands—canoes skimming over Mistawis in the magic\nof morning—white birches shining among the dark spruces like beautiful\nwomen’s bodies—winter snows and rose-red sunset fires—lakes drunken\nwith moonshine—all the delights of her lost paradise. She would not let\nherself think of Barney. Only of these lesser things. She could not\nendure to think of Barney."

She\nrecalled all his friendly looks and quips and jests—his little\ncompliments—his caresses. She counted them all over as a woman might\ncount her jewels—not one did she miss from the first day they had met.\nThese memories were all she could have now. She shut her eyes and\nprayed.“Let me remember every one, God! Let me never forget one of them!”Yet it would be better to forget. This agony of longing and loneliness\nwould not be so terrible if one could forget. And Ethel Traverse. That\nshimmering witch woman with her white skin and black eyes and shining\nhair. The woman Barney had loved. The woman whom he still loved. Hadn’t\nhe told her he never changed his mind? Who was waiting for him in\nMontreal. Who was the right wife for a rich and famous man. Barney\nwould marry her, of course, when he got his divorce. How Valancy hated\nher! And envied her! Barney had said, “I love you,” to _her_. Valancy\nhad wondered what tone Barney would say “I love you” in—how his\ndark-blue eyes would look when he said it. Ethel Traverse knew. Valancy\nhated her for the knowledge—hated and envied her.“She can never have those hours in the Blue Castle. They are _mine_,”\nthought Valancy savagely. Ethel would never make strawberry jam or\ndance to old Abel’s fiddle or fry bacon for Barney over a camp-fire.\nShe would never come to the little Mistawis shack at all.What was Barney doing—thinking—feeling now? Had he come home and found\nher letter? Was he still angry with her? Or a little pitiful. Was he\nlying on their bed looking out on stormy Mistawis and listening to the\nrain streaming down on the roof? Or was he still wandering in the\nwilderness, raging at the predicament in which he found himself? Hating\nher? Pain took her and wrung her like some great pitiless giant. She\ngot up and walked the floor. Would morning never come to end this\nhideous night? And yet what could morning bring her? The old life\nwithout the old stagnation that was at least bearable. The old life\nwith the new memories, the new longings, the new anguish.“Oh, why can’t I die?” moaned Valancy.CHAPTER XLII"

A\nhatless man sprang from it and rushed up the steps. The bell was rung\nas it had never been rung before—vehemently, intensely. The ringer was\ndemanding entrance, not asking it. Uncle Benjamin chuckled as he\nhurried to the door. Uncle Benjamin had “just dropped in” to enquire\nhow dear Doss—Valancy was. Dear Doss—Valancy, he had been informed, was\njust the same. She had come down for breakfast—which she didn’t\neat—gone back to her room, come down for dinner—which she didn’t\neat—gone back to her room. That was all. She had not talked. And she\nhad been let, kindly, considerately, alone.“Very good. Redfern will be here today,” said Uncle Benjamin. And now\nUncle Benjamin’s reputation as a prophet was made. Redfern was\nhere—unmistakably so.“Is my wife here?” he demanded of Uncle Benjamin without preface.Uncle Benjamin smiled expressively.“Mr. Redfern, I believe? Very glad to meet you, sir. Yes, that naughty\nlittle girl of yours is here. We have been——”“I must see her,” Barney cut Uncle Benjamin ruthlessly short.“Certainly, Mr. Redfern. Just step in here. Valancy will be down in a\nminute.”He ushered Barney into the parlour and betook himself to the\nsitting-room and Mrs. Frederick.“Go up and tell Valancy to come down. Her husband is here.”But so dubious was Uncle Benjamin as to whether Valancy could really\ncome down in a minute—or at all—that he followed Mrs. Frederick on\ntiptoe up the stairs and listened in the hall.“Valancy dear,” said Mrs. Frederick tenderly, “your husband is in the\nparlour, asking for you.”“Oh, Mother.” Valancy got up from the window and wrung her hands. “I\ncannot see him—I cannot! Tell him to go away—_ask_ him to go away. I\ncan’t see him!”“Tell her,” hissed Uncle Benjamin through the keyhole, “that Redfern\nsays he won’t go away until he _has_ seen her.”Redfern had not said anything of the kind, but Uncle Benjamin thought\nhe was that sort of a fellow. Valancy knew he was. She understood that\nshe might as well go down first as last.She did not even look at Uncle Benjamin as she passed him on the\nlanding. Uncle Benjamin did not mind. Rubbing his hands and chuckling,\nhe retreated to the kitchen, where he genially demanded of Cousin\nStickles:“Why are good husbands like bread?”Cousin Stickles asked why.“Because women need them,” beamed Uncle Benjamin.Valancy was looking anything but beautiful when she entered the\nparlour. Her white night had played fearful havoc with her face. She\nwore an ugly old brown-and-blue gingham, having left all her pretty\ndresses in the Blue Castle. But Barney dashed across the room and\ncaught her in his arms."

Don’t you know——”“I know you only married me out of pity,” said Valancy, brushing him\naway feebly. “I know you don’t love me—I know——”“You’ve been lying awake at three o’clock too long,” said Barney,\nshaking her. “That’s all that’s the matter with you.

Wasn’t it rubbed into me for years?”Barney laughed bitterly and strode up and down the room a few times.\nUncle Benjamin, tiptoeing through the hall, heard the laugh and\nfrowned. Surely Doss wasn’t going to be a stubborn little fool. Barney\nthrew himself into a chair before Valancy.“Yes. As long as I can remember I’ve been a millionaire’s son. But when\nI was born Dad wasn’t a millionaire. He wasn’t even a doctor—isn’t yet.\nHe was a veterinary and a failure at it. He and Mother lived in a\nlittle village up in Quebec and were abominably poor. I don’t remember\nMother. Haven’t even a picture of her. She died when I was two years\nold. She was fifteen years younger than Father—a little school teacher.\nWhen she died Dad moved into Montreal and formed a company to sell his\nhair tonic. He’d dreamed the prescription one night, it seems. Well, it\ncaught on. Money began to flow in. Dad invented—or dreamed—the other\nthings, too—Pills, Bitters, Liniment and so on. He was a millionaire by\nthe time I was ten, with a house so big a small chap like myself always\nfelt lost in it. I had every toy a boy could wish for—and I was the\nloneliest little devil in the world. I remember only one happy day in\nmy childhood, Valancy. Only one. Even you were better off than that.\nDad had gone out to see an old friend in the country and took me along.\nI was turned loose in the barnyard and I spent the whole day hammering\nnails in a block of wood. I had a glorious day. When I had to go back\nto my roomful of playthings in the big house in Montreal I cried. But I\ndidn’t tell Dad why. I never told him anything. It’s always been a hard\nthing for me to tell things, Valancy—anything that went deep. And most\nthings went deep with me. I was a sensitive child and I was even more\nsensitive as a boy.

Oh, it was clever—damnably so—and witty. McGill\nrocked with laughter over it. I found out _he_ had written it.”“Oh, were you sure?” Valancy’s dull eyes flamed with indignation.“Yes. He admitted it when I asked him. Said a good idea was worth more\nto him than a friend, any time. And he added a gratuitous thrust. ‘You\nknow, Redfern, there are some things money won’t buy. For instance—it\nwon’t buy you a grandfather.’ Well, it was a nasty slam. I was young\nenough to feel cut up. And it destroyed a lot of my ideals and\nillusions, which was the worst thing about it. I was a young\nmisanthrope after that. Didn’t want to be friends with any one. And\nthen—the year after I left college—I met Ethel Traverse.”Valancy shivered. Barney, his hands stuck in his pockets, was regarding\nthe floor moodily and didn’t notice it.“Dad told you about her, I suppose. She was very beautiful. And I loved\nher. Oh, yes, I loved her. I won’t deny it or belittle it now. It was a\nlonely, romantic boy’s first passionate love, and it was very real. And\nI thought she loved me. I was fool enough to think that. I was wildly\nhappy when she promised to marry me. For a few months. Then—I found out\nshe didn’t. I was an involuntary eavesdropper on a certain occasion for\na moment. That moment was enough. The proverbial fate of the\neavesdropper overtook me. A girl friend of hers was asking her how she\ncould stomach Doc. Redfern’s son and the patent-medicine background.“‘His money will gild the Pills and sweeten the Bitters,’ said Ethel,\nwith a laugh. ‘Mother told me to catch him if I could. We’re on the\nrocks. But pah! I smell turpentine whenever he comes near me.’”“Oh, Barney!” cried Valancy, wrung with pity for him. She had forgotten\nall about herself and was filled with compassion for Barney and rage\nagainst Ethel Traverse. How dared she?"

  "content": "“Well,”—Barney got up and began pacing round the room—“that finished\nme. Completely. I left civilisation and those accursed dopes behind me\nand went to the Yukon. For five years I knocked about the world—in all\nsorts of outlandish places. I earned enough to live on—I wouldn’t touch\na cent of Dad’s money. Then one day I woke up to the fact that I no\nlonger cared a hang about Ethel, one way or another. She was somebody\nI’d known in another world—that was all. But I had no hankering to go\nback to the old life. None of that for me. I was free and I meant to\nkeep so. I came to Mistawis—saw Tom MacMurray’s island. My first book\nhad been published the year before, and made a hit—I had a bit of money\nfrom my royalties. I bought my island. But I kept away from people. I\nhad no faith in anybody. I didn’t believe there was such a thing as\nreal friendship or true love in the world—not for me, anyhow—the son of\nPurple Pills. I used to revel in all the wild yarns they told of me. In\nfact, I’m afraid I suggested a few of them myself. By mysterious\nremarks which people interpreted in the light of their own\nprepossessions.“Then—you came. I _had_ to believe you loved me—really loved _me_—not\nmy father’s millions. There was no other reason why you should want to\nmarry a penniless devil with my supposed record. And I was sorry for\nyou. Oh, yes, I don’t deny I married you because I was sorry for you.\nAnd then—I found you the best and jolliest and dearest little pal and\nchum a fellow ever had. Witty—loyal—sweet. You made me believe again in\nthe reality of friendship and love. The world seemed good again just\nbecause you were in it, honey. I’d have been willing to go on forever\njust as we were. I knew that, the night I came home and saw my\nhomelight shining out from the island for the first time. And knew you\nwere there waiting for me. After being homeless all my life it was\nbeautiful to have a home. To come home hungry at night and know there\nwas a good supper and a cheery fire—and _you_.“But I didn’t realise what you actually meant to me till that moment at\nthe switch. Then it came like a lightning flash. I knew I couldn’t live\nwithout you—that if I couldn’t pull you loose in time I’d have to die\nwith you. I admit it bowled me over—knocked me silly. I couldn’t get my\nbearings for a while. That’s why I acted like a mule. But the thought\nthat drove me to the tall timber was the awful one that you were going\nto die. I’d always hated the thought of it—but I supposed there wasn’t\nany chance for you, so I put it out of my mind. Now I had to face\nit—you were under sentence of death and I couldn’t live without you.\nWhen I came home last night I had made up my mind that I’d take you to\nall the specialists in the world—that something surely could be done\nfor you. I felt sure you couldn’t be as bad as Dr. Trent thought, when\nthose moments on the track hadn’t even hurt you. And I found your\nnote—and went mad with happiness—and a little terror for fear you\ndidn’t care much for me, after all, and had gone away to get rid of me.\nBut now, it’s all right, isn’t it, darling?”"

  "content": "Was she, Valancy being called “darling”?“I _can’t_ believe you care for me,” she said helplessly. “I _know_ you\ncan’t. What’s the use, Barney? Of course, you’re sorry for me—of course\nyou want to do the best you can to straighten out the mess. But it\ncan’t be straightened out that way. You couldn’t love me—me.” She stood\nup and pointed tragically to the mirror over the mantel. Certainly, not\neven Allan Tierney could have seen beauty in the woeful, haggard little\nface reflected there.Barney didn’t look at the mirror. He looked at Valancy as if he would\nlike to snatch her—or beat her.“Love you! Girl, you’re in the very core of my heart. I hold you there\nlike a jewel. Didn’t I promise you I’d never tell you a lie? Love you!\nI love you with all there is of me to love. Heart, soul, brain. Every\nfibre of body and spirit thrilling to the sweetness of you. There’s\nnobody in the world for me but you, Valancy.”“You’re—a good actor, Barney,” said Valancy, with a wan little smile.Barney looked at her.“So you don’t believe me—yet?”“I—can t.”“Oh—damn!” said Barney violently.Valancy looked up startled. She had never seen _this_ Barney. Scowling!\nEyes black with anger. Sneering lips. Dead-white face.“You don’t want to believe it,” said Barney in the silk-smooth voice of\nultimate rage. “You’re tired of me. You want to get out of it—free from\nme. You’re ashamed of the Pills and the Liniment, just as she was. Your\nStirling pride can’t stomach them. It was all right as long as you\nthought you hadn’t long to live. A good lark—you could put up with me.\nBut a lifetime with old Doc Redfern’s son is a different thing. Oh, I\nunderstand—perfectly. I’ve been very dense—but I understand, at last.”Valancy stood up. She stared into his furious face. Then—she suddenly\nlaughed.“You darling!” she said. “You do mean it! You do really love me! You\nwouldn’t be so enraged if you didn’t.”Barney stared at her for a moment. Then he caught her in his arms with\nthe little low laugh of the triumphant lover."

To her that had should\ncertainly be given.Mrs. Frederick, returning to her comfortable belief in an overruling\nProvidence, got out the family Bible and made an entry under\n“Marriages.”CHAPTER XLIII“But, Barney,” protested Valancy after a few minutes, “your\nfather—somehow—gave me to understand that you _still_ loved _her_.”“He would. Dad holds the championship for making blunders. If there’s a\nthing that’s better left unsaid you can trust him to say it. But he\nisn’t a bad old soul, Valancy. You’ll like him.”“I do, now.”“And his money isn’t tainted money. He made it honestly. His medicines\nare quite harmless. Even his Purple Pills do people whole heaps of good\nwhen they believe in them.”“But—I’m not fit for your life,” sighed Valancy. “I’m not—clever—or\nwell-educated—or——”“My life is in Mistawis—and all the wild places of the world.

It has a\nwhite marble stairway with gilt bannisters and looks like a furniture\nshop with the labels off. Likewise it’s the pride of Dad’s heart. We’ll\nget a little house somewhere outside of Montreal—in the real\ncountry—near enough to see Dad often. I think we’ll build one for\nourselves. A house you build for yourself is so much nicer than a\nhand-me-down. But we’ll spend our summers in Mistawis. And our autumns\ntravelling. I want you to see the Alhambra—it’s the nearest thing to\nthe Blue Castle of your dreams I can think of. And there’s an old-world\ngarden in Italy where I want to show you the moon rising over Rome\nthrough the dark cypress-trees.”“Will that be any lovelier than the moon rising over Mistawis?”“Not lovelier. But a different kind of loveliness. There are so many\nkinds of loveliness. Valancy, before this year you’ve spent all your\nlife in ugliness. You know nothing of the beauty of the world. We’ll\nclimb mountains—hunt for treasures in the bazaars of Samarcand—search\nout the magic of east and west—run hand in hand to the rim of the\nworld. I want to show you it all—see it again through your eyes. Girl,\nthere are a million things I want to show you—do with you—say to you.\nIt will take a lifetime. And we must see about that picture by Tierney,\nafter all.”“Will you promise me one thing?” asked Valancy solemnly.“Anything,” said Barney recklessly.“Only one thing. You are never, under any circumstances or under any\nprovocation, to cast it up to me that I asked you to marry me.”CHAPTER XLIVE_xtract from letter written by Miss Olive Stirling to Mr. Cecil\nBruce:_“It’s really disgusting that Doss’ crazy adventures should have turned\nout like this. It makes one feel that there is no use in behaving\nproperly.“I’m _sure_ her mind was unbalanced when she left home. What she said\nabout a dust-pile showed that. Of course I don’t think there was ever a\nthing the matter with her heart. Or perhaps Snaith or Redfern or\nwhatever his name really is fed Purple Pills to her, back in that\nMistawis hut and cured her. It would make quite a testimonial for the\nfamily ads, wouldn’t it?“He’s such an insignificent-looking creature. I mentioned this to Doss\nbut all she said was, ‘I don’t like collar ad men.’“Well, he’s certainly no collar ad man. Though I must say there is\nsomething rather distinguished about him, now that he has cut his hair\nand put on decent clothes. I really think, Cecil, you should exercise\nmore. It doesn’t do to get too fleshy.“He also claims, I believe, to be John Foster. We can believe _that_ or\nnot, as we like, I suppose."
