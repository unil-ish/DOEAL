  "content": "“Oh, no, nothing serious,” agreed Valancy. She felt a little less\nhumiliated. It was no wonder poor Dr. Trent had forgotten her at such a\nmoment. Nevertheless, she felt very flat and discouraged as she went\ndown the street.Valancy went home by the short-cut of Lover’s Lane. She did not often\ngo through Lover’s Lane—but it was getting near supper-time and it\nwould never do to be late. Lover’s Lane wound back of the village,\nunder great elms and maples, and deserved its name. It was hard to go\nthere at any time and not find some canoodling couple—or young girls in\npairs, arms intertwined, earnestly talking over their little secrets.\nValancy didn’t know which made her feel more self-conscious and\nuncomfortable.This evening she encountered both. She met Connie Hale and Kate Bayley,\nin new pink organdy dresses with flowers stuck coquettishly in their\nglossy, bare hair. Valancy had never had a pink dress or worn flowers\nin her hair. Then she passed a young couple she didn’t know, dandering\nalong, oblivious to everything but themselves. The young man’s arm was\naround the girl’s waist quite shamelessly. Valancy had never walked\nwith a man’s arm about her. She felt that she ought to be shocked—they\nmight leave that sort of thing for the screening twilight, at least—but\nshe wasn’t shocked. In another flash of desperate, stark honesty she\nowned to herself that she was merely envious. When she passed them she\nfelt quite sure they were laughing at her—pitying her—“there’s that\nqueer little old maid, Valancy Stirling. They say she never had a beau\nin her whole life”—Valancy fairly ran to get out of Lover’s Lane. Never\nhad she felt so utterly colourless and skinny and insignificant.Just where Lover’s Lane debouched on the street, an old car was parked.\nValancy knew that car well—by sound, at least—and everybody in Deerwood\nknew it. This was before the phrase “tin Lizzie” had come into\ncirculation—in Deerwood, at least; but if it had been known, this car\nwas the tinniest of Lizzies—though it was not a Ford but an old Grey\nSlosson. Nothing more battered and disreputable could be imagined."

  "content": "It was Barney Snaith’s car and Barney himself was just scrambling up\nfrom under it, in overalls plastered with mud. Valancy gave him a\nswift, furtive look as she hurried by. This was only the second time\nshe had ever seen the notorious Barney Snaith, though she had heard\nenough about him in the five years that he had been living “up back” in\nMuskoka. The first time had been nearly a year ago, on the Muskoka\nroad. He had been crawling out from under his car then, too, and he had\ngiven her a cheerful grin as she went by—a little, whimsical grin that\ngave him the look of an amused gnome. He didn’t look bad—she didn’t\nbelieve he was bad, in spite of the wild yarns that were always being\ntold of him. Of course he went tearing in that terrible old Grey\nSlosson through Deerwood at hours when all decent people were in\nbed—often with old “Roaring Abel,” who made the night hideous with his\nhowls—“both of them dead drunk, my dear.” And every one knew that he\nwas an escaped convict and a defaulting bank clerk and a murderer in\nhiding and an infidel and an illegitimate son of old Roaring Abel Gay\nand the father of Roaring Abel’s illegitimate grandchild and a\ncounterfeiter and a forger and a few other awful things. But still\nValancy didn’t believe he was bad. Nobody with a smile like that could\nbe bad, no matter what he had done.It was that night the Prince of the Blue Castle changed from a being of\ngrim jaw and hair with a dash of premature grey to a rakish individual\nwith overlong, tawny hair, dashed with red, dark-brown eyes, and ears\nthat stuck out just enough to give him an alert look but not enough to\nbe called flying jibs. But he still retained something a little grim\nabout the jaw.Barney Snaith looked even more disreputable than usual just now. It was\nvery evident that he hadn’t shaved for days, and his hands and arms,\nbare to the shoulders, were black with grease. But he was whistling\ngleefully to himself and he seemed so happy that Valancy envied him.\nShe envied him his light-heartedness and his irresponsibility and his\nmysterious little cabin up on an island in Lake Mistawis—even his\nrackety old Grey Slosson. Neither he nor his car had to be respectable\nand live up to traditions. When he rattled past her a few minutes\nlater, bareheaded, leaning back in his Lizzie at a raffish angle, his\nlongish hair blowing in the wind, a villainous-looking old black pipe\nin his mouth, she envied him again. Men had the best of it, no doubt\nabout that. This outlaw was happy, whatever he was or wasn’t. She,\nValancy Stirling, respectable, well-behaved to the last degree, was\nunhappy and had always been unhappy. So there you were.Valancy was just in time for supper. The sun had clouded over, and a\ndismal, drizzling rain was falling again. Cousin Stickles had the\nneuralgia. Valancy had to do the family darning and there was no time\nfor _Magic of Wings_.“Can’t the darning wait till tomorrow?” she pleaded.“Tomorrow will bring its own duties,” said Mrs. Frederick inexorably."

They discussed\nSecond Cousin Lilian’s approaching wedding in all its bearings. On the\nwhole, they approved. Second Cousin Lilian was doing well for herself.“Though she hasn’t hurried,” said Cousin Stickles. “She must be\ntwenty-five.”“There have not—fortunately—been many old maids in our connection,”\nsaid Mrs. Frederick bitterly.Valancy flinched. She had run the darning needle into her finger.Third Cousin Aaron Gray had been scratched by a cat and had\nblood-poisoning in his finger. “Cats are most dangerous animals,” said\nMrs. Frederick. “I would never have a cat about the house.”She glared significantly at Valancy through her terrible glasses. Once,\nfive years ago, Valancy had asked if she might have a cat. She had\nnever referred to it since, but Mrs. Frederick still suspected her of\nharbouring the unlawful desire in her heart of hearts.Once Valancy sneezed. Now, in the Stirling code, it was very bad form\nto sneeze in public.“You can always repress a sneeze by pressing your finger on your upper\nlip,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.Half-past nine o’clock and so, as Mr. Pepys would say, to bed. But\nFirst Cousin Stickles’ neuralgic back must be rubbed with Redfern’s\nLiniment. Valancy did that. Valancy always had to do it. She hated the\nsmell of Redfern’s Liniment—she hated the smug, beaming, portly,\nbe-whiskered, be-spectacled picture of Dr. Redfern on the bottle. Her\nfingers smelled of the horrible stuff after she got into bed, in spite\nof all the scrubbing she gave them.Valancy’s day of destiny had come and gone. She ended it as she had\nbegun it, in tears.CHAPTER VII"

  "content": "There was a rosebush on the little Stirling lawn, growing beside the\ngate. It was called “Doss’s rosebush.” Cousin Georgiana had given it to\nValancy five years ago and Valancy had planted it joyfully. She loved\nroses. But—of course—the rosebush never bloomed. That was her luck.\nValancy did everything she could think of and took the advice of\neverybody in the clan, but still the rosebush would not bloom. It\nthrove and grew luxuriantly, with great leafy branches untouched of\nrust or spider; but not even a bud had ever appeared on it. Valancy,\nlooking at it two days after her birthday, was filled with a sudden,\noverwhelming hatred for it. The thing wouldn’t bloom: very well, then,\nshe would cut it down. She marched to the tool-room in the barn for her\ngarden knife and she went at the rosebush viciously. A few minutes\nlater horrified Mrs. Frederick came out to the verandah and beheld her\ndaughter slashing insanely among the rosebush boughs. Half of them were\nalready strewn on the walk. The bush looked sadly dismantled.“Doss, what on earth are you doing? Have you gone crazy?”“No,” said Valancy. She meant to say it defiantly, but habit was too\nstrong for her. She said it deprecatingly. “I—I just made up my mind to\ncut this bush down. It is no good. It never blooms—never will bloom.”“That is no reason for destroying it,” said Mrs. Frederick sternly. “It\nwas a beautiful bush and quite ornamental. You have made a\nsorry-looking thing of it.”“Rose trees should _bloom_,” said Valancy a little obstinately.“Don’t argue with _me_, Doss. Clear up that mess and leave the bush\nalone. I don’t know what Georgiana will say when she sees how you have\nhacked it to pieces. Really, I’m surprised at you. And to do it without\nconsulting _me_!”“The bush is mine,” muttered Valancy.“What’s that? What did you say, Doss?”“I only said the bush was mine,” repeated Valancy humbly.Mrs. Frederick turned without a word and marched back into the house.\nThe mischief was done now. Valancy knew she had offended her mother\ndeeply and would not be spoken to or noticed in any way for two or\nthree days. Cousin Stickles would see to Valancy’s bringing-up but Mrs.\nFrederick would preserve the stony silence of outraged majesty.Valancy sighed and put away her garden knife, hanging it precisely on\nits precise nail in the tool-shop. She cleared away the severed\nbranches and swept up the leaves. Her lips twitched as she looked at\nthe straggling bush. It had an odd resemblance to its shaken, scrawny\ndonor, little Cousin Georgiana herself.“I certainly have made an awful-looking thing of it,” thought Valancy.But she did not feel repentant—only sorry she had offended her mother.\nThings would be so uncomfortable until she was forgiven. Mrs. Frederick\nwas one of those women who can make their anger felt all over a house.\nWalls and doors are no protection from it."

  "content": "“You’d better go uptown and git the mail,” said Cousin Stickles, when\nValancy went in. “_I_ can’t go—I feel all sorter peaky and piny this\nspring. I want you to stop at the drugstore and git me a bottle of\nRedfern’s Blood Bitters. There’s nothing like Redfern’s Bitters for\nbuilding a body up. Cousin James says the Purple Pills are the best,\nbut I know better. My poor dear husband took Redfern’s Bitters right up\nto the day he died. Don’t let them charge you more’n ninety cents. I\nkin git it for that at the Port. And what _have_ you been saying to\nyour poor mother? Do you ever stop to think, Doss, that you kin only\nhave one mother?”“One is enough for me,” thought Valancy undutifully, as she went\nuptown.She got Cousin Stickles’ bottle of bitters and then she went to the\npost-office and asked for her mail at the General Delivery. Her mother\ndid not have a box. They got too little mail to bother with it. Valancy\ndid not expect any mail, except the _Christian Times_, which was the\nonly paper they took. They hardly ever got any letters. But Valancy\nrather liked to stand in the office and watch Mr. Carewe, the\ngrey-bearded, Santa-Clausy old clerk, handing out letters to the lucky\npeople who did get them. He did it with such a detached, impersonal,\nJove-like air, as if it did not matter in the least to him what\nsupernal joys or shattering horrors might be in those letters for the\npeople to whom they were addressed. Letters had a fascination for\nValancy, perhaps because she so seldom got any. In her Blue Castle\nexciting epistles, bound with silk and sealed with crimson, were always\nbeing brought to her by pages in livery of gold and blue, but in real\nlife her only letters were occasional perfunctory notes from relatives\nor an advertising circular.Consequently she was immensely surprised when Mr. Carewe, looking even\nmore Jovian than usual, poked a letter out to her. Yes, it was\naddressed to her plainly, in a fierce, black hand: “Miss Valancy\nStirling, Elm Street, Deerwood”—and the postmark was Montreal. Valancy\npicked it up with a little quickening of her breath. Montreal! It must\nbe from Doctor Trent. He had remembered her, after all.Valancy met Uncle Benjamin coming in as she was going out and was glad\nthe letter was safely in her bag.“What,” said Uncle Benjamin, “is the difference between a donkey and a\npostage-stamp?”“I don’t know. What?” answered Valancy dutifully.“One you lick with a stick and the other you stick with a lick. Ha,\nha!”Uncle Benjamin passed in, tremendously pleased with himself."

  "content": "Cousin Stickles pounced on the _Times_ when Valancy got home, but it\ndid not occur to her to ask if there were any letters. Mrs. Frederick\nwould have asked it, but Mrs. Frederick’s lips at present were sealed.\nValancy was glad of this. If her mother had asked if there were any\nletters Valancy would have had to admit there was. Then she would have\nhad to let her mother and Cousin Stickles read the letter and all would\nbe discovered.Her heart acted strangely on the way upstairs, and she sat down by her\nwindow for a few minutes before opening her letter. She felt very\nguilty and deceitful. She had never before kept a letter secret from\nher mother. Every letter she had ever written or received had been read\nby Mrs. Frederick. That had never mattered. Valancy had never had\nanything to hide. But this _did_ matter. She could not have any one see\nthis letter. But her fingers trembled with a consciousness of\nwickedness and unfilial conduct as she opened it—trembled a little,\ntoo, perhaps, with apprehension. She felt quite sure there was nothing\nseriously wrong with her heart but—one never knew.Dr. Trent’s letter was like himself—blunt, abrupt, concise, wasting no\nwords. Dr. Trent never beat about the bush. “Dear Miss Sterling”—and\nthen a page of black, positive writing. Valancy seemed to read it at a\nglance; she dropped it on her lap, her face ghost-white.Dr. Trent told her that she had a very dangerous and fatal form of\nheart disease—angina pectoris—evidently complicated with an\naneurism—whatever that was—and in the last stages. He said, without\nmincing matters, that nothing could be done for her. If she took great\ncare of herself she might live a year—but she might also die at any\nmoment—Dr. Trent never troubled himself about euphemisms. She must be\ncareful to avoid all excitement and all severe muscular efforts. She\nmust eat and drink moderately, she must never run, she must go upstairs\nand uphill with great care. Any sudden jolt or shock might be fatal.\nShe was to get the prescription he enclosed filled and carry it with\nher always, taking a dose whenever her attacks came on. And he was hers\ntruly, H. B. Trent."

  "content": "Valancy sat for a long while by her window. Outside was a world drowned\nin the light of a spring afternoon—skies entrancingly blue, winds\nperfumed and free, lovely, soft, blue hazes at the end of every street.\nOver at the railway station a group of young girls was waiting for a\ntrain; she heard their gay laughter as they chattered and joked. The\ntrain roared in and roared out again. But none of these things had any\nreality. Nothing had any reality except the fact that she had only\nanother year to live.When she was tired of sitting at the window she went over and lay down\non her bed, staring at the cracked, discoloured ceiling. The curious\nnumbness that follows on a staggering blow possessed her. She did not\nfeel anything except a boundless surprise and incredulity—behind which\nwas the conviction that Dr. Trent knew his business and that she,\nValancy Stirling, who had never lived, was about to die.When the gong rang for supper Valancy got up and went downstairs\nmechanically, from force of habit. She wondered that she had been let\nalone so long. But of course her mother would not pay any attention to\nher just now. Valancy was thankful for this. She thought the quarrel\nover the rosebush had been really, as Mrs. Frederick herself might have\nsaid, Providential. She could not eat anything, but both Mrs. Frederick\nand Cousin Stickles thought this was because she was deservedly unhappy\nover her mother’s attitude, and her lack of appetite was not commented\non. Valancy forced herself to swallow a cup of tea and then sat and\nwatched the others eat, with an odd feeling that years had passed since\nshe had sat with them at the dinner-table. She found herself smiling\ninwardly to think what a commotion she could make if she chose. Let her\nmerely tell them what was in Dr. Trent’s letter and there would be as\nmuch fuss made as if—Valancy thought bitterly—they really cared two\nstraws about her.“Dr. Trent’s housekeeper got word from him today,” said Cousin\nStickles, so suddenly that Valancy jumped guiltily. Was there anything\nin thought waves? “Mrs. Judd was talking to her uptown. They think his\nson will recover, but Dr. Trent wrote that if he did he was going to\ntake him abroad as soon as he was able to travel and wouldn’t be back\nhere for a year at least.”“That will not matter much to _us_,” said Mrs. Frederick majestically.\n“He is not _our_ doctor. I would not”—here she looked or seemed to look\naccusingly right through Valancy—“have _him_ to doctor a sick cat.”"

The question had to be asked. Valancy could not be\nallowed to have headaches without interference.“You ain’t in the habit of having headaches. I hope you’re not taking\nthe mumps. Here, try a spoonful of vinegar.”“Piffle!” said Valancy rudely, getting up from the table. She did not\ncare just then if she were rude. She had had to be so polite all her\nlife.If it had been possible for Cousin Stickles to turn pale she would\nhave. As it was not, she turned yellower.“Are you sure you ain’t feverish, Doss? You sound like it. You go and\nget right into bed,” said Cousin Stickles, thoroughly alarmed, “and\nI’ll come up and rub your forehead and the back of your neck with\nRedfern’s Liniment.”Valancy had reached the door, but she turned. “I won’t be rubbed with\nRedfern’s Liniment!” she said.Cousin Stickles stared and gasped. “What—what do you mean?”“I said I wouldn’t be rubbed with Redfern’s Liniment,” repeated\nValancy. “Horrid, sticky stuff! And it has the vilest smell of any\nliniment I ever saw. It’s no good. I want to be left alone, that’s\nall.”Valancy went out, leaving Cousin Stickles aghast.“She’s feverish—she _must_ be feverish,” ejaculated Cousin Stickles.Mrs. Frederick went on eating her supper. It did not matter whether\nValancy was or was not feverish. Valancy had been guilty of\nimpertinence to _her_.CHAPTER VIII"

She made a discovery that surprised her:\nshe, who had been afraid of almost everything in life, was not afraid\nof death. It did not seem in the least terrible to her. And she need\nnot now be afraid of anything else. Why had she been afraid of things?\nBecause of life. Afraid of Uncle Benjamin because of the menace of\npoverty in old age. But now she would never be old—neglected—tolerated.\nAfraid of being an old maid all her life. But now she would not be an\nold maid very long. Afraid of offending her mother and her clan because\nshe had to live with and among them and couldn’t live peaceably if she\ndidn’t give in to them. But now she hadn’t. Valancy felt a curious\nfreedom.But she was still horribly afraid of one thing—the fuss the whole\njamfry of them would make when she told them. Valancy shuddered at the\nthought of it. She couldn’t endure it. Oh, she knew so well how it\nwould be. First there would be indignation—yes, indignation on the part\nof Uncle James because she had gone to a doctor—any doctor—without\nconsulting HIM. Indignation on the part of her mother for being so sly\nand deceitful—“to your own mother, Doss.” Indignation on the part of\nthe whole clan because she had not gone to Dr. Marsh.Then would come the solicitude. She would be taken to Dr. Marsh, and\nwhen Dr. Marsh confirmed Dr. Trent’s diagnosis she would be taken to\nspecialists in Toronto and Montreal. Uncle Benjamin would foot the bill\nwith a splendid gesture of munificence in thus assisting the widow and\norphan, and talk forever after of the shocking fees specialists charged\nfor looking wise and saying they couldn’t do anything. And when the\nspecialists could do nothing for her Uncle James would insist on her\ntaking Purple Pills—“I’ve known them to effect a cure when _all_ the\ndoctors had given up”—and her mother would insist on Redfern’s Blood\nBitters, and Cousin Stickles would insist on rubbing her over the heart\nevery night with Redfern’s Liniment on the grounds that it _might_ do\ngood and _couldn’t_ do harm; and everybody else would have some pet\ndope for her to take. Dr. Stalling would come to her and say solemnly,\n“You are very ill. Are you prepared for what may be before you?”—almost\nas if he were going to shake his forefinger at her, the forefinger that\nhad not grown any shorter or less knobbly with age. And she would be\nwatched and checked like a baby and never let do anything or go\nanywhere alone. Perhaps she would not even be allowed to sleep alone\nlest she die in her sleep. Cousin Stickles or her mother would insist\non sharing her room and bed. Yes, undoubtedly they would."

As the clock in the hall below struck\ntwelve Valancy suddenly and definitely made up her mind that she would\nnot tell anybody. She had always been told, ever since she could\nremember, that she must hide her feelings. “It is not ladylike to have\nfeelings,” Cousin Stickles had once told her disapprovingly. Well, she\nwould hide them with a vengeance.But though she was not afraid of death she was not indifferent to it.\nShe found that she _resented_ it; it was not fair that she should have\nto die when she had never lived. Rebellion flamed up in her soul as the\ndark hours passed by—not because she had no future but because she had\nno past.“I’m poor—I’m ugly—I’m a failure—and I’m near death,” she thought. She\ncould see her own obituary notice in the Deerwood _Weekly Times_,\ncopied into the Port Lawrence _Journal_. “A deep gloom was cast over\nDeerwood, etc., etc.”—“leaves a large circle of friends to mourn, etc.,\netc., etc.”—lies, all lies. Gloom, forsooth! Nobody would miss her. Her\ndeath would not matter a straw to anybody. Not even her mother loved\nher—her mother who had been so disappointed that she was not a boy—or\nat least, a pretty girl.Valancy reviewed her whole life between midnight and the early spring\ndawn. It was a very drab existence, but here and there an incident\nloomed out with a significance out of all proportion to its real\nimportance. These incidents were all unpleasant in one way or another.\nNothing really pleasant had ever happened to Valancy.“I’ve never had one wholly happy hour in my life—not one,” she thought.\n“I’ve just been a colourless nonentity. I remember reading somewhere\nonce that there is an hour in which a woman might be happy all her life\nif she could but find it. I’ve never found my hour—never, never. And I\nnever will now. If I could only have had that hour I’d be willing to\ndie.”"

  "content": "Those significant incidents kept bobbing up in her mind like unbidden\nghosts, without any sequence of time or place. For instance, that time\nwhen, at sixteen, she had blued a tubful of clothes too deeply. And the\ntime when, at eight, she had “stolen” some raspberry jam from Aunt\nWellington’s pantry. Valancy never heard the last of those two\nmisdemeanours. At almost every clan gathering they were raked up\nagainst her as jokes. Uncle Benjamin hardly ever missed re-telling the\nraspberry jam incident—he had been the one to catch her, her face all\nstained and streaked.“I have really done so few bad things that they have to keep harping on\nthe old ones,” thought Valancy. “Why, I’ve never even had a quarrel\nwith any one. I haven’t an enemy. What a spineless thing I must be not\nto have even one enemy!”There was that incident of the dust-pile at school when she was seven.\nValancy always recalled it when Dr. Stalling referred to the text, “To\nhim that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken\neven that which he hath.” Other people might puzzle over that text but\nit never puzzled Valancy. The whole relationship between herself and\nOlive, dating from the day of the dust-pile, was a commentary on it.She had been going to school a year, but Olive, who was a year younger,\nhad just begun and had about her all the glamour of “a new girl” and an\nexceedingly pretty girl at that. It was at recess and all the girls,\nbig and little, were out on the road in front of the school making\ndust-piles. The aim of each girl was to have the biggest pile. Valancy\nwas good at making dust-piles—there was an art in it—and she had secret\nhopes of leading. But Olive, working off by herself, was suddenly\ndiscovered to have a larger dust-pile than anybody. Valancy felt no\njealousy. Her dust-pile was quite big enough to please her. Then one of\nthe older girls had an inspiration.“Let’s put all our dust on Olive’s pile and make a tremendous one,” she\nexclaimed.A frenzy seemed to seize the girls. They swooped down on the dust-piles\nwith pails and shovels and in a few seconds Olive’s pile was a\nveritable pyramid. In vain Valancy, with scrawny, outstretched little\narms, tried to protect hers. She was ruthlessly swept aside, her\ndust-pile scooped up and poured on Olive’s. Valancy turned away\nresolutely and began building another dust-pile. Again a bigger girl\npounced on it. Valancy stood before it, flushed, indignant, arms\noutspread.“Don’t take it,” she pleaded. “Please don’t take it.”"

Valancy turned away, her heart swelling, her eyes\nfull of tears.“Jealous—you’re jealous!” said the girls mockingly.“You were very selfish,” said her mother coldly, when Valancy told her\nabout it at night. That was the first and last time Valancy had ever\ntaken any of her troubles to her mother.Valancy was neither jealous nor selfish. It was only that she wanted a\ndust-pile of her own—small or big mattered not. A team of horses came\ndown the street—Olive’s dust pile was scattered over the roadway—the\nbell rang—the girls trooped into school and had forgotten the whole\naffair before they reached their seats. Valancy never forgot it. To\nthis day she resented it in her secret soul. But was it not symbolical\nof her life?“I’ve never been able to have my own dust-pile,” thought Valancy.The enormous red moon she had seen rising right at the end of the\nstreet one autumn evening of her sixth year. She had been sick and cold\nwith the awful, uncanny horror of it. So near to her. So big. She had\nrun in trembling to her mother and her mother had laughed at her. She\nhad gone to bed and hidden her face under the clothes in terror lest\nshe might look at the window and see that horrible moon glaring in at\nher through it.The boy who had tried to kiss her at a party when she was fifteen. She\nhad not let him—she had evaded him and run. He was the only boy who had\never tried to kiss her. Now, fourteen years later, Valancy found\nherself wishing that she had let him.The time she had been made to apologise to Olive for something she\nhadn’t done. Olive had said that Valancy had pushed her into the mud\nand spoiled her new shoes _on purpose_. Valancy knew she hadn’t. It had\nbeen an accident—and even that wasn’t her fault—but nobody would\nbelieve her. She had to apologise—and kiss Olive to “make up.” The\ninjustice of it burned in her soul tonight."

People had thought Olive so sweet and\nunselfish.“I was an excellent foil for her,” thought Valancy. “Even then she knew\nthat.”Valancy had tried to win a prize for attendance in Sunday School once.\nBut Olive won it.

Olive was a good\nreciter and never got stuck.The night she had spent in Port Lawrence with Aunt Isabel when she was\nten. Byron Stirling was there; from Montreal, twelve years old,\nconceited, clever. At family prayers in the morning Byron had reached\nacross and given Valancy’s thin arm such a savage pinch that she\nscreamed out with pain. After prayers were over she was summoned to\nAunt Isabel’s bar of judgment. But when she said Byron had pinched her\nByron denied it. He said she cried out because the kitten scratched\nher.

Valancy was sent home in disgrace because of her\nexceedingly bad behavior during family prayers and she was not asked to\nAunt Isabel’s again for many moons.The time Cousin Betty Stirling was married. Somehow Valancy got wind of\nthe fact that Betty was going to ask her to be one of her bridesmaids.\nValancy was secretly uplifted. It would be a delightful thing to be a\nbridesmaid. And of course she would have to have a new dress for it—a\npretty new dress—a pink dress. Betty wanted her bridesmaids to dress in\npink.But Betty had never asked her, after all. Valancy couldn’t guess why,\nbut long after her secret tears of disappointment had been dried Olive\ntold her. Betty, after much consultation and reflection, had decided\nthat Valancy was too insignificant—she would “spoil the effect.” That\nwas nine years ago. But tonight Valancy caught her breath with the old\npain and sting of it."

Valancy had denied it for a\nlong time but eventually for peace’ sake she had given in and pleaded\nguilty. Mrs. Frederick was always making people lie by pushing them\ninto situations where they _had_ to lie. Then her mother had made her\nkneel down on the parlour floor, between herself and Cousin Stickles,\nand say, “O God, please forgive me for not speaking the truth.” Valancy\nhad said it, but as she rose from her knees she muttered. “But, O God,\n_you_ know I did speak the truth.” Valancy had not then heard of\nGalileo but her fate was similar to his. She was punished just as\nseverely as if she hadn’t confessed and prayed.The winter she went to dancing-school. Uncle James had decreed she\nshould go and had paid for her lessons. How she had looked forward to\nit! And how she had hated it! She had never had a voluntary partner.\nThe teacher always had to tell some boy to dance with her, and\ngenerally he had been sulky about it. Yet Valancy was a good dancer, as\nlight on her feet as thistledown. Olive, who never lacked eager\npartners, was heavy.The affair of the button-string, when she was ten. All the girls in\nschool had button-strings. Olive had a very long one with a great many\nbeautiful buttons. Valancy had one. Most of the buttons on it were very\ncommonplace, but she had six beauties that had come off Grandmother\nStirling’s wedding-gown—sparkling buttons of gold and glass, much more\nbeautiful than any Olive had. Their possession conferred a certain\ndistinction on Valancy. She knew every little girl in school envied her\nthe exclusive possession of those beautiful buttons. When Olive saw\nthem on the button-string she had looked at them narrowly but said\nnothing—then. The next day Aunt Wellington had come to Elm Street and\ntold Mrs. Frederick that she thought Olive should have some of those\nbuttons—Grandmother Stirling was just as much Wellington’s mother as\nFrederick’s. Mrs. Frederick had agreed amiably. She could not afford to\nfall out with Aunt Wellington. Moreover, the matter was of no\nimportance whatever. Aunt Wellington carried off four of the buttons,\ngenerously leaving two for Valancy. Valancy had torn these from her\nstring and flung them on the floor—she had not yet learned that it was\nunladylike to have feelings—and had been sent supperless to bed for the\nexhibition."

Rob Walker was to be there; and two nights\nbefore, on the moonlit verandah of Uncle Herbert’s cottage at Mistawis,\nRob had really seemed attracted to her. At Margaret’s party Rob never\neven asked her to dance—did not notice her at all. She was a\nwallflower, as usual. That, of course, was years ago. People in\nDeerwood had long since given up inviting Valancy to dances. But to\nValancy its humiliation and disappointment were of the other day. Her\nface burned in the darkness as she recalled herself, sitting there with\nher pitifully crimped, thin hair and the cheeks she had pinched for an\nhour before coming, in an effort to make them red. All that came of it\nwas a wild story that Valancy Stirling was rouged at Margaret Blunt’s\nparty. In those days in Deerwood that was enough to wreck your\ncharacter forever. It did not wreck Valancy’s, or even damage it.\nPeople knew _she_ couldn’t be fast if she tried. They only laughed at\nher.“I’ve had nothing but a second-hand existence,” decided Valancy. “All\nthe great emotions of life have passed me by. I’ve never even had a\ngrief. And have I ever really loved anybody? Do I really love Mother?\nNo, I don’t. That’s the truth, whether it is disgraceful or not. I\ndon’t love her—I’ve never loved her. What’s worse, I don’t even like\nher. So I don’t know anything about any kind of love. My life has been\nempty—empty. Nothing is worse than emptiness. Nothing!” Valancy\nejaculated the last “nothing” aloud passionately. Then she moaned and\nstopped thinking about anything for a while. One of her attacks of pain\nhad come on.When it was over something had happened to Valancy—perhaps the\nculmination of the process that had been going on in her mind ever\nsince she had read Dr. Trent’s letter. It was three o’clock in the\nmorning—the wisest and most accursed hour of the clock. But sometimes\nit sets us free.“I’ve been trying to please other people all my life and failed,” she\nsaid. “After this I shall please myself. I shall never pretend anything\nagain. I’ve breathed an atmosphere of fibs and pretences and evasions\nall my life. What a luxury it will be to tell the truth! I may not be\nable to do much that I want to do but I won’t do another thing that I\ndon’t want to do. Mother can pout for weeks—I shan’t worry over it.\n‘Despair is a free man—hope is a slave.’”Valancy got up and dressed, with a deepening of that curious sense of\nfreedom. When she had finished with her hair she opened the window and\nhurled the jar of potpourri over into the next lot. It smashed\ngloriously against the schoolgirl complexion on the old carriage-shop.“I’m sick of the fragrance of dead things,” said Valancy.CHAPTER IXUncle Herbert and Aunt Alberta’s silver wedding was delicately referred\nto among the Stirlings during the following weeks as “the time we first\nnoticed poor Valancy was—a little—you understand?”"

Uncle Benjamin was considered to have gone entirely\ntoo far when he had ejaculated, “She’s dippy—I tell you, she’s dippy,”\nand was only excused because of the outrageousness of Valancy’s conduct\nat the aforesaid wedding dinner.But Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles had noticed a few things that\nmade them uneasy _before_ the dinner. It had begun with the rosebush,\nof course; and Valancy never was really “quite right” again. She did\nnot seem to worry in the least over the fact that her mother was not\nspeaking to her. You would never suppose she noticed it at all. She had\nflatly refused to take either Purple Pills or Redfern’s Bitters. She\nhad announced coolly that she did not intend to answer to the name of\n“Doss” any longer. She had told Cousin Stickles that she wished she\nwould give up wearing that brooch with Cousin Artemas Stickles’ hair in\nit. She had moved her bed in her room to the opposite corner. She had\nread _Magic of Wings_ Sunday afternoon. When Cousin Stickles had\nrebuked her Valancy had said indifferently, “Oh, I forgot it was\nSunday”—and _had gone on reading it_.Cousin Stickles had seen a terrible thing—she had caught Valancy\nsliding down the bannister. Cousin Stickles did not tell Mrs. Frederick\nthis—poor Amelia was worried enough as it was. But it was Valancy’s\nannouncement on Saturday night that she was not going to go to the\nAnglican church any more that broke through Mrs. Frederick’s stony\nsilence.“Not going to church any more! Doss, have you absolutely taken leave——”“Oh, I’m going to church,” said Valancy airily. “I’m going to the\nPresbyterian church. But to the Anglican church I will not go.”This was even worse. Mrs. Frederick had recourse to tears, having found\noutraged majesty had ceased to be effective.“What have you got against the Anglican church?” she sobbed.“Nothing—only just that you’ve always made me go there. If you’d made\nme go to the Presbyterian church I’d want to go to the Anglican.”“Is that a nice thing to say to your mother? Oh, how true it is that it\nis sharper than a serpent’s tooth to have a thankless child.”“Is that a nice thing to say to your daughter?” said unrepentant\nValancy."

They\nwere doubtful about the wisdom of taking her, but concluded it would\n“make talk” if they didn’t. Perhaps she would behave herself, and so\nfar no outsider suspected there was anything queer about her. By a\nspecial mercy of Providence it had poured torrents Sunday morning, so\nValancy had not carried out her hideous threat of going to the\nPresbyterian church.Valancy would not have cared in the least if they had left her at home.\nThese family celebrations were all hopelessly dull. But the Stirlings\nalways celebrated everything. It was a long-established custom. Even\nMrs. Frederick gave a dinner party on her wedding anniversary and\nCousin Stickles had friends in to supper on her birthday. Valancy hated\nthese entertainments because they had to pinch and save and contrive\nfor weeks afterwards to pay for them. But she wanted to go to the\nsilver wedding. It would hurt Uncle Herbert’s feelings if she stayed\naway, and she rather liked Uncle Herbert. Besides, she wanted to look\nover all her relatives from her new angle. It would be an excellent\nplace to make public her declaration of independence if occasion\noffered.“Put on your brown silk dress,” said Mrs. Stirling.As if there were anything else to put on! Valancy had only the one\nfestive dress—that snuffy-brown silk Aunt Isabel had given her. Aunt\nIsabel had decreed that Valancy should never wear colours. They did not\nbecome her. When she was young they allowed her to wear white, but that\nhad been tacitly dropped for some years. Valancy put on the brown silk.\nIt had a high collar and long sleeves. She had never had a dress with\nlow neck and elbow sleeves, although they had been worn, even in\nDeerwood, for over a year. But she did not do her hair pompadour. She\nknotted it on her neck and pulled it out over her ears. She thought it\nbecame her—only the little knot was so absurdly small. Mrs. Frederick\nresented the hair but decided it was wisest to say nothing on the eve\nof the party. It was so important that Valancy should be kept in good\nhumour, if possible, until it was over. Mrs. Frederick did not reflect\nthat this was the first time in her life that she had thought it\nnecessary to consider Valancy’s humours. But then Valancy had never\nbeen “queer” before."

Drunk as usual but not in the roaring stage. Just\ndrunk enough to be excessively polite. He raised his disreputable old\ntartan cap with the air of a monarch saluting his subjects and swept\nthem a grand bow. Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles dared not cut\nRoaring Abel altogether. He was the only person in Deerwood who could\nbe got to do odd jobs of carpentering and repairing when they needed to\nbe done, so it would not do to offend him. But they responded with only\nthe stiffest, slightest of bows. Roaring Abel must be kept in his\nplace.Valancy, behind them, did a thing they were fortunately spared seeing.\nShe smiled gaily and waved her hand to Roaring Abel. Why not? She had\nalways liked the old sinner. He was such a jolly, picturesque,\nunashamed reprobate and stood out against the drab respectability of\nDeerwood and its customs like a flame-red flag of revolt and protest.\nOnly a few nights ago Abel had gone through Deerwood in the wee sma’s,\nshouting oaths at the top of his stentorian voice which could be heard\nfor miles, and lashing his horse into a furious gallop as he tore along\nprim, proper Elm Street.“Yelling and blaspheming like a fiend,” shuddered Cousin Stickles at\nthe breakfast-table.“I cannot understand why the judgment of the Lord has not fallen upon\nthat man long ere this,” said Mrs. Frederick petulantly, as if she\nthought Providence was very dilatory and ought to have a gentle\nreminder.“He’ll be picked up dead some morning—he’ll fall under his horse’s\nhoofs and be trampled to death,” said Cousin Stickles reassuringly.Valancy had said nothing, of course; but she wondered to herself if\nRoaring Abel’s periodical sprees were not his futile protest against\nthe poverty and drudgery and monotony of his existence. _She_ went on\ndream sprees in her Blue Castle. Roaring Abel, having no imagination,\ncould not do that. _His_ escapes from reality had to be concrete. So\nshe waved at him today with a sudden fellow feeling, and Roaring Abel,\nnot too drunk to be astonished, nearly fell off his seat in his\namazement.By this time they had reached Maple Avenue and Uncle Herbert’s house, a\nlarge, pretentious structure peppered with meaningless bay windows and\nexcrescent porches. A house that always looked like a stupid,\nprosperous, self-satisfied man with warts on his face.“A house like that,” said Valancy solemnly, “is a blasphemy.”"

She held Valancy back on the landing as\nCousin Stickles went downstairs.“Won’t you try to remember you’re a lady?” she pleaded.“Oh, if there were only any hope of being able to forget it!” said\nValancy wearily.Mrs. Frederick felt that she had not deserved this from Providence.CHAPTER X“Bless this food to our use and consecrate our lives to Thy service,”\nsaid Uncle Herbert briskly.Aunt Wellington frowned. She always considered Herbert’s graces\nentirely too short and “flippant.” A grace, to be a grace in Aunt\nWellington’s eyes, had to be at least three minutes long and uttered in\nan unearthly tone, between a groan and a chant. As a protest she kept\nher head bent a perceptible time after all the rest had been lifted.\nWhen she permitted herself to sit upright she found Valancy looking at\nher. Ever afterwards Aunt Wellington averred that she had known from\nthat moment that there was something wrong with Valancy. In those\nqueer, slanted eyes of hers—“we should always have known she was not\nentirely _right_ with eyes like that”—there was an odd gleam of mockery\nand amusement—as if Valancy were laughing at _her_. Such a thing was\nunthinkable, of course. Aunt Wellington at once ceased to think it.Valancy was enjoying herself. She had never enjoyed herself at a\n“family reunion” before. In social function, as in childish games, she\nhad only “filled in.” Her clan had always considered her very dull. She\nhad no parlour tricks. And she had been in the habit of taking refuge\nfrom the boredom of family parties in her Blue Castle, which resulted\nin an absent-mindedness that increased her reputation for dulness and\nvacuity."

Now she was no longer afraid of\nthem. The shackles had been stricken off her soul. She was quite\nprepared to talk if occasion offered. Meanwhile she was giving herself\nsuch freedom of thought as she had never dared to take before. She let\nherself go with a wild, inner exultation, as Uncle Herbert carved the\nturkey. Uncle Herbert gave Valancy a second look that day. Being a man,\nhe didn’t know what she had done to her hair, but he thought\nsurprisedly that Doss was not such a bad-looking girl, after all; and\nhe put an extra piece of white meat on her plate.“What herb is most injurious to a young lady’s beauty?” propounded\nUncle Benjamin by way of starting conversation—“loosening things up a\nbit,” as he would have said.Valancy, whose duty it was to say, “What?” did not say it. Nobody else\nsaid it, so Uncle Benjamin, after an expectant pause, had to answer,\n“Thyme,” and felt that his riddle had fallen flat. He looked\nresentfully at Valancy, who had never failed him before, but Valancy\ndid not seem even to be aware of him. She was gazing around the table,\nexamining relentlessly every one in this depressing assembly of\nsensible people and watching their little squirms with a detached,\namused smile.So these were the people she had always held in reverence and fear. She\nseemed to see them with new eyes.Big, capable, patronising, voluble Aunt Mildred, who thought herself\nthe cleverest woman in the clan, her husband a little lower than the\nangels and her children wonders. Had not her son, Howard, been all\nthrough teething at eleven months? And could she not tell you the best\nway to do everything, from cooking mushrooms to picking up a snake?\nWhat a bore she was! What ugly moles she had on her face!Cousin Gladys, who was always praising her son, who had died young, and\nalways fighting with her living one. She had neuritis—or what she\ncalled neuritis. It jumped about from one part of her body to another.\nIt was a convenient thing. If anybody wanted her to go somewhere she\ndidn’t want to go she had neuritis in her legs. And always if any\nmental effort was required she could have neuritis in her head. You\ncan’t _think_ with neuritis in your head, my dear.“What an old humbug you are!” thought Valancy impiously.Aunt Isabel. Valancy counted her chins. Aunt Isabel was the critic of\nthe clan. She had always gone about squashing people flat. More members\nof it than Valancy were afraid of her. She had, it was conceded, a\nbiting tongue.“I wonder what would happen to your face if you ever smiled,”\nspeculated Valancy, unblushingly."
