  "content": "Valancy wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding\ndawn. She had not slept very well. One does not sleep well, sometimes,\nwhen one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community\nand connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to\nget a man.Deerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless\nold maidenhood. But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished a\ncertain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way\nyet—never, until this wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the\nfact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man.Ay, _there_ lay the sting. Valancy did not mind so much being an old\nmaid. After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as\ndreadful as being married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin,\nor even an Uncle Herbert. What hurt her was that she had never had a\nchance to be anything but an old maid. No man had ever desired her.The tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly\ngreying darkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted\nto, for two reasons. She was afraid that crying might bring on another\nattack of that pain around the heart. She had had a spell of it after\nshe had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet. And she was\nafraid her mother would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at\nher with minute, persistent, mosquito-like questions regarding the\ncause thereof.“Suppose,” thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, “I answered with the\nplain truth, ‘I am crying because I cannot get married.’ How horrified\nMother would be—though she is ashamed every day of her life of her old\nmaid daughter.”But of course appearances should be kept up. “It is not,” Valancy could\nhear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, “it is not\n_maidenly_ to think about _men_.”"

  "content": "The thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a\nsense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. For that matter, there\nwere a good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. But her\nlaughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled,\nfutile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and\nwatching, with a sick distaste, the chill, merciless light creeping\ninto her ugly, sordid room.She knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it. The\nyellow-painted floor, with one hideous, “hooked” rug by the bed, with a\ngrotesque, “hooked” dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke;\nthe faded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and\ncrossed by cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the\nbrown-paper lambrequin with purple roses on it; the spotted old\nlooking-glass with the crack across it, propped up on the inadequate\ndressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made by her mother in her\nmythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst corner, which\nCousin Stickles had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the beaded\npincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair;\nthe faded old motto, “Gone but not forgotten,” worked in coloured yarns\nabout Great-grand-mother Stirling’s grim old face; the old photographs\nof ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below. There were\nonly two pictures that were not of relatives. One, an old chromo of a\npuppy sitting on a rainy doorstep. That picture always made Valancy\nunhappy. That forlorn little dog crouched on the doorstep in the\ndriving rain! Why didn’t _some one_ open the door and let him in? The\nother picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise\ncoming down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington had lavishly given her on\nher tenth birthday. For nineteen years she had looked at it and hated\nit, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. But she never dared\ndestroy it or remove it. Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been\naghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would\nhave had a fit."

  "content": "Every room in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances\nwere kept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw.\nValancy sometimes felt that she could have done something for her room\nherself, even without money, if she were permitted. But her mother had\nnegatived every timid suggestion and Valancy did not persist. Valancy\nnever persisted. She was afraid to. Her mother could not brook\nopposition. Mrs. Stirling would sulk for days if offended, with the\nairs of an insulted duchess.The only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone\nthere at night to cry if she wanted to.But, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for\nnothing except sleeping and dressing in, were ugly? Valancy was never\npermitted to stay alone in her room for any other purpose. People who\nwanted to be alone, so Mrs. Frederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles\nbelieved, could only want to be alone for some sinister purpose. But\nher room in the Blue Castle was everything a room should be.Valancy, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life,\nwas wont to let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams. Nobody\nin the Stirling clan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of\nall her mother and Cousin Stickles. They never knew that Valancy had\ntwo homes—the ugly red brick box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue\nCastle in Spain. Valancy had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever\nsince she could remember. She had been a very tiny child when she found\nherself possessed of it. Always, when she shut her eyes, she could see\nit plainly, with its turrets and banners on the pine-clad mountain\nheight, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the sunset skies\nof a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was in\nthat castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and\nfire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps,\nwith great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up\nand down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell\nand nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that\nreflected only handsome knights and lovely women—herself the loveliest\nof all, for whose glance men died. All that supported her through the\nboredom of her days was the hope of going on a dream spree at night.\nMost, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they\nhad known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle."

  "content": "For one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time.\nOne who wooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry\nand won her after long devotion and many deeds of derring-do, and was\nwedded to her with pomp and circumstance in the great, banner-hung\nchapel of the Blue Castle.At twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly\nblue eyes. At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still\nnecessarily handsome. At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At\ntwenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, slightly grim, and a face strong\nand rugged rather than handsome. Valancy never grew older than\ntwenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently—very recently—her hero had\nhad reddish, tawny hair, a twisted smile and a mysterious past.I don’t say Valancy deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew\nthem. One simply faded away as another came. Things are very convenient\nin this respect in Blue Castles.But, on this morning of her day of fate, Valancy could not find the key\nof her Blue Castle. Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking at her\nheels like a maddening little dog. She was twenty-nine, lonely,\nundesired, ill-favoured—the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with\nno past and no future. As far as she could look back, life was drab and\ncolourless, with not one single crimson or purple spot anywhere. As far\nas she could look forward it seemed certain to be just the same until\nshe was nothing but a solitary, little withered leaf clinging to a\nwintry bough. The moment when a woman realises that she has nothing to\nlive for—neither love, duty, purpose nor hope—holds for her the\nbitterness of death.“And I just have to go on living because I can’t stop. I may have to\nlive eighty years,” thought Valancy, in a kind of panic. “We’re all\nhorribly long-lived. It sickens me to think of it.”"

  "content": "She was glad it was raining—or rather, she was drearily satisfied that\nit was raining. There would be no picnic that day. This annual picnic,\nwhereby Aunt and Uncle Wellington—one always thought of them in that\nsuccession—inevitably celebrated their engagement at a picnic thirty\nyears before, had been, of late years, a veritable nightmare to\nValancy. By an impish coincidence it was the same day as her birthday\nand, after she had passed twenty-five, nobody let her forget it.Much as she hated going to the picnic, it would never have occurred to\nher to rebel against it. There seemed to be nothing of the\nrevolutionary in her nature. And she knew exactly what every one would\nsay to her at the picnic. Uncle Wellington, whom she disliked and\ndespised even though he had fulfilled the highest Stirling aspiration,\n“marrying money,” would say to her in a pig’s whisper, “Not thinking of\ngetting married yet, my dear?” and then go off into the bellow of\nlaughter with which he invariably concluded his dull remarks. Aunt\nWellington, of whom Valancy stood in abject awe, would tell her about\nOlive’s new chiffon dress and Cecil’s last devoted letter. Valancy\nwould have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter\nhad been hers or else Aunt Wellington would be offended. And Valancy\nhad long ago decided that she would rather offend God than Aunt\nWellington, because God might forgive her but Aunt Wellington never\nwould.Aunt Alberta, enormously fat, with an amiable habit of always referring\nto her husband as “he,” as if he were the only male creature in the\nworld, who could never forget that she had been a great beauty in her\nyouth, would condole with Valancy on her sallow skin—“I don’t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned. When _I_ was\na girl my skin was roses and cream. I was counted the prettiest girl in\nCanada, my dear.”Perhaps Uncle Herbert wouldn’t say anything—or perhaps he would remark\njocularly, “How fat you’re getting, Doss!” And then everybody would\nlaugh over the excessively humorous idea of poor, scrawny little Doss\ngetting fat.Handsome, solemn Uncle James, whom Valancy disliked but respected\nbecause he was reputed to be very clever and was therefore the clan\noracle—brains being none too plentiful in the Stirling connection—would\nprobably remark with the owl-like sarcasm that had won him his\nreputation, “I suppose you’re busy with your hope-chest these days?”"

  "content": "And Uncle Benjamin would ask some of his abominable conundrums, between\nwheezy chuckles, and answer them himself.“What is the difference between Doss and a mouse?“The mouse wishes to harm the cheese and Doss wishes to charm the\nhe’s.”Valancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she\nwanted to throw something at him. But she never did. In the first\nplace, the Stirlings simply did not throw things; in the second place,\nUncle Benjamin was a wealthy and childless old widower and Valancy had\nbeen brought up in the fear and admonition of his money. If she\noffended him he would cut her out of his will—supposing she were in it.\nValancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin’s will. She had\nbeen poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it. So she\nendured his riddles and even smiled tortured little smiles over them.Aunt Isabel, downright and disagreeable as an east wind, would\ncriticise her in some way—Valancy could not predict just how, for Aunt\nIsabel never repeated a criticism—she found something new with which to\njab you every time. Aunt Isabel prided herself on saying what she\nthought, but didn’t like it so well when other people said what _they_\nthought to _her_. Valancy never said what _she_ thought.Cousin Georgiana—named after her great-great-grand-mother, who had been\nnamed after George the Fourth—would recount dolorously the names of all\nrelatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder\n“which of us will be the first to go next.”"

  "content": "Oppressively competent, Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly of her\nhusband and her odious prodigies of babies to Valancy, because Valancy\nwould be the only one she could find to put up with it. For the same\nreason, Cousin Gladys—really First Cousin Gladys once removed,\naccording to the strict way in which the Stirlings tabulated\nrelationship—a tall, thin lady who admitted she had a sensitive\ndisposition, would describe minutely the tortures of her neuritis. And\nOlive, the wonder girl of the whole Stirling clan, who had everything\nValancy had not—beauty, popularity, love,—would show off her beauty and\npresume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia of love in\nValancy’s dazzled, envious eyes.There would be none of all this today. And there would be no packing up\nof teaspoons. The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin\nStickles. And once, six years ago, a silver teaspoon from Aunt\nWellington’s wedding set had been lost. Valancy never heard the last of\nthat silver teaspoon. Its ghost appeared Banquo-like at every\nsubsequent family feast.Oh, yes, Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she\nblessed the rain that had saved her from it. There would be no picnic\nthis year. If Aunt Wellington could not celebrate on the sacred day\nitself she would have no celebration at all. Thank whatever gods there\nwere for that.Since there would be no picnic, Valancy made up her mind that, if the\nrain held up in the afternoon, she would go up to the library and get\nanother of John Foster’s books. Valancy was never allowed to read\nnovels, but John Foster’s books were not novels. They were “nature\nbooks”—so the librarian told Mrs. Frederick Stirling—“all about the\nwoods and birds and bugs and things like that, you know.” So Valancy\nwas allowed to read them—under protest, for it was only too evident\nthat she enjoyed them too much. It was permissible, even laudable, to\nread to improve your mind and your religion, but a book that was\nenjoyable was dangerous. Valancy did not know whether her mind was\nbeing improved or not; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across\nJohn Foster’s books years ago life might have been a different thing\nfor her. They seemed to her to yield glimpses of a world into which she\nmight once have entered, though the door was forever barred to her now.\nIt was only within the last year that John Foster’s books had been in\nthe Deerwood library, though the librarian told Valancy that he had\nbeen a well-known writer for several years.“Where does he live?” Valancy had asked."

  "content": "“Nobody knows. From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more\ninformation can be had. His publishers won’t say a word. Quite likely\nJohn Foster is a nom de plume. His books are so popular we can’t keep\nthem in at all, though I really can’t see what people find in them to\nrave over.”“I think they’re wonderful,” said Valancy, timidly.“Oh—well—” Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising fashion that relegated\nValancy’s opinions to limbo, “I can’t say I care much for bugs myself.\nBut certainly Foster seems to know all there is to know about them.”Valancy didn’t know whether she cared much for bugs either. It was not\nJohn Foster’s uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that\nenthralled her. She could hardly say what it was—some tantalising lure\nof a mystery never revealed—some hint of a great secret just a little\nfurther on—some faint, elusive echo of lovely, forgotten things—John\nFoster’s magic was indefinable.Yes, she would get a new Foster book. It was a month since she had\n_Thistle Harvest_, so surely Mother could not object. Valancy had read\nit four times—she knew whole passages off by heart.And—she almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer\npain around the heart. It had come rather often lately, and the\npalpitations were becoming annoying, not to speak of an occasional\ndizzy moment and a queer shortness of breath. But could she go to see\nhim without telling any one? It was a most daring thought. None of the\nStirlings ever consulted a doctor without holding a family council and\ngetting Uncle James’ approval. _Then_, they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh\nof Port Lawrence, who had married Second Cousin Adelaide Stirling.But Valancy disliked Dr. Ambrose Marsh. And, besides, she could not get\nto Port Lawrence, fifteen miles away, without being taken there. She\ndid not want any one to know about her heart. There would be such a\nfuss made and every member of the family would come down and talk it\nover and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible\ntales of great-aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been “just\nlike that” and “dropped dead without a moment’s warning, my dear.”"

She felt\nquite sure there was nothing at all seriously wrong with her heart and\nno need of all the pother that would ensue if she mentioned it. She\nwould just slip up quietly and see Dr. Trent that very day. As for his\nbill, she had the two hundred dollars that her father had put in the\nbank for her the day she was born. She was never allowed to use even\nthe interest of this, but she would secretly take out enough to pay Dr.\nTrent.Dr. Trent was a gruff, outspoken, absent-minded old fellow, but he was\na recognised authority on heart disease, even if he were only a general\npractitioner in out-of-the-world Deerwood. Dr. Trent was over seventy\nand there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon. None of the\nStirling clan had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, ten\nyears before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed\nit. You couldn’t patronise a doctor who insulted your\nfirst-cousin-once-removed like that—not to mention that he was a\nPresbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican church. But\nValancy, between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea of\nfuss and clatter and advice, thought she would take a chance with the\ndevil.CHAPTER II"

  "content": "When Cousin Stickles knocked at her door, Valancy knew it was half-past\nseven and she must get up. As long as she could remember, Cousin\nStickles had knocked at her door at half-past seven. Cousin Stickles\nand Mrs. Frederick Stirling had been up since seven, but Valancy was\nallowed to lie abed half an hour longer because of a family tradition\nthat she was delicate. Valancy got up, though she hated getting up more\nthis morning than ever she had before. What was there to get up for?\nAnother dreary day like all the days that had preceded it, full of\nmeaningless little tasks, joyless and unimportant, that benefited\nnobody. But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready for\nbreakfast at eight o’clock. Hard and fast times for meals were the rule\nin Mrs. Stirling’s household. Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, supper\nat six, year in and year out. No excuses for being late were ever\ntolerated. So up Valancy got, shivering.The room was bitterly cold with the raw, penetrating chill of a wet May\nmorning. The house would be cold all day. It was one of Mrs.\nFrederick’s rules that no fires were necessary after the twenty-fourth\nof May. Meals were cooked on the little oil-stove in the back porch.\nAnd though May might be icy and October frost-bitten, no fires were\nlighted until the twenty-first of October by the calendar. On the\ntwenty-first of October Mrs. Frederick began cooking over the kitchen\nrange and lighted a fire in the sitting-room stove in the evenings. It\nwas whispered about in the connection that the late Frederick Stirling\nhad caught the cold which resulted in his death during Valancy’s first\nyear of life because Mrs. Frederick would not have a fire on the\ntwentieth of October. She lighted it the next day—but that was a day\ntoo late for Frederick Stirling.Valancy took off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse,\nunbleached cotton, with high neck and long, tight sleeves. She put on\nundergarments of a similar nature, a dress of brown gingham, thick,\nblack stockings and rubber-heeled boots. Of late years she had fallen\ninto the habit of doing her hair with the shade of the window by the\nlooking-glass pulled down. The lines on her face did not show so\nplainly then. But this morning she jerked the shade to the very top and\nlooked at herself in the leprous mirror with a passionate determination\nto see herself as the world saw her."

  "content": "The result was rather dreadful. Even a beauty would have found that\nharsh, unsoftened side-light trying. Valancy saw straight black hair,\nshort and thin, always lustreless despite the fact that she gave it one\nhundred strokes of the brush, neither more nor less, every night of her\nlife and faithfully rubbed Redfern’s Hair Vigor into the roots, more\nlustreless than ever in its morning roughness; fine, straight, black\nbrows; a nose she had always felt was much too small even for her\nsmall, three-cornered, white face; a small, pale mouth that always fell\nopen a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; a figure thin and\nflat-breasted, rather below the average height. She had somehow escaped\nthe family high cheek-bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and\nshadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. Apart from\nher eyes she was neither pretty nor ugly—just insignificant-looking,\nshe concluded bitterly. How plain the lines around her eyes and mouth\nwere in that merciless light! And never had her narrow, white face\nlooked so narrow and so white.She did her hair in a pompadour. Pompadours had long gone out of\nfashion, but they had been in when Valancy first put her hair up and\nAunt Wellington had decided that she must always wear her hair so.“It is the _only_ way that becomes you. Your face is so small that you\n_must_ add height to it by a pompadour effect,” said Aunt Wellington,\nwho always enunciated commonplaces as if uttering profound and\nimportant truths.Valancy had hankered to do her hair pulled low on her forehead, with\npuffs above the ears, as Olive was wearing hers. But Aunt Wellington’s\ndictum had such an effect on her that she never dared change her style\nof hairdressing again. But then, there were so many things Valancy\nnever dared do.All her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly.\nFrom the very dawn of recollection, when she had been so horribly\nafraid of the big black bear that lived, so Cousin Stickles told her,\nin the closet under the stairs.“And I always will be—I know it—I can’t help it. I don’t know what it\nwould be like not to be afraid of something.”Afraid of her mother’s sulky fits—afraid of offending Uncle\nBenjamin—afraid of becoming a target for Aunt Wellington’s\ncontempt—afraid of Aunt Isabel’s biting comments—afraid of Uncle James’\ndisapproval—afraid of offending the whole clan’s opinions and\nprejudices—afraid of not keeping up appearances—afraid to say what she\nreally thought of  anything—afraid of poverty in her old age.\nFear—fear—fear—she could never escape from it. It bound her and\nenmeshed her like a spider’s web of steel. Only in her Blue Castle\ncould she find temporary release. And this morning Valancy could not\nbelieve she had a Blue Castle. She would never be able to find it\nagain. Twenty-nine, unmarried, undesired—what had she to do with the\nfairy-like chatelaine of the Blue Castle? She would cut such childish\nnonsense out of her life forever and face reality unflinchingly."

The ugliness of\nthe view always struck her like a blow; the ragged fence, the\ntumble-down old carriage-shop in the next lot, plastered with crude,\nviolently coloured advertisements; the grimy railway station beyond,\nwith the awful derelicts that were always hanging around it even at\nthis early hour. In the pouring rain everything looked worse than\nusual, especially the beastly advertisement, “Keep that schoolgirl\ncomplexion.” Valancy _had_ kept her schoolgirl complexion. That was\njust the trouble. There was not a gleam of beauty anywhere—“exactly\nlike my life,” thought Valancy drearily. Her brief bitterness had\npassed. She accepted facts as resignedly as she had always accepted\nthem. She was one of the people whom life always passes by. There was\nno altering that fact.In this mood Valancy went down to breakfast.CHAPTER IIIBreakfast was always the same.

Mrs. Frederick thought\ntwo teaspoonfuls extravagant—but that did not matter to Valancy, who\nhated marmalade, too. The chilly, gloomy little dining-room was\nchillier and gloomier than usual; the rain streamed down outside the\nwindow; departed Stirlings, in atrocious, gilt frames, wider than the\npictures, glowered down from the walls. And yet Cousin Stickles wished\nValancy many happy returns of the day!“Sit up straight, Doss,” was all her mother said.Valancy sat up straight. She talked to her mother and Cousin Stickles\nof the things they always talked of. She never wondered what would\nhappen if she tried to talk of something else. She knew. Therefore she\nnever did it.Mrs. Frederick was offended with Providence for sending a rainy day\nwhen she wanted to go to a picnic, so she ate her breakfast in a sulky\nsilence for which Valancy was rather grateful. But Christine Stickles\nwhined endlessly on as usual, complaining about everything—the weather,\nthe leak in the pantry, the price of oatmeal and butter—Valancy felt at\nonce she had buttered her toast too lavishly—the epidemic of mumps in\nDeerwood.“Doss will be sure to ketch them,” she foreboded.“Doss must not go where she is likely to catch mumps,” said Mrs.\nFrederick shortly.Valancy had never had mumps—or whooping cough—or chicken-pox—or\nmeasles—or anything she should have had—nothing but horrible colds\nevery winter. Doss’ winter colds were a sort of tradition in the\nfamily. Nothing, it seemed, could prevent her from catching them. Mrs.\nFrederick and Cousin Stickles did their heroic best. One winter they\nkept Valancy housed up from November to May, in the warm sitting-room.\nShe was not even allowed to go to church. And Valancy took cold after\ncold and ended up with bronchitis in June."

  "content": "“None of _my_ family were ever like that,” said Mrs. Frederick,\nimplying that it must be a Stirling tendency.“The Stirlings seldom take colds,” said Cousin Stickles resentfully.\n_She_ had been a Stirling.“I think,” said Mrs. Frederick, “that if a person makes up her mind\n_not_ to have colds she will not _have_ colds.”So that was the trouble. It was all Valancy’s own fault.But on this particular morning Valancy’s unbearable grievance was that\nshe was called Doss. She had endured it for twenty-nine years, and all\nat once she felt she could not endure it any longer. Her full name was\nValancy Jane. Valancy Jane was rather terrible, but she liked Valancy,\nwith its odd, out-land tang. It was always a wonder to Valancy that the\nStirlings had allowed her to be so christened. She had been told that\nher maternal grandfather, old Amos Wansbarra, had chosen the name for\nher. Her father had tacked on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the\nwhole connection got out of the difficulty by nicknaming her Doss. She\nnever got Valancy from any one but outsiders.“Mother,” she said timidly, “would you mind calling me Valancy after\nthis? Doss seems so—so—I don’t like it.”Mrs. Frederick looked at her daughter in astonishment. She wore glasses\nwith enormously strong lenses that gave her eyes a peculiarly\ndisagreeable appearance.“What is the matter with Doss?”“It—seems so childish,” faltered Valancy.“Oh!” Mrs. Frederick had been a Wansbarra and the Wansbarra smile was\nnot an asset. “I see. Well, it should suit _you_ then. You are childish\nenough in all conscience, my dear child.”“I am twenty-nine,” said the dear child desperately.“I wouldn’t proclaim it from the house-tops if I were you, dear,” said\nMrs. Frederick. “Twenty-nine! _I_ had been married nine years when I\nwas twenty-nine.”“_I_ was married at seventeen,” said Cousin Stickles proudly."

Mrs. Frederick, except for those\nterrible glasses and the hooked nose that made her look more like a\nparrot than a parrot itself could look, was not ill-looking. At twenty\nshe might have been quite pretty. But Cousin Stickles! And yet\nChristine Stickles had once been desirable in some man’s eyes. Valancy\nfelt that Cousin Stickles, with her broad, flat, wrinkled face, a mole\nright on the end of her dumpy nose, bristling hairs on her chin,\nwrinkled yellow neck, pale, protruding eyes, and thin, puckered mouth,\nhad yet this advantage over her—this right to look down on her. And\neven yet Cousin Stickles was necessary to Mrs. Frederick. Valancy\nwondered pitifully what it would be like to be wanted by some\none—needed by some one. No one in the whole world needed her, or would\nmiss anything from life if she dropped suddenly out of it. She was a\ndisappointment to her mother. No one loved her. She had never so much\nas had a girl friend.“I haven’t even a gift for friendship,” she had once admitted to\nherself pitifully.“Doss, you haven’t eaten your crusts,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.It rained all the forenoon without cessation. Valancy pieced a quilt.\nValancy hated piecing quilts. And there was no need of it. The house\nwas full of quilts. There were three big chests, packed with quilts, in\nthe attic. Mrs. Frederick had begun storing away quilts when Valancy\nwas seventeen and she kept on storing them, though it did not seem\nlikely that Valancy would ever need them. But Valancy must be at work\nand fancy work materials were too expensive. Idleness was a cardinal\nsin in the Stirling household. When Valancy had been a child she had\nbeen made to write down every night, in a small, hated, black notebook,\nall the minutes she had spent in idleness that day. On Sundays her\nmother made her tot them up and pray over them.On this particular forenoon of this day of destiny Valancy spent only\nten minutes in idleness. At least, Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles\nwould have called it idleness. She went to her room to get a better\nthimble and she opened _Thistle Harvest_ guiltily at random."

An occasional saunter through them, keeping to the\nwell-trodden paths, will never admit us to their intimacy. If we wish\nto be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent, reverent\nvisits at all hours; by morning, by noon, and by night; and at all\nseasons, in spring, in summer, in autumn, in winter. Otherwise we can\nnever really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary\nwill never impose on them. They have their own effective way of keeping\naliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual\nsightseers. It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except\nsheer love of them; they will find us out at once and hide all their\nsweet, old-world secrets from us. But if they know we come to them\nbecause we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such\ntreasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any\nmarket-place. For the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly\nand hold nothing back from their true worshippers. We must go to them\nlovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what\npoignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervals,\nlying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music are\nharped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate\nsavours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp\nbrooklands, what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt\nthem. Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and\nits subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever,\nso that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be\ndrawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship.”“Doss,” called her mother from the hall below, “what are you doing all\nby yourself in that room?”Valancy dropped _Thistle Harvest_ like a hot coal and fled downstairs\nto her patches; but she felt the strange exhilaration of spirit that\nalways came momentarily to her when she dipped into one of John\nFoster’s books. Valancy did not know much about woods—except the\nhaunted groves of oak and pine around her Blue Castle. But she had\nalways secretly hankered after them and a Foster book about woods was\nthe next best thing to the woods themselves.At noon it stopped raining, but the sun did not come out until three.\nThen Valancy timidly said she thought she would go uptown.“What do you want to go uptown for?” demanded her mother.“I want to get a book from the library.”“You got a book from the library only last week.”“No, it was four weeks.”“Four weeks. Nonsense!”“Really it was, Mother.”“You are mistaken. It cannot possibly have been more than two weeks. I\ndislike contradiction. And I do not see what you want to get a book\nfor, anyhow. You waste too much time reading.”“Of what value is my time?” asked Valancy bitterly.“Doss! Don’t speak in that tone to _me_.”“We need some tea,” said Cousin Stickles. “She might go and get that if\nshe wants a walk—though this damp weather is bad for colds.”They argued the matter for ten minutes longer and finally Mrs.\nFrederick agreed rather grudgingly that Valancy might go.CHAPTER IV“Got your rubbers on?” called Cousin Stickles, as Valancy left the\nhouse.Christine Stickles had never once forgotten to ask that question when\nValancy went out on a damp day.“Yes.”“Have you got your flannel petticoat on?” asked Mrs. Frederick.“No.”“Doss, I really do not understand you. Do you want to catch your death\nof cold _again_?” Her voice implied that Valancy had died of a cold\nseveral times already. “Go upstairs this minute and put it on!”“Mother, I don’t _need_ a flannel petticoat. My sateen one is warm\nenough.”"

Go and do as you are\ntold!”Valancy went, though nobody will ever know just how near she came to\nhurling the rubber-plant into the street before she went. She hated\nthat grey flannel petticoat more than any other garment she owned.\nOlive never had to wear flannel petticoats. Olive wore ruffled silk and\nsheer lawn and filmy laced flounces. But Olive’s father had “married\nmoney” and Olive never had bronchitis. So there you were.“Are you sure you didn’t leave the soap in the water?” demanded Mrs.\nFrederick. But Valancy was gone. She turned at the corner and looked\nback down the ugly, prim, respectable street where she lived. The\nStirling house was the ugliest on it—more like a red brick box than\nanything else. Too high for its breadth, and made still higher by a\nbulbous glass cupola on top. About it was the desolate, barren peace of\nan old house whose life is lived.There was a very pretty little house, with leaded casements and dubbed\ngables, just around the corner—a new house, one of those houses you\nlove the minute you see them. Clayton Markley had built it for his\nbride. He was to be married to Jennie Lloyd in June. The little house,\nit was said, was furnished from attic to cellar, in complete readiness\nfor its mistress.“I don’t envy Jennie the man,” thought Valancy sincerely—Clayton\nMarkley was not one of her many ideals—“but I _do_ envy her the house.\nIt’s such a nice young house. Oh, if I could only have a house of my\nown—ever so poor, so tiny—but my own! But then,” she added bitterly,\n“there is no use in yowling for the moon when you can’t even get a\ntallow candle.”"

She envied Jennie Lloyd more fiercely than ever today. Jennie\nwas not so much better looking than she was, and not so very much\nyounger. Yet she was to have this delightful house. And the nicest\nlittle Wedgwood teacups—Valancy had seen them; an open fireplace, and\nmonogrammed linen; hemstitched tablecloths, and china-closets. Why did\n_everything_ come to some girls and _nothing_ to others? It wasn’t\nfair.Valancy was once more seething with rebellion as she walked along, a\nprim, dowdy little figure in her shabby raincoat and three-year-old\nhat, splashed occasionally by the mud of a passing motor with its\ninsulting shrieks. Motors were still rather a novelty in Deerwood,\nthough they were common in Port Lawrence, and most of the summer\nresidents up at Muskoka had them. In Deerwood only some of the smart\nset had them; for even Deerwood was divided into sets. There was the\nsmart set—the intellectual set—the old-family set—of which the\nStirlings were members—the common run, and a few pariahs. Not one of\nthe Stirling clan had as yet condescended to a motor, though Olive was\nteasing her father to have one. Valancy had never even been in a\nmotorcar. But she did not hanker after this. In truth, she felt rather\nafraid of motorcars, especially at night. They seemed to be too much\nlike big purring beasts that might turn and crush you—or make some\nterrible savage leap somewhere. On the steep mountain trails around her\nBlue Castle only gaily caparisoned steeds might proudly pace; in real\nlife Valancy would have been quite contented to drive in a buggy behind\na nice horse. She got a buggy drive only when some uncle or cousin\nremembered to fling her “a chance,” like a bone to a dog.CHAPTER VOf course she must buy the tea in Uncle Benjamin’s grocery-store. To\nbuy it anywhere else was unthinkable. Yet Valancy hated to go to Uncle\nBenjamin’s store on her twenty-ninth birthday. There was no hope that\nhe would not remember it.“Why,” demanded Uncle Benjamin, leeringly, as he tied up her tea, “are\nyoung ladies like bad grammarians?”Valancy, with Uncle Benjamin’s will in the background of her mind, said\nmeekly, “I don’t know. Why?”“Because,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin, “they can’t decline matrimony.”"

On the first day Claude\nBertram had seen her in the store she had heard him whisper to Joe,\n“Who is that?” And Joe had said, “Valancy Stirling—one of the Deerwood\nold maids.” “Curable or incurable?” Claude had asked with a snicker,\nevidently thinking the question very clever. Valancy smarted anew with\nthe sting of that old recollection.“Twenty-nine,” Uncle Benjamin was saying. “Dear me, Doss, you’re\ndangerously near the second corner and not even thinking of getting\nmarried yet. Twenty-nine. It seems impossible.”Then Uncle Benjamin said an original thing. Uncle Benjamin said, “How\ntime does fly!”“_I_ think it _crawls_,” said Valancy passionately. Passion was so\nalien to Uncle Benjamin’s conception of Valancy that he didn’t know\nwhat to make of her. To cover his confusion, he asked another conundrum\nas he tied up her beans—Cousin Stickles had remembered at the last\nmoment that they must have beans. Beans were cheap and filling.“What two ages are apt to prove illusory?” asked Uncle Benjamin; and,\nnot waiting for Valancy to “give it up,” he added, “Mir-age and\nmarriage.”“M-i-r-a-g-e is pronounced _mirazh_,” said Valancy shortly, picking up\nher tea and her beans. For the moment she did not care whether Uncle\nBenjamin cut her out of his will or not. She walked out of the store\nwhile Uncle Benjamin stared after her with his mouth open. Then he\nshook his head.“Poor Doss is taking it hard,” he said.Valancy was sorry by the time she reached the next crossing. Why had\nshe lost her patience like that? Uncle Benjamin would be annoyed and\nwould likely tell her mother that Doss had been impertinent—“to\n_me_!”—and her mother would lecture her for a week.“I’ve held my tongue for twenty years,” thought Valancy. “Why couldn’t\nI have held it once more?”Yes, it was just twenty, Valancy reflected, since she had first been\ntwitted with her loverless condition. She remembered the bitter moment\nperfectly. She was just nine years old and she was standing alone on\nthe school playground while the other little girls of her class were\nplaying a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner\nbefore you could play. Nobody had chosen Valancy—little, pale,\nblack-haired Valancy, with her prim, long-sleeved apron and odd,\nslanted eyes.“Oh,” said a pretty little girl to her, “I’m so sorry for you. You\nhaven’t got a beau.”"

I _do_ want to\nbe married. I want a house of my own—I want a husband of my own—I want\nsweet, little fat _babies_ of my own—” Valancy stopped suddenly aghast\nat her own recklessness. She felt sure that Rev. Dr. Stalling, who\npassed her at this moment, read her thoughts and disapproved of them\nthoroughly. Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling—had been afraid of him\never since the Sunday, twenty-three years before, when he had first\ncome to St. Albans’. Valancy had been too late for Sunday School that\nday and she had gone into the church timidly and sat in their pew. No\none else was in the church—nobody except the new rector, Dr. Stalling.\nDr. Stalling stood up in front of the choir door, beckoned to her, and\nsaid sternly, “Little boy, come up here.”Valancy had stared around her. There was no little boy—there was no one\nin all the huge church but herself. This strange man with the blue\nglasses couldn’t mean her. She was not a boy.“Little boy,” repeated Dr. Stalling, more sternly still, shaking his\nforefinger fiercely at her, “come up here at once!”Valancy arose as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle. She was too\nterrified to do anything else. What dreadful thing was going to happen\nto her? What _had_ happened to her? Had she actually turned into a boy?\nShe came to a stop in front of Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling shook his\nforefinger—such a long, knuckly forefinger—at her and said:“Little boy, take off your hat.”Valancy took off her hat. She had a scrawny little pigtail hanging down\nher back, but Dr. Stalling was short-sighted and did not perceive it.“Little boy, go back to your seat and _always_ take off your hat in\nchurch. _Remember_!”Valancy went back to her seat carrying her hat like an automaton.\nPresently her mother came in.“Doss,” said Mrs. Stirling, “what do you mean by taking off your hat?\nPut it on instantly!”"

Nobody knew why—Mrs. Frederick again\nbemoaned herself of her delicate child.Dr. Stalling found out his mistake and laughed over it to Valancy—who\ndid not laugh. She never got over her dread of Dr. Stalling. And now to\nbe caught by him on the street corner, thinking such things!Valancy got her John Foster book—_Magic of Wings_. “His latest—all\nabout birds,” said Miss Clarkson. She had almost decided that she would\ngo home, instead of going to see Dr. Trent. Her courage had failed her.\nShe was afraid of offending Uncle James—afraid of angering her\nmother—afraid of facing gruff, shaggy-browed old Dr. Trent, who would\nprobably tell her, as he had told Cousin Gladys, that her trouble was\nentirely imaginary and that she only had it because she liked to have\nit. No, she would not go; she would get a bottle of Redfern’s Purple\nPills instead. Redfern’s Purple Pills were the standard medicine of the\nStirling clan.

Valancy always felt very sceptical concerning\nthe virtues of the Purple Pills; but there _might_ be something in\nthem; and it was easier to take them than to face Dr. Trent alone. She\nwould glance over the magazines in the reading-room a few minutes and\nthen go home.Valancy tried to read a story, but it made her furious. On every page\nwas a picture of the heroine surrounded by adoring men. And here was\nshe, Valancy Stirling, who could not get a solitary beau! Valancy\nslammed the magazine shut; she opened _Magic of Wings_. Her eyes fell\non the paragraph that changed her life.“_Fear is the original sin_,” wrote John Foster. “_Almost all the evil\nin the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of\nsomething_.
