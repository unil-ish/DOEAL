Ever\nsince the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\ntumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the\nwhole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly\nspeak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\nwhat the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced\nto his pinioned foe.“‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.“‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing\nno more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that\nmight have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were\nturned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps\nclanged as before."

  "content": "“Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\nwas heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\nbesieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\nEntreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\ninstance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no\nsign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\nthat mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\nship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\nspeediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,\nnot to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\nspite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\nfor a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\nberth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\nvital jaw of the whale.“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\nall was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\nman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney\nthe chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\nthan half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he\ninsisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the\nhead of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\ncircumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\nthe boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In\nthis attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\nthis was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\nnext trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning\nof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\nin his watches below.“‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.“‘What do you think? what does it look like?’“‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’“‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length\nbefore him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough\ntwine,—have you any?’“But there was none in the forecastle.“‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.“‘You don’t mean to go a begging to _him!_’ said a sailor."

Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help\nhimself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him\nquietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\nhim—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an\niron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\nLakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock\nfor a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\nhelm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\ndug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the\nfore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and\nstretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.“But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\ndeed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\navenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\nto take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\ndone.“It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\nday, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe\nman, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There\nshe rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.“‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do\nwhales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’“‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but\nthat would be too long a story.’“‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.“‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more\ninto the air, Sirs.’“‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks\nfaint;—fill up his empty glass!’"

All was now a phrensy.\n‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and\nharpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to\ncapture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed\naskance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,\nthat lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a\nliving opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality\npervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out\nbefore the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of\nthe mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\nwhile Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or\nslacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\nwere lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely\nwith delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\nstiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\nsprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.\nAnd now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.\nNothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\nfoam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat\nstruck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the\nstanding mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,\nthe boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was\ntossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\nout through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\nveil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But\nthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\nbetween his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,\nand went down."

But a sudden, terrific,\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\ncut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose\nagain, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the\nteeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the\nwhale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary\nplace—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\namong the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\nwar-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\nupon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\ndown the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over\ntheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both\nby night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,\nthat upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a\nweakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so\nheavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the\nship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon\nfrom the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\nIslanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with\nhim, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\nbefore the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\nreinforcement to his crew."

He steered away from\nit; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of\nSteelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The\ncaptain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked\nwar-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the\npistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and\nfoam.“‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.“‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;\n‘no lies.’“‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he\nleaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,\nstood face to face with the captain.“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As\nsoon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder\nisland, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike\nme!’“‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping\ninto the sea, he swam back to his comrades.“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\nroots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\ntime arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck\nbefriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were\nprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor\nheaded. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former\ncaptain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.“Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,\nand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized\nTahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small\nnative schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all\nright there, again resumed his cruisings.“Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\nNantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to\ngive up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\ndestroyed him.  * * * *“‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.“‘I am, Don.’“‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,\nthis your story is in substance really true?

Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\nsomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\neye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\nalongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\nIt may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious\nimaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\nconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman.

For\never since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\npanellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\nmedallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\nchain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever\nsince then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\nonly in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\npresentations of him.Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\nto be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\nElephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless\nsculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,\nevery conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of\nthem actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our\nnoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The\nHindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\ndepicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly\nknown as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small\nsection of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an\nanaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes."

It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing\nAndromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model\nof such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the\nsame scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better.\nThe huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the\nsurface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on\nits back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\nrolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames\nby water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old\nScotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depicted in the prints of old\nBibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for\nthe book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a\ndescending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of\nmany books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely\nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on\nantique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless\ncall this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\nintended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an\nold Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\nRevival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\ncomparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\nspecies of the Leviathan.In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\nwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\nmanner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\nBaden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the\ntitle-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you\nwill find some curious whales.But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\npictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\nby those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some\nplates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\nentitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\nWhale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the\nwhales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among\nice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another\nplate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\nperpendicular flukes.Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\nColnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round\nCape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\nSpermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to\nbe a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from\none killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”\nI doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\nbenefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say\nthat it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,\nto a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a\nbow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not\ngive us Jonah looking out of that eye!"

Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In\nthe abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\n“whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this\nunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the\nnarwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\nany intelligent public of schoolboys.Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great\nnaturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\nseveral pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\nare not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\nwhale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\nexperienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\ncounterpart in nature.But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\nreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\nBaron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\ngives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\npicture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\nretreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is\nnot a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\na whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\npicture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\nin the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\nis, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the\npencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.As for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the\nshops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\nRichard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\nbreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of\nmariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\npaint."

  "content": "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\nsurprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have\nbeen taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\ndrawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\nthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\nThough elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living\nLeviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The\nliving whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen\nat sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out\nof sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element\nit is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily\ninto the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.\nAnd, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour\nbetween a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;\nyet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a\nship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying\nshape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not\ncatch.But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\nwhale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at\nall. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\nthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though\nJeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of\none of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed\nutilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal\ncharacteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any\nleviathan’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully\ninvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\nroundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\nhead, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is\nalso very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which\nalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the\nthumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,\nand little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy\ncovering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However\nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one\nday, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”"

True, one portrait may hit the\nmark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\nconsiderable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\nout precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\nwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by\ngoing a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\nbeing eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you\nhad best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\nLeviathan.CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True\nPictures of Whaling Scenes.In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them\nwhich are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,\nespecially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass\nthat matter by.I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\nColnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous\nchapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far\nbetter than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All\nBeale’s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in\nthe picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second\nchapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no\ndoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\nadmirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\nSperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;\nbut they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\nare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\nbut one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,\nbecause it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you\ncan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by\nhis living hunters."

  "content": "But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\nnot the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\nanywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and\ntaken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent\nattacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble\nSperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath\nthe boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the\nair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\nthe boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\nmonster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\nincomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\nincensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if\nfrom a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\ntrue. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\npoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the\nswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\nof affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\ndown upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical\ndetails of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I\ncould not draw so good a one.In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\nthe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\nblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\nPatagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\nthat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are\npecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\nmaccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\nback. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\nthe deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and\ncausing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh\nthe paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all\nraging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the\nglassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the\npowerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered\nfortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\ninserted into his spout-hole.Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he\nwas either practically conversant with his subject, or else\nmarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the\nlads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,\nand where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing\ncommotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the\nbeholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great\nbattles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern\nLights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\ncharge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that\ngallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery."

With not one tenth of England’s\nexperience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\nAmericans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\nfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the\nwhale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale\ndraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\noutline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so\nfar as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\nsketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned\nRight whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland\nwhale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and\nporpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,\nchopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a\nLeuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six\nfac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement\nto the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so\nimportant a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured\nfor every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of\nthe Peace.In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\nFrench engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself\n“H. Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present\npurpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet\nnoon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,\ninshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened\nsails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,\nboth drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,\nwhen considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen\nunder one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving\nis quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in\nthe very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;\nthe vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to\na quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,\nis about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and\nlances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in\nits hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\nhalf-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the\nsmoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke\nover a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up\nwith earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the\nexcited seamen.CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in\nStone; in Mountains; in Stars."

There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats\n(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is\nbeing crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten\nyears, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited\nthat stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification\nhas now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever\npublished in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a\nstump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for\never mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman\nmake; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own\namputation.Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag\nHarbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm\nWhale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and\nother like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous\nlittle ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough\nmaterial, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little\nboxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their\njack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,\nthey will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner’s\nfancy.Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man\nto that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called\nsavagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I\nmyself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the\nCannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic\nhours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian\nwar-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of\ncarving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.\nFor, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that\nmiraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has\ncost steady years of steady application.As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the\nsame marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of\nhis one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not\nquite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as\nthe Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\nsuggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert\nDurer."

Some of them are done with much\naccuracy.At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung\nby the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is\nsleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales\nare seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some\nold-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for\nweather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all\nintents and purposes so labelled with “_Hands off!_” you cannot examine\nthem closely enough to decide upon their merit.In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken\ncliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,\nyou will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the\nLeviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against\nthem in a surf of green surges.Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is\ncontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from\nsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the\nprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be\na thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you\nwish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the\nexact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,\nelse so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your\nprecise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;\nlike the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once\nhigh-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them."

Thus at the North have I chased\nLeviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright\npoints that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent\nAntarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase\nagainst the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and\nthe Flying Fish.With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for\nspurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to\nsee whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really\nlie encamped beyond my mortal sight!CHAPTER 58. Brit.Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows\nof brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale\nlargely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that\nwe seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden\nwheat.On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from\nthe attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly\nswam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that\nwondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated\nfrom the water that escaped at the lip.As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their\nscythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these\nmonsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving\nbehind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.**That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does\nnot bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there\nbeing shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable\nmeadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually\nfloating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased."

Seen from the mast-heads, especially when\nthey paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms\nlooked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in\nthe great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will\nsometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them\nto be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;\neven so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species\nof the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their\nimmense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such\nbulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with\nthe same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the\ndeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though\nsome old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are\nof their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the\nthing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for\nexample, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to\nthe sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any\ngeneric respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas\nhave ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and\nrepelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,\nso that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his\none superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of\nall mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen\ntens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;\nthough but a moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man\nmay brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering\nfuture, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,\nto the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize\nthe stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the\ncontinual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense\nof the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese\nvengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.\nThat same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships\nof last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided;\ntwo thirds of the fair world it yet covers."

Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,\nwhen under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and\nswallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in\nprecisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it\nis also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who\nmurdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath\nspawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her\nown cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the\nrocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of\nships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting\nlike a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean\noverruns the globe.Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures\nglide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously\nhidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish\nbrilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the\ndainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once\nmore, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey\nupon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile\nearth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a\nstrange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean\nsurrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one\ninsular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the\nhorrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that\nisle, thou canst never return!CHAPTER 59. Squid.Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her\nway north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling\nher keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering\nmasts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a\nplain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,\nalluring jet would be seen."

Thus glistening\nfor a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,\nand silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?\nthought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once\nmore, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,\nthe negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches! right\nahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the\nbees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on\nthe bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave\nhis orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction\nindicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had\ngradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the\nideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular\nwhale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed\nhim; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly\nperceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave\norders for lowering."

Soon it went down, and while, with\noars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot\nwhere it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the\nmoment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous\nphenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A\nvast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing\ncream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms\nradiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of\nanacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.\nNo perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of\neither sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an\nunearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still\ngazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice\nexclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to\nhave seen thee, thou white ghost!”“What was it, Sir?” said Flask.“The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,\nand returned to their ports to tell of it.”But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;\nthe rest as silently following.Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected\nwith the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it\nbeing so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with\nportentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them\ndeclare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few\nof them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature\nand form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm\nwhale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food\nabove water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the\nspermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the\nsurface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,\nprecisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will\ndisgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some\nof them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They\nfancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings\nby them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other\nspecies, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it."
