And\nwho pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no\ngood blood in their veins._No good blood in their veins?_ They have something better than royal\nblood there.

By old English\nstatutory law, the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *Oh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any\ngrand imposing way._The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?_ In one of the\nmighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world’s\ncapital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian\ncoast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.**See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real\ndignity in whaling._No dignity in whaling?_ The dignity of our calling the very heavens\nattest.

Postscript.In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but\nsubstantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who\nshould wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell\neloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would he not be\nblameworthy?It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even\nmodern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their\nfunctions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,\nand there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt,\nprecisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is\nsolemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be,\nthough, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run\nwell, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,\nconcerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in\ncommon life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints\nhis hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man\nwho uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a\nquoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to\nmuch in his totality.But the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil is\nused at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar\noil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.\nWhat then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,\nunpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and\nqueens with coronation stuff!CHAPTER 26.

  "content": "The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\nQuaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an\nicy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being\nhard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood\nwould not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time\nof general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which\nhis state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\nsummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\nthinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties\nand cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was\nmerely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;\nquite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\nlike a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\nlong ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow\nor torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\nwarranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed\nto see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\nhad calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life\nfor the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame\nchapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there\nwere certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some\ncases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,\nthe wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\nhim to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\norganizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\nfrom ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And\nif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more\ndid his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,\ntend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,\nand open him still further to those latent influences which, in some\nhonest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often\nevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I\nwill have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a\nwhale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and\nuseful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the\nencountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more\ndangerous comrade than a coward."

  "content": "“Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as\ncareful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall\nere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a\nman like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\nsentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\nall mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in\nthis business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits\nof the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\nwasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\nsun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\nin fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\nocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for\ntheirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\nWhat doom was his own father’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could\nhe find the torn limbs of his brother?With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\ncould, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But\nit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\nterrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\nthat these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\nhim, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\nconfinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it\nwas that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,\nwhile generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet\ncannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,\nwhich sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged\nand mighty man."

  "content": "But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\nabasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\nto write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose\nthe fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint\nstock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;\nmen may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble\nand so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any\nignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their\ncostliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so\nfar within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character\nseem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a\nvalor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,\ncompletely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But\nthis august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,\nbut that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt\nsee it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that\ndemocratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God;\nHimself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all\ndemocracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall\nhereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic\ngraces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among\nthem all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall\ntouch that workman’s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a\nrainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics\nbear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one\nroyal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou\ngreat democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,\nBunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly\nhammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old\nCervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who\ndidst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a\nthrone! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest\nThy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O\nGod!CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires."

  "content": "Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\naccording to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;\nneither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an\nindifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the\nchase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged\nfor the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his\nwhale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his\ncrew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\narrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about\nthe snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very\ndeath-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and\noff-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his\nold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated\nmonster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death\ninto an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no\ntelling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\nbut, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\ncomfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a\nsort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,\nabout something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and\nnot sooner.What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\nunfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\nworld full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;\nwhat helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that\nthing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black\nlittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\nalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\nnose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever\nhe turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\nthe other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\nreadiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\nlegs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\npeculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,\nwhether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\nmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in\ntime of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated\nhandkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal\ntribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\ndisinfecting agent."

A\nshort, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\nwho somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\nand hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\nhonor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\nwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic\nbulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\nany possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,\nthe wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\nwater-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\nignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\nthe matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\nthree years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\nthat length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought\nnails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\nwas one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\ncalled him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could\nbe well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in\nArctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\ninserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions\nof those battering seas.Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.\nThey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\nPequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which\nCaptain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\nwhales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being\narmed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio\nof lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic\nKnight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,\nwho in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the\nformer one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\nmoreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\nand friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set\ndown who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of\nthem belonged.First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected\nfor his squire. But Queequeg is already known."

In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\nGay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\nand black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\nAntarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\nwarrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had\nscoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer\nsnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now\nhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon\nof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look\nat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have\ncredited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and\nhalf-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers\nof the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s squire."

  "content": "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\nnegro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended\nfrom his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\nthem ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to\nthem. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\nlying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been\nanywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors\nmost frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\nlife of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\nmanner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,\nand erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\nfeet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\nhim; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\nbeg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,\nAhasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a\nchess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it\nsaid, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\nbefore the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\nborn, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same\nwith the American whale fishery as with the American army and military\nand merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the\nconstruction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,\nbecause in all these cases the native American liberally provides the\nbrains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No\nsmall number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the\noutward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews\nfrom the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the\nGreenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland\nIslands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage\nhomewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,\nbut Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all\nIslanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not\nacknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on\na separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,\nwhat a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from\nall the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying\nOld Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar\nfrom which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he\nnever did—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim\nPequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;\nprelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck\non high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in\nglory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!"

This was strangely heightened at\ntimes by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly\nrecurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived\nof. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\nalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish\nprophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\nuneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look\nabout me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\nemotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\nwere a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\ntame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\nacquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the\nfierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation\nin which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the\naspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was\nmost forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and\ninduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\nThree better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own\ndifferent way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of\nthem Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being\nChristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\nbiting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\nsouthward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\ngradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\nweather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey\nand gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the\nship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping\nand melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of\nthe forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the\ntaffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;\nCaptain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck."

He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\nthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\nor taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\nwhole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\nunalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out\nfrom among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\ntawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you\nsaw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\nperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a\ngreat tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\nwithout wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from\ntop to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still\ngreenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or\nwhether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could\ncertainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or\nno allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once\nTashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,\nsuperstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did\nAhab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\nfury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this\nwild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman\ninsinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out\nof Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,\nthe old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested\nthis old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\nwhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\nCaptain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to\npass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the\ndead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole."

It had previously come\nto me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\nbone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said\nthe old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped\nanother mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\nthe Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\nthere was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\nplank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\nholding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\nbeyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest\nfortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\nfearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor\ndid his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\ngestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\nonly that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\nin his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\nmighty woe."

As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\ngrow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\nwhen the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\nbleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\ncame to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\nfor all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\nmaking a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\nthat there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\nAhab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\nlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\nthe loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\nfrom his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and\nMay, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,\nruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some\nfew green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,\nin the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\nair. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\nwhich, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\nrolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\nTropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\nup—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\nsuns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days\nand such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning\nweather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\nworld. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild\nhours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\nmost forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more\nand more they wrought on Ahab’s texture."

Among sea-commanders,\nthe old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\nnight-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\nseemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\nwere more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels\nlike going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an\nold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my\ngrave-dug berth.”So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\nset, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;\nand when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\nflung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\nit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\nthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\nsilent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old\nman would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled\nway. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\nthese, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because\nto his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\nheel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\nstep, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\nsharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;\nand as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\ntaffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,\nwith a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if\nCaptain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\nnay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\nsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\ninsertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know\nAhab then.“Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that\nfashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;\nwhere such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at\nlast.—Down, dog, and kennel!”Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\nscornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,\n“I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half\nlike it, sir.”"

Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go\nback and strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for\nhim? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the\nfirst time I ever _did_ pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer\ntoo; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb\never sailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is\nhe mad? Anyway there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be\nsomething on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,\nmore than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then.\nDidn’t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always\nfinds the old man’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the\nsheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and\nthe pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on\nit? A hot old man! I guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a\nconscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a\ntoothache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me\nfrom catching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the\nafter hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s\nthat for, I should like to know? Who’s made appointments with him in\nthe hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But there’s no telling, it’s the old\ngame—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be\nborn into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think\nof it, that’s about the first thing babies do, and that’s a sort of\nqueer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of ’em.\nBut that’s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh\ncommandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So here goes again.\nBut how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times\na donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that!_ He might as\nwell have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he _did_ kick me, and I\ndidn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It\nflashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I\ndon’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort\nof turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,\nthough—How? how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to\nhammock again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling\nthinks over by daylight.”"

The Pipe.When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the\nbulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\nsailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\nhis pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool\non the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\nfabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could\none look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without\nbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank,\nand a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth\nin quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How\nnow,” he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no\nlonger soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be\ngone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and\nignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with\nsuch nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were\nthe strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this\npipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white\nvapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like\nmine. I’ll smoke no more—”He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the\nwaves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe\nmade. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.Next morning Stubb accosted Flask."

You know the old man’s\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to\nkick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And\nthen, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept\nkicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—you know how\ncurious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow\nseemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an\ninsult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not\na real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between\na living thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the\nhand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.\nThe living member—that makes the living insult, my little man. And\nthinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly\ntoes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it\nall, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg\nnow, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a\nplayful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a\nbase kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the\nfoot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed\nfarmer kicked me, _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is\nwhittled down to a point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the\ndream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of\nbadger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\nshoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid!\nman, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was\nover the fright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what business\nis that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a\nkick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned\nround his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\nhad for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his\nstern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on\nsecond thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’\nsaid he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of\neating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to\nstop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as\nwell fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my\nfoot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I,\n‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s\nargue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’\nsays I—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory\nleg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise\nStubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right good\nwill? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you\nwere kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s\nan honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England\nthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and\nmade garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were\nkicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_\nkicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;\nfor you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’\nWith that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to\nswim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my\nhammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?”"

Ere that come to pass; ere\nthe Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of\nthe leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter\nalmost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the\nmore special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which\nare to follow.It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,\nthat I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The\nclassification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here\nessayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.“No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled\nCetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.“It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry\nas to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families.\n* * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal”\n(sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839."

  "content": "Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen\never saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional\nharpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate\nsubject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing\nauthority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great\nsperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy\nmentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper\nupon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of\nthe whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the\nprofound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the\nthen fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to\nthis present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats\nand whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference\nto nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past\ndays, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was\nto them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a\nnew proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the\nGreenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the\nliving sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest\ndegree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s;\nboth in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both\nexact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to\nbe found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,\nit is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific\ndescription. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,\nlives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted\nwhales, his is an unwritten life.Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular\ncomprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the\npresent, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\nlaborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I\nhereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;\nbecause any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very\nreason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical\ndescription of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much\nof any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of\na systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the\nPost-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea\nafter them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,\nribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I\nthat I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful\ntauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a\ncovenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam\nthrough libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with\nwhales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There\nare some preliminaries to settle."
