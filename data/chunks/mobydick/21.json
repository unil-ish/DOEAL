  "content": "He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly\nencountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been\nan artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house\nand garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three\nblithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,\nplanted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further\nconcealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into\nhis happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to\ntell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into\nhis family’s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of\nthat fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,\nfor prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was\nin the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so\nthat always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no\nunhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing\nof her young-armed old husband’s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled\nby passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,\nin her nursery; and so, to stout Labor’s iron lullaby, the blacksmith’s\ninfants were rocked to slumber.Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?\nHadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came\nupon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her\norphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after\nyears; and all of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked\ndown some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely\nhung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than\nuseless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him\neasier to harvest.Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew\nmore and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the\nlast; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,\nglitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows\nfell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother\ndived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed\nher thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a\nvagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to\nflaxen curls!"

Come\nhither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and\nabhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put\nup _thy_ gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till\nwe marry thee!”Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by\nfall of eve, the blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth\nwent a-whaling.CHAPTER 113. The Forge.With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about\nmid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter\nplaced upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the\ncoals, and with the other at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came\nalong, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While\nyet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,\nPerth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the\nanvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,\nsome of which flew close to Ahab.“Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying\nin thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they\nburn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”“Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth, resting\nfor a moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st\nthou scorch a scar.”“Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful\nto me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others\nthat is not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou\nnot go mad? How can’st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens\nyet hate thee, that thou can’st not go mad?—What wert thou making\nthere?”“Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”“And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard\nusage as it had?”“I think so, sir.”“And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never\nmind how hard the metal, blacksmith?”“Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”"

  "content": "“Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning\nwith both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—_here_—can ye\nsmoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his\nribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my\nhead upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.\nAnswer! Can’st thou smoothe this seam?”“Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”“Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for\nthough thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into\nthe bone of my skull—_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s\nplay; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!” jingling the\nleathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon\nmade; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;\nsomething that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There’s the\nstuff,” flinging the pouch upon the anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith, these\nare the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”“Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the\nbest and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”“I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the\nmelted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me\nfirst, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer\nthese twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick!\nI’ll blow the fire.”When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by\nspiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A\nflaw!” rejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when\nAhab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,\nwith regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to\nhim the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge\nshooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and\nbowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or\nsome blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.“What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered\nStubb, looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a\nfusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”"

  "content": "At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as\nPerth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near\nby, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.“Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain;\n“have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”“Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this\nharpoon for the White Whale?”“For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them\nthyself, man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the\nbarbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would\nfain not use them.“Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,\nnor pray till—but here—to work!”Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the\nshank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the\nblacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to\ntempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.“No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,\nthere! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me\nas much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster\nof dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen\nflesh, and the White Whale’s barbs were then tempered.“Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!”\ndeliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the\nbaptismal blood.Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of\nhickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the\nsocket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some\nfathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.\nPressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,\nthen eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,\n“Good! and now for the seizings.”"

  "content": "At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns\nwere all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole\nwas then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope\nwas traced half-way along the pole’s length, and firmly secured so,\nwith intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope—like the\nThree Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with\nthe weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory\npole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his\ncabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was\nheard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy\nstrange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the\nmelancholy ship, and mocked it!CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising\nground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,\npleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on\nthe stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or\nsailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or\nseventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small\nsuccess for their pains.At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow\nheaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so\nsociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone\ncats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy\nquietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the\nocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and\nwould not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a\nremorseless fang.These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a\ncertain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he\nregards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing\nonly the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high\nrolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when\nthe western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears, while their\nhidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these\nthere steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied\nchildren lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when\nthe flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most\nmystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,\nand form one seamless whole."

  "content": "Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as\ntemporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem\nto open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath\nupon them prove but tarnishing.Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in\nye,—though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye,\nmen yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some\nfew fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them.\nWould to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling\nthreads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a\nstorm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this\nlife; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one\npause:—through infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless\nfaith, adolescence’ doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then\ndisbelief, resting at last in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But\nonce gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and\nmen, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor\nno more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will\nnever weary? Where is the foundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like\nthose orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of\nour paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that\nsame golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—“Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s\neye!—Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping\ncannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep\ndown and do believe.”And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same\ngolden light:—“I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that\nhe has always been jolly!”CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down\nbefore the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded."

  "content": "It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her\nlast cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in\nglad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,\nsailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous\nto pointing her prow for home.The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red\nbunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,\nbottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long\nlower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks\nof all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways\nlashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;\nabove which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of\nthe same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\nlamp.As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most\nsurprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in\nthe same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without\nsecuring a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been\ngiven away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional\nsupplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;\nand these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain’s and\nofficers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked\ninto kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\noil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the\nforecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,\nand filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a\nhead on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged\nhis spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the\nsockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was\nfilled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons pockets, and those\nhe reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of\nhis entire satisfaction."

  "content": "As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\nbarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing\nstill nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\ntry-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin\nof the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the\nclenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and\nharpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with\nthem from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,\nfirmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long\nIsland negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were\npresiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s\ncompany were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from\nwhich the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought\nthey were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they\nraised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the\nsea.Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the\nship’s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was\nfull before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual\ndiversion.And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,\nwith a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s\nwakes—one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings\nas to things to come—their two captains in themselves impersonated the\nwhole striking contrast of the scene.“Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting\na glass and a bottle in the air.“Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.“No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the\nother good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”“Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”“Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old\nhearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow. Come\nalong, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art\na full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an\nempty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward\nthere! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\nstubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew\nof the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the\nreceding Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for\nthe lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the\ntaffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a\nsmall vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed\nthereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was\nfilled with Nantucket soundings.CHAPTER 116.

So seemed\nit with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,\nwhales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the\ncrimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,\nsun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and\nsuch plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy\nair, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent\nvalleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned\nsailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned\noff from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the\nnow tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm\nwhales dying—the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that\nstrange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab\nconveyed a wondrousness unknown before.“He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\nhomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too\nworships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh\nthat these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.\nLook! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in\nthese most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks\nfurnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still\nrolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the\nNiger’s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;\nbut see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it\nheads some other way.“Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded\nthy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;\nthou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the\nwide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor\nhas this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round\nagain, without a lesson to me."

Yet dost thou,\ndarker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy\nunnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of\nonce living things, exhaled as air, but water now.“Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild\nfowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though\nhill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to\nwindward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These\nlast three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one\ncould not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay\nby its side all night; and that boat was Ahab’s.The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and\nthe lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon\nthe black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which\ngently chafed the whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who\ncrouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played\nround the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A\nsound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven\nghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and\nhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a\nflooded world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.“Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor\ncoffin can be thine?”“And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”“But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two\nhearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by\nmortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in\nAmerica.”“Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes\nfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a\nsight we shall not soon see.”“Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”“And what was that saying about thyself?”"

I have here two\npledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”“Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up\nlike fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”“The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried\nAhab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the\nslumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon the dead\nwhale was brought to the ship.CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\ncoming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would\nostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\nthe braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed\non the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s\nprow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon\nhigh noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was\nabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\nlatitude."

That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\nfocus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks\nlacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this\nnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\nGod’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured\nglasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging\nhis seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\nastrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that\nposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun\nshould gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention\nwas absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,\nand with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him;\nonly the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was\nsubdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired\nobservation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab\nsoon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then\nfalling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and\nmurmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou\ntellest me truly where I _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where\nI _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is\nthis moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be\neyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now\nbeholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding\nthe objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\nnumerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\n“Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,\nand Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but\nwhat after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where\nthou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that\nholds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of\nwater or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy\nimpotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;\nand cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven,\nwhose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now\nscorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon\nare the glances of man’s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as\nif God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou\nquadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly\nway by thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by\nlog and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the\nsea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee,\nthou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and\ndestroy thee!”As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and\ndead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a\nfatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the\nmute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;\nwhile, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered\ntogether on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,\nshouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”"

Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of\nthine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”“Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr.\nStarbuck—sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab\nmutter, ‘Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of\nmine; swears that I must play them, and no others.’ And damn me, Ahab,\nbut thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!”CHAPTER 119. The Candles.Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal\ncrouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most\neffulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows\ntornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in\nthese resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of\nall storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that\ncloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and\nbare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly\nahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the\nthunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts\nfluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the\ntempest had left for its after sport."

But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted\nto the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did\nnot escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling\nship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern,\nand left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.“Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck,\n“but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You\nsee, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,\nall round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,\nall the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But\nnever mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song says;”—(_sings_.)Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A’ flourishin’ his\n  tail,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the\n  Ocean, oh!The scud all a flyin’, That’s his flip only foamin’; When he stirs in\n  the spicin’,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\n  is the Ocean, oh!Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin’ of\n  this flip,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\n  is the Ocean, oh!“Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his\nharp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\nthy peace.”“But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;\nand I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.\nStarbuck, there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my\nthroat. And when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a\nwind-up.”“Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”“What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never\nmind how foolish?”“Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his\nhand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes\nfrom the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the\nvery course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where\nis that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his\nstand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou\nmust!“I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”"

  "content": "“Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\nNantucket,” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s\nquestion. “The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\ninto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,\nall is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up\nthere; but not with the lightning.”At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following\nthe flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same\ninstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.“Who’s there?”“Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\npivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\nlances of fire.Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\nthe perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\nships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But\nas this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may\navoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly\ntowing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering\nnot a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the\nvessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a\nship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made\nin long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\nchains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.“The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished\nto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\nflambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them\nover, fore and aft. Quick!”“Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the\nweaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\nAndes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let\nthem be, sir.”“Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\ntri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of\nthe three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like\nthree gigantic wax tapers before an altar."

  "content": "“Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing\nsea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently\njammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping\nbackward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and\nimmediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on us\nall!”To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of\nthe calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses\nfrom the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething\nsea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when\nGod’s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene,\nTekel Upharsin” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\nenchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all\ntheir eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\nconstellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the\ngigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and\nseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted\nmouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely\ngleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by\nthe preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue\nflames on his body.The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more\nthe Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment\nor two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.\nIt was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not\nthe same in the song.”“No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I\nhope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have\nthey no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark\nto look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign\nof good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\nchock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will\nwork up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will\nyet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”"

Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once\nmore the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\nsupernaturalness in their pallor.“The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,\nthe Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away\nfrom him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where\nthey had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\narrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\nknot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various\nenchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running\nskeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all\ntheir eyes upcast.“Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white\nflame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast\nlinks there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against\nit; blood against fire! So.”Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot\nupon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,\nhe stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames."

As the silent harpoon burned there\nlike a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is\nagainst thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill\ncontinued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a\nfair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\nbraces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast\nmate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But\ndashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the\nburning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to\ntransfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end.\nPetrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart\nthat he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—“All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and\nheart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye\nmay know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out\nthe last fear!” And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the\nflame.As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of\nsome lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it\nso much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for\nthunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did\nrun from him in a terror of dismay.CHAPTER 120.
