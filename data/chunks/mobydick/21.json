  "content": "Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at\nevery flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional\ndisaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb\nand Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer\nlashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted\nto the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did\nnot escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling\nship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern,\nand left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.“Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck,\n“but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You\nsee, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,\nall round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,\nall the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But\nnever mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song says;”—(_sings_.)Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A’ flourishin’ his\n  tail,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the\n  Ocean, oh!The scud all a flyin’, That’s his flip only foamin’; When he stirs in\n  the spicin’,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\n  is the Ocean, oh!Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin’ of\n  this flip,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\n  is the Ocean, oh!“Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his\nharp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\nthy peace.”“But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;\nand I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.\nStarbuck, there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my\nthroat. And when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a\nwind-up.”“Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”“What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never\nmind how foolish?”“Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his\nhand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes\nfrom the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the\nvery course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where\nis that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his\nstand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou\nmust!“I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”"

  "content": "“Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\nNantucket,” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s\nquestion. “The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\ninto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,\nall is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up\nthere; but not with the lightning.”At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following\nthe flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same\ninstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.“Who’s there?”“Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\npivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\nlances of fire.Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\nthe perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\nships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But\nas this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may\navoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly\ntowing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering\nnot a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the\nvessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a\nship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made\nin long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\nchains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.“The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished\nto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\nflambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them\nover, fore and aft. Quick!”“Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the\nweaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\nAndes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let\nthem be, sir.”“Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\ntri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of\nthe three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like\nthree gigantic wax tapers before an altar."

  "content": "“Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing\nsea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently\njammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping\nbackward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and\nimmediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on us\nall!”To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of\nthe calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses\nfrom the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething\nsea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when\nGod’s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene,\nTekel Upharsin” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\nenchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all\ntheir eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\nconstellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the\ngigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and\nseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted\nmouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely\ngleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by\nthe preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue\nflames on his body.The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more\nthe Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment\nor two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.\nIt was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not\nthe same in the song.”“No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I\nhope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have\nthey no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark\nto look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign\nof good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\nchock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will\nwork up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will\nyet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”"

Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once\nmore the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\nsupernaturalness in their pallor.“The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,\nthe Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away\nfrom him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where\nthey had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\narrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\nknot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various\nenchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running\nskeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all\ntheir eyes upcast.“Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white\nflame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast\nlinks there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against\nit; blood against fire! So.”Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot\nupon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,\nhe stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames."

To neither love nor\nreverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst but kill; and\nall are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,\nplaceless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will\ndispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.

Nor was it wrung\nfrom me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can\nthen grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the\nhomage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands.

Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though\nthou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of\nlight, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?\nThere burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my\ngenealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know\nnot. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but\nthine is greater.

There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear\nspirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness\nmechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly\nsee it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast\nthy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with\nhaughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap\nwith thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly\nI worship thee!”“The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”"

As the silent harpoon burned there\nlike a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is\nagainst thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill\ncontinued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a\nfair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\nbraces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast\nmate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But\ndashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the\nburning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to\ntransfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end.\nPetrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart\nthat he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—“All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and\nheart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye\nmay know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out\nthe last fear!” And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the\nflame.As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of\nsome lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it\nso much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for\nthunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did\nrun from him in a terror of dismay.CHAPTER 120. The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch._Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him._“We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working\nloose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”“Strike nothing; lash it.

Besides, supposing we _are_ loaded with powder\nbarrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get\nafire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty\nred hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake yourself; you’re\nAquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat\ncollar. Don’t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine\nInsurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask.\nBut hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other thing. First take your\nleg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the\nrope; now listen. What’s the mighty difference between holding a mast’s\nlightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn’t\ngot any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don’t you see, you\ntimber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the\nmast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in\na hundred carries rods, and Ahab,—aye, man, and all of us,—were in no\nmore danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten\nthousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose\nyou would have every man in the world go about with a small\nlightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia\nofficer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why\ndon’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t ye,\nthen? any man with half an eye can be sensible.”“I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”“Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s\na fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the\nturn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors\nnow as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two\nanchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man’s hands behind him. And\nwhat big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron\nfists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the\nworld is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long\ncable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next\nto touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say,\njust wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at\nlong-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always\nto be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way,\nserve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same with cocked hats; the\ncocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and\ntarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a\nbeaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord,\nLord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!\nThis is a nasty night, lad.”CHAPTER 122. Midnight Aloft.—Thunder and Lightning._The main-top-sail yard_.—_Tashtego passing new lashings around it_.“Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up here. What’s\nthe use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don’t want thunder; we want rum;\ngive us a glass of rum. Um, um, um!”CHAPTER 123. The Musket.During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s\njaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by\nits spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached\nto it—for they were slack—because some play to the tiller was\nindispensable."

  "content": "In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock\nto the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the\ncompasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the\nPequod’s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice\nthe whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a\nsight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted\nemotion.Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\nstrenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the\nother aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails\nwere cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like\nthe feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds\nwhen that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a\nstorm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through\nthe water with some precision again; and the course—for the present,\nEast-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more\ngiven to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only\nsteered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the\nship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile,\nlo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul\nbreeze became fair!Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “_Ho! the fair\nwind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!_” the crew singing for joy, that so\npromising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents\npreceding it.In compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report\nimmediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided\nchange in the affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the\nyards to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,—than he\nmechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance."

The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded\nso, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world\nboomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the\ninvisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;\nwhere his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned\nBabylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a\ncrucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time\nthe tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to\neye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly\nsettled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward\nplace, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating\nwake."

The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod\nthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair\none had only been juggling her.Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\nnothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\nFlask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\nfeelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some\nof them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear\nof Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost\nwholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\nmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But\nchancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper\nsight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.“Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked\nthee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But\nAhab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without\na pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles.\nQuick!”Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about\nto do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to\nrevive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a\nmatter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old\nman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\npracticable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious\nsailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.“Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him\nthe things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s\nneedles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own,\nthat will point as true as any.”Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as\nthis was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic\nmight follow. But Starbuck looked away."

Then, with the\nmaul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he\nplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly\nhammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.\nThen going through some small strange motions with it—whether\nindispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to\naugment the awe of the crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread;\nand moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,\nand horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of\nthe compass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering\nand vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when\nAhab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly\nback from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,\nexclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level\nloadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!”One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could\npersuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk\naway.In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his\nfatal pride.CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log\nand line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance\nupon other means of determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen,\nand many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave\nthe log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake\nthan anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the\ncourse steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of\nprogression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden\nreel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the\nrailing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and\nwind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that\nhung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he\nhappened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet\nscene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his\nfrantic oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing\nplungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.“Forward, there! Heave the log!”Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.\n“Take the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where the\ndeck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into\nthe creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\nhandle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so\nstood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to\nhim."

Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?\nThou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”“I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey\nhairs of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a\nsuperior, who’ll ne’er confess.”“What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s\ngranite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert\nthou born?”“In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”“Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”“I know not, sir, but I was born there.”“In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man\nfrom Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;\nwhich is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall\nbutts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.”The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long\ndragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In\nturn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing\nresistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.“Hold hard!”Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the\ntugging log was gone.“I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad\nsea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;\nreel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and\nmend thou the line. See to it.”“There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer\nseems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,\nTahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and\ndragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”"

The Life-Buoy.Steering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her progress\nsolely determined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod held on her\npath towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such\nunfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways\nimpelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all\nthese seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and\ndesperate scene.At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before\nthe dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then\nheaded by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\nunearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod’s\nmurdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their reveries,\nand for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all\ntransfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild\ncry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the\ncrew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers\nremained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman—the oldest mariner of\nall—declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the\nvoices of newly drowned men in the sea.Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he\ncame to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not\nunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus\nexplained the wonder."

But this only the more affected some of them, because most\nmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not\nonly from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the\nhuman look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen\npeeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain\ncircumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At\nsun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;\nand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for\nsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus\nwith the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had\nnot been long at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry and a\nrushing—and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and\nlooking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the\nsea.The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern, where it\nalways hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,\nand the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it\nslowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and\nthe studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to\nyield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out\nfor the White Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar ground; that man\nwas swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the\ntime. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at\nleast as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of\nevil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.\nThey declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they\nhad heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay."

Dost thou hear me?

And now I’m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s like\nturning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I\ndon’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it at all; it’s\nundignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we\nare their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,\nfair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\nthe beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at\nthe conclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at an end in the middle,\nand at the beginning at the end. It’s the old woman’s tricks to be\ngiving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for\ntinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a\nbald-headed young tinker once.

But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\nme see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with\npitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over\nthe ship’s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some\nsuperstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere\nthey would do the job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I\ndon’t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard\ntray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and\ncard-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or\nby the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore\nof our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it\nif we can. Hem! I’ll do the job, now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s\nsee—how many in the ship’s company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any\nway, I’ll have me thirty separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three\nfeet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,\nthere’ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight\nnot seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron,\npitch-pot, and marling-spike!
