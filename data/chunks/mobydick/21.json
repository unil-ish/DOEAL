  "content": "It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her\nlast cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in\nglad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,\nsailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous\nto pointing her prow for home.The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red\nbunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,\nbottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long\nlower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks\nof all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways\nlashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;\nabove which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of\nthe same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\nlamp.As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most\nsurprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in\nthe same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without\nsecuring a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been\ngiven away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional\nsupplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;\nand these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain’s and\nofficers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked\ninto kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\noil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the\nforecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,\nand filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a\nhead on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged\nhis spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the\nsockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was\nfilled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons pockets, and those\nhe reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of\nhis entire satisfaction."

  "content": "As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\nbarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing\nstill nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\ntry-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin\nof the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the\nclenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and\nharpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with\nthem from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,\nfirmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long\nIsland negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were\npresiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s\ncompany were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from\nwhich the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought\nthey were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they\nraised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the\nsea.Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the\nship’s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was\nfull before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual\ndiversion.And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,\nwith a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s\nwakes—one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings\nas to things to come—their two captains in themselves impersonated the\nwhole striking contrast of the scene.“Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting\na glass and a bottle in the air.“Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.“No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the\nother good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”“Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”“Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old\nhearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow. Come\nalong, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art\na full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an\nempty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward\nthere! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\nstubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew\nof the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the\nreceding Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for\nthe lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the\ntaffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a\nsmall vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed\nthereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was\nfilled with Nantucket soundings.CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale."

  "content": "Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites\nsail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the\nrushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed\nit with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,\nwhales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the\ncrimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,\nsun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and\nsuch plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy\nair, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent\nvalleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned\nsailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned\noff from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the\nnow tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm\nwhales dying—the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that\nstrange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab\nconveyed a wondrousness unknown before.“He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\nhomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too\nworships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh\nthat these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.\nLook! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in\nthese most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks\nfurnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still\nrolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the\nNiger’s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;\nbut see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it\nheads some other way.“Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded\nthy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;\nthou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the\nwide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor\nhas this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round\nagain, without a lesson to me."

In\nvain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening\nsun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou,\ndarker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy\nunnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of\nonce living things, exhaled as air, but water now.“Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild\nfowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though\nhill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to\nwindward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These\nlast three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one\ncould not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay\nby its side all night; and that boat was Ahab’s.The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and\nthe lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon\nthe black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which\ngently chafed the whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who\ncrouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played\nround the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A\nsound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven\nghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and\nhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a\nflooded world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.“Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor\ncoffin can be thine?”“And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”“But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two\nhearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by\nmortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in\nAmerica.”“Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes\nfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a\nsight we shall not soon see.”“Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”“And what was that saying about thyself?”"

I have here two\npledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”“Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up\nlike fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”“The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried\nAhab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the\nslumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon the dead\nwhale was brought to the ship.CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\ncoming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would\nostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\nthe braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed\non the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s\nprow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon\nhigh noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was\nabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\nlatitude."

  "content": "Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\neffulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\nfocus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks\nlacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this\nnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\nGod’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured\nglasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging\nhis seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\nastrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that\nposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun\nshould gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention\nwas absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,\nand with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him;\nonly the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was\nsubdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired\nobservation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab\nsoon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then\nfalling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and\nmurmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou\ntellest me truly where I _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where\nI _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is\nthis moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be\neyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now\nbeholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding\nthe objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\nnumerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\n“Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,\nand Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but\nwhat after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where\nthou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that\nholds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of\nwater or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy\nimpotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;\nand cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven,\nwhose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now\nscorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon\nare the glances of man’s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as\nif God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou\nquadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly\nway by thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by\nlog and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the\nsea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee,\nthou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and\ndestroy thee!”As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and\ndead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a\nfatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the\nmute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;\nwhile, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered\ntogether on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,\nshouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”"

Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of\nthine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”“Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr.\nStarbuck—sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab\nmutter, ‘Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of\nmine; swears that I must play them, and no others.’ And damn me, Ahab,\nbut thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!”CHAPTER 119. The Candles.Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal\ncrouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most\neffulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows\ntornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in\nthese resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of\nall storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that\ncloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and\nbare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly\nahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the\nthunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts\nfluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the\ntempest had left for its after sport."

But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted\nto the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did\nnot escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling\nship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern,\nand left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.“Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck,\n“but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You\nsee, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,\nall round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,\nall the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But\nnever mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song says;”—(_sings_.)Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A’ flourishin’ his\n  tail,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the\n  Ocean, oh!The scud all a flyin’, That’s his flip only foamin’; When he stirs in\n  the spicin’,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\n  is the Ocean, oh!Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin’ of\n  this flip,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\n  is the Ocean, oh!“Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his\nharp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\nthy peace.”“But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;\nand I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.\nStarbuck, there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my\nthroat. And when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a\nwind-up.”“Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”“What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never\nmind how foolish?”“Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his\nhand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes\nfrom the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the\nvery course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where\nis that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his\nstand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou\nmust!“I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”"

  "content": "“Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\nNantucket,” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s\nquestion. “The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\ninto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,\nall is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up\nthere; but not with the lightning.”At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following\nthe flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same\ninstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.“Who’s there?”“Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\npivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\nlances of fire.Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\nthe perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\nships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But\nas this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may\navoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly\ntowing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering\nnot a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the\nvessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a\nship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made\nin long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\nchains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.“The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished\nto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\nflambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them\nover, fore and aft. Quick!”“Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the\nweaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\nAndes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let\nthem be, sir.”“Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\ntri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of\nthe three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like\nthree gigantic wax tapers before an altar."

  "content": "“Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing\nsea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently\njammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping\nbackward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and\nimmediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on us\nall!”To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of\nthe calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses\nfrom the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething\nsea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when\nGod’s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene,\nTekel Upharsin” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\nenchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all\ntheir eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\nconstellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the\ngigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and\nseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted\nmouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely\ngleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by\nthe preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue\nflames on his body.The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more\nthe Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment\nor two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.\nIt was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not\nthe same in the song.”“No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I\nhope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have\nthey no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark\nto look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign\nof good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\nchock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will\nwork up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will\nyet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”"

Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once\nmore the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\nsupernaturalness in their pallor.“The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,\nthe Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away\nfrom him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where\nthey had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\narrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\nknot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various\nenchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running\nskeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all\ntheir eyes upcast.“Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white\nflame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast\nlinks there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against\nit; blood against fire! So.”Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot\nupon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,\nhe stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames."

The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?\nThere burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my\ngenealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know\nnot. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but\nthine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself\nunbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself\nunbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou\nomnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear\nspirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness\nmechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly\nsee it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast\nthy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with\nhaughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap\nwith thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly\nI worship thee!”“The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”"

As the silent harpoon burned there\nlike a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is\nagainst thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill\ncontinued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a\nfair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\nbraces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast\nmate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But\ndashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the\nburning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to\ntransfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end.\nPetrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart\nthat he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—“All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and\nheart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye\nmay know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out\nthe last fear!” And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the\nflame.As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of\nsome lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it\nso much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for\nthunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did\nrun from him in a terror of dismay.CHAPTER 120. The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch._Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him._“We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working\nloose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”“Strike nothing; lash it.

Why, my little man, you have pretty\nred hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake yourself; you’re\nAquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat\ncollar. Don’t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine\nInsurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask.\nBut hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other thing. First take your\nleg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the\nrope; now listen. What’s the mighty difference between holding a mast’s\nlightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn’t\ngot any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don’t you see, you\ntimber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the\nmast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in\na hundred carries rods, and Ahab,—aye, man, and all of us,—were in no\nmore danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten\nthousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose\nyou would have every man in the world go about with a small\nlightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia\nofficer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why\ndon’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t ye,\nthen? any man with half an eye can be sensible.”“I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”“Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s\na fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the\nturn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors\nnow as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two\nanchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man’s hands behind him. And\nwhat big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron\nfists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the\nworld is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long\ncable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next\nto touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say,\njust wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at\nlong-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always\nto be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way,\nserve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same with cocked hats; the\ncocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and\ntarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a\nbeaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord,\nLord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!\nThis is a nasty night, lad.”CHAPTER 122.

The Musket.During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s\njaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by\nits spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached\nto it—for they were slack—because some play to the tiller was\nindispensable."

It was thus with the\nPequod’s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice\nthe whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a\nsight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted\nemotion.Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\nstrenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the\nother aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails\nwere cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like\nthe feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds\nwhen that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a\nstorm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through\nthe water with some precision again; and the course—for the present,\nEast-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more\ngiven to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only\nsteered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the\nship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile,\nlo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul\nbreeze became fair!Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “_Ho! the fair\nwind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!_” the crew singing for joy, that so\npromising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents\npreceding it.In compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report\nimmediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided\nchange in the affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the\nyards to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,—than he\nmechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance."

The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded\nso, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world\nboomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the\ninvisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;\nwhere his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned\nBabylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a\ncrucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time\nthe tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to\neye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly\nsettled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward\nplace, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating\nwake."

Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two\ncompasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the\nold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened\nbefore. Mr. Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s\nall. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”“Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,\ngloomily.Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than\none case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as\ndeveloped in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one\nwith the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much\nmarvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning\nhas actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars\nand rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more\nfatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before\nmagnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle.\nBut in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the\noriginal virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be\naffected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;\neven were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson."

The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod\nthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair\none had only been juggling her.Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\nnothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\nFlask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\nfeelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some\nof them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear\nof Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost\nwholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\nmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But\nchancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper\nsight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.“Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked\nthee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But\nAhab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without\na pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles.\nQuick!”Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about\nto do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to\nrevive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a\nmatter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old\nman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\npracticable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious\nsailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.“Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him\nthe things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s\nneedles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own,\nthat will point as true as any.”Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as\nthis was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic\nmight follow. But Starbuck looked away."
