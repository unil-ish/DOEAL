  "content": "All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\nswaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were\nhoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and\nwhile peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the\nmain-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the\nair. “There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is\nMoby Dick!”Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\nlook-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\nwhale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\nperch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\nbeneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s\nhead was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale\nwas now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing\nhis high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into\nthe air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they\nhad so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.“And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men\nall around him.“I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\ncried out,” said Tashtego.“Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\nreserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised\nthe White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she\nblows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,\nmethodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale’s\nvisible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down\ntop-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay\non board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;\nsteady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All\nready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;\nlower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.“He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from\nus; cannot have seen the ship yet.”“Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!\nShiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”"

  "content": "Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails\nset—all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\nleeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\nFedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\nbut only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\nstill more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\nnoon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter\ncame so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling\nhump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated\nthing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,\ngreenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly\nprojecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\nwaters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\nforehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and\nbehind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\nvalley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\ndanced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of\nhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their\nfitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull\nof an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected\nfrom the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\nsoft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\nthe fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail\nfeathers streaming like pennons.A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\nthe gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\nravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\neyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\nrippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\ngreat majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\ndivinely swam."

  "content": "On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once\nleaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale\nshed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\nnamelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\nto assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\ntornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\nwho for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\nthou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\nwaves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\nDick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\nsubmerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\nBut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an\ninstant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s\nNatural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,\nthe grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\nHoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\nthe three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.“An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed\nbeyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\nvacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\nwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze\nnow freshened; the sea began to swell.“The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego."

  "content": "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now\nall flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began\nfluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\nexpectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could\ndiscover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\ninto its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\nwhite weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\nrose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\ncrooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;\nhis vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\nThe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\ntomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\nthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\nFedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\nseizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\nstand by to stern.Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\nits bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet\nunder water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\nmalicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\nhimself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\nlengthwise beneath the boat.Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\nan instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a\nbiting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\nmouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\nthe open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\npearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s\nhead, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\nnow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\nunastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the\nuttermost stern."

  "content": "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\nwhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\nbody being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\nthe bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while\nthe other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\nimpossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\nthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\nhelpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\nthe long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\nits gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\nfrail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in\ntwain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the\ntwo floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the\ncrew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold\nfast to the oars to lash them across.At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\nto perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\nmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\nslipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as\nit slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him\nout of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the\nsea.Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\ndistance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\nbillows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\nso that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet\nout of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\ndazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\nstill higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\nbillows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\noverleap its summit with their scud.*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\ndesignation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\nup-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\npitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best\nand most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him."

  "content": "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\nand round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\nwake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly\nassault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the\nblood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the\nbook of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the\nwhale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he\ncould still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\nhelpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\nchance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\ndrifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\nlook to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s\naspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\nboats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\nthe eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\ncase could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,\nthey remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had\nnow become the old man’s head.Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s\nmast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\nand was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on\nthe”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\nwhelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\nto rise on a towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him\noff!”The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\nshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly\nswam off, the boats flew to the rescue.Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\nbrine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a\ntime, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden\nunder foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from\nhim, as desolate sounds from out ravines.But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\nabbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense\nto one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\nthrough feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\nin each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\naggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\nintensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\ncontain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\none bended arm—“is it safe?”“Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are\nfive men.”"

  "content": "“That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!\nthere! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!\nThe eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;\nthe helm!”It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\nup by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is\nthus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.\nBut the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the\nwhale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with\na velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these\ncircumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely\nprolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long\na period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,\nthen, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate\nmeans of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,\nand were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked\nboat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything\nto her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways\noutstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an\nalbatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At\nthe well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was\nregularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\nreported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing\nthe deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\nallotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now?\nD’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded\nthem to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now\naloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks."

  "content": "As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\naloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a\nstill greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,\nat every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped\nupon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered\nstern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded\nsky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old\nman’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to\nevince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in\nhis Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The\nthistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”“What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did\nI not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could\nswear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a\nwreck.”“Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen,\nand an ill one.”“Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to\nman, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and\ngive an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles\nof one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye\ntwo are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the\npeopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How\nnow? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he\nspout ten times a second!”The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.\nSoon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.“Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.“How heading when last seen?”“As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”"

Helm\nthere! keep her full before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send\na fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till\nmorning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men,\nthis gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till\nthe White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,\nupon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on\nthat day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be\ndivided among all of ye! Away now!—the deck is thine, sir!”And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\nslouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\nrousing himself to see how the night wore on.CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light\nto spread.“See nothing, sir.”“Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought\nfor;—the top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all\nnight.

  "content": "Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular\nwhale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is\na thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is\nthe wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible\nconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket\ncommanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last\ndescried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty\naccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to\nswim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of\nprogression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a\npilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he\nwell knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at\nsome further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes\nthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more\ncertainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be\nvisited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for\nafter being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of\ndaylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’s future\nwake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious\nmind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this\nhunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in\nwater, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the\nsteadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\nis so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\nhands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly\nsay of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a\nspot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions\nwhen these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so\nmany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have\nabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to\nrender this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the\nsea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what present avail to the\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\nexactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable\nfrom these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the\nchase of whales."

This ship and I are two\nbrave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,\non the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel.

The frenzies\nof the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\nworked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\nhave felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\ngrowing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\nas timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\nof Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the\nprevious day; the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed,\nunfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\ntowards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\nalong. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\nthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race."

For as the one ship that held them all;\nthough it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,\nand pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each\nother in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\nand directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\nof the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\nall varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\nfatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\nhand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\nyards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\ntheir fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\nseek out the thing that might destroy them!“Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after\nthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\n“Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd\njet that way, and then disappears.”It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\nother thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\nhardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\npin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\nair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\nhalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship\nthan the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick\nbodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\nby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the\nWhite Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\nphenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\nfurthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\npure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows\nhis place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,\nthe torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,\nthis breaching is his act of defiance."

So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\nfor the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\nintensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.“Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour\nand thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\nfore. The boats!—stand by!”Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\nshooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\nhalyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\nfrom his perch.“Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,\nrigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep\naway from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\nthree crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\nthem he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up\nto his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\nsuch a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong\nvision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\nboats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\nchurning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\nrushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\nappalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\nfrom every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\nof which those boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly\nwheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\neluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the\ntime, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds."

Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\nline: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping\nthat way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage\nthan the embattled teeth of sharks!Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\nand lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\nand dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one\nthing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\nwithin—through—and then, without—the rays of steel; dragged in the line\nbeyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering\nthe rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\nthe sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so\ndoing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask\ntowards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\nsurf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a\nboiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\nthe wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\nstirred bowl of punch.While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\nthe revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\naslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\nhis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was\nlustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old\nman’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\nrescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\nconcreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\nHeaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\nfrom the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\nbottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\nagain—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\nit, like seals from a sea-side cave."

But soon, as if satisfied that his work\nfor that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\nocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\nleeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\ncame bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\nfloating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\nand safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,\nand ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\ninextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these\nwere there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen\nany one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly\nclinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy\nfloat; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\ninstead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\nStarbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\nleg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.“Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he\nwill; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I\nput good work into that leg.”“But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.“Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a\nbroken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\nmine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,\nnor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and\ninaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape\nyonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”“Dead to leeward, sir.”“Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of\nthe spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s\ncrews.”“Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”“Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\nunconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”"

Surely I have not seen him yet.\nBy heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the\nParsee was not there.“The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”“The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\nforecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was\nnowhere to be found.“Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought\nI saw him dragging under.”“_My_ line! _my_ line?

Two days chased; twice stove\nto splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil\nshadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:—what more\nwouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he\nswamps the last man?

But in this\nmatter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this\nhand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This\nwhole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion\nyears before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act\nunder orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand round\nme, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered\nlance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but\nAhab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel\nstrained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a\ngale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till\nye hear _that_, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe\nye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!\nFor ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface;\nthen rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s\nfloated—tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but\nonly to spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”“As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.“And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he\nmuttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same\nto Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek\nto drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The\nParsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was\nto be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s a riddle now\nmight baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of\njudges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. _I’ll_, _I’ll_ solve it,\nthough!”When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on\nthe previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the\ngrindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by\nlanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and\nsharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken\nkeel of Ahab’s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while\nstill as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his\nscuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its\ndial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the\nsolitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the\ndaylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight."

What a lovely day\nagain! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the\nangels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a\nfairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had\nAhab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;\n_that’s_ tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only\nhas that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness\nand a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too\nmuch for that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very\ncalm—frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the\ncontents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing\nnow; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like\nthat sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy\nclefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow\nit; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the\ntossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this\nthrough prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and\nventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.\nOut upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a\nwicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink\nthere. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever\nconquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run\ntilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that\nstrikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.\nEven Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than _that_. Would now the\nwind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and\noutrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as\nobjects, not as agents. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a\nmost malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that\nthere’s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm\nTrade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in\nstrong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,\nhowever the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest\nMississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go\nat last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly\nblow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them—something so\nunchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along!

Come down, all of ye, but the regular look\nouts!

We’ll talk to-morrow,\nnay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and\ntail.”He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered\nthrough the cloven blue air to the deck.In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’s\nstern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the\nmate,—who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause.“Starbuck!”“Sir?”“For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”“Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”“Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,\nStarbuck!”“Truth, sir: saddest truth.”“Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the\nflood;—and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb,\nStarbuck. I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.“Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a\nbrave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”“Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him. “Stand by\nthe crew!”In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.“The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window\nthere; “O master, my master, come back!”But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the\nboat leaped on."

It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats\nin those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them\nin the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of\nmarching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that\nhad been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first\ndescried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such\ntiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the\nsenses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect\nthem,—however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without\nmolesting the others.“Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and\nfollowing with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly\nto that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by\nthem, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For\nwhen three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be\nsure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the\nevening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may.
