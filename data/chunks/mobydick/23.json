We must not run over him before\nmorning; he’s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm\nthere! keep her full before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send\na fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till\nmorning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men,\nthis gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till\nthe White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,\nupon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on\nthat day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be\ndivided among all of ye! Away now!—the deck is thine, sir!”And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\nslouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\nrousing himself to see how the night wore on.CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light\nto spread.“See nothing, sir.”“Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought\nfor;—the top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all\nnight. But no matter—’tis but resting for the rush.”"

  "content": "Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular\nwhale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is\na thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is\nthe wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible\nconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket\ncommanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last\ndescried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty\naccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to\nswim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of\nprogression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a\npilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he\nwell knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at\nsome further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes\nthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more\ncertainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be\nvisited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for\nafter being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of\ndaylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’s future\nwake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious\nmind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this\nhunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in\nwater, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the\nsteadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\nis so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\nhands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly\nsay of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a\nspot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions\nwhen these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so\nmany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have\nabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to\nrender this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the\nsea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what present avail to the\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\nexactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable\nfrom these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the\nchase of whales."

This ship and I are two\nbrave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,\non the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait\nthat leaves no dust behind!”“There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was now the\nmast-head cry.“Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split\nyour spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your\ntrump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller\nshuts his watergate upon the stream!”And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies\nof the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\nworked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\nhave felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\ngrowing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\nas timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\nof Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the\nprevious day; the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed,\nunfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\ntowards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\nalong. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\nthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race."

For as the one ship that held them all;\nthough it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,\nand pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each\nother in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\nand directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\nof the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\nall varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\nfatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\nhand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\nyards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\ntheir fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\nseek out the thing that might destroy them!“Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after\nthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\n“Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd\njet that way, and then disappears.”It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\nother thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\nhardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\npin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\nair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\nhalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship\nthan the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick\nbodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\nby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the\nWhite Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\nphenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\nfurthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\npure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows\nhis place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,\nthe torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,\nthis breaching is his act of defiance."

So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\nfor the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\nintensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.“Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour\nand thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\nfore. The boats!—stand by!”Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\nshooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\nhalyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\nfrom his perch.“Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,\nrigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep\naway from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\nthree crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\nthem he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up\nto his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\nsuch a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong\nvision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\nboats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\nchurning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\nrushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\nappalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\nfrom every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\nof which those boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly\nwheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\neluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the\ntime, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds."

Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\nline: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping\nthat way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage\nthan the embattled teeth of sharks!Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\nand lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\nand dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one\nthing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\nwithin—through—and then, without—the rays of steel; dragged in the line\nbeyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering\nthe rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\nthe sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so\ndoing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask\ntowards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\nsurf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a\nboiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\nthe wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\nstirred bowl of punch.While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\nthe revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\naslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\nhis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was\nlustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old\nman’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\nrescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\nconcreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\nHeaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\nfrom the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\nbottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\nagain—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\nit, like seals from a sea-side cave."

But soon, as if satisfied that his work\nfor that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\nocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\nleeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\ncame bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\nfloating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\nand safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,\nand ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\ninextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these\nwere there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen\nany one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly\nclinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy\nfloat; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\ninstead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\nStarbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\nleg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.“Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he\nwill; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I\nput good work into that leg.”“But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.“Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a\nbroken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\nmine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,\nnor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and\ninaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape\nyonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”“Dead to leeward, sir.”“Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of\nthe spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s\ncrews.”“Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”“Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!

Upon mustering the company, the\nParsee was not there.“The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”“The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\nforecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was\nnowhere to be found.“Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought\nI saw him dragging under.”“_My_ line! _my_ line?

Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand round\nme, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered\nlance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but\nAhab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel\nstrained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a\ngale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till\nye hear _that_, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe\nye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!\nFor ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface;\nthen rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s\nfloated—tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but\nonly to spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”“As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.“And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he\nmuttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same\nto Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek\nto drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The\nParsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was\nto be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s a riddle now\nmight baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of\njudges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. _I’ll_, _I’ll_ solve it,\nthough!”When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on\nthe previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the\ngrindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by\nlanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and\nsharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken\nkeel of Ahab’s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while\nstill as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his\nscuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its\ndial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the\nsolitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the\ndaylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight."

God only\nhas that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness\nand a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too\nmuch for that.

My legs\nfeel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats\nit yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak\naloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft\nthere!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark well the whale!—Ho!\nagain!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears the vane”—pointing\nto the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with\nit!—Where’s the old man now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder,\nshudder!”The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a\ndownward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but\nintending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a\nlittle sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the\nprofoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered\nagainst the opposing bow.“Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads\ndrive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and\nno hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”"

A low rumbling sound was heard; a\nsubterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with\ntrailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,\nbut obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,\nit hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping\nback into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for\nan instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of\nflakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the\nmarble trunk of the whale.“Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to\nthe attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in\nhim, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell\nfrom heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad\nwhite forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;\nas head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more\nflailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two\nmates’ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,\nbut leaving Ahab’s almost without a scar.While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the\nwhale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he\nshot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round\nand round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in\nwhich, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of\nthe lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his\nsable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old\nAhab.The harpoon dropped from his hand.“Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see\nthee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the\nhearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of\nthy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those\nboats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;\nif not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that but\noffers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are\nnot other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the\nwhale? gone down again?”"

He seemed swimming with his\nutmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight\npath in the sea.“Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third\nday, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that\nmadly seekest him!”Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\nto leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding\nby the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he\nleaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and\nfollow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,\nhe saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\nmast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\nwhich had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\nrepairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he\nsped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying\nthemselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all\nthis; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers\nseemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking\nthat the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to\nTashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another\nflag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to\nhis swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\nlatent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\nWhale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly\nnearing him once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not\nbeen so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves\nthe unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to\nthe boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades\nbecame jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at\nalmost every dip."

Pull\non! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”“But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”“They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he\nmuttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\nAhab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm! take the\nhelm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward\nto the bows of the still flying boat.At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with\nthe White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\nadvance—as the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the\nsmoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled\nround his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\nwith body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\npoise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\nhated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked\ninto a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his\nnigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so\nsuddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated\npart of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have\nbeen tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew\nnot the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for\nits effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two\nof them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a\ncombing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man\nhelplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\ninstantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\nsea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\nthe line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their\nseats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line\nfelt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!"

Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!\nBurst in upon him!”Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled\nround to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,\ncatching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing\nin it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a\nlarger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing\nprow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands!\nstretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”“The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.“Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for\never too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I\nsee: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\nsledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks\nburst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat\nlay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,\ntrying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer\nremained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as\nwith a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own\nforward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the\nbowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon\nas he.“The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of\nair, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a\nwoman’s fainting fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is\nthis the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?\nOh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up\nhelm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on\ntowards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me\nnow!”"

I grin at thee,\nthou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins\nof as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.

I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope\nmy poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will\nnow come to her, for the voyage is up.”From the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,\nbits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their\nhands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all\ntheir enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side\nstrangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of\noverspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,\nswift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of\nall that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead\nsmote the ship’s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell\nflat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the\nharpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,\nthey heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.“The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat;\n“its wood could only be American!”Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its\nkeel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far\noff the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a\ntime, he lay quiescent."

Ahab stooped to\nclear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the\nneck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was\nshot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the\nheavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew out of the stark-empty\ntub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its\ndepths.For an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The\nship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering\nmediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata\nMorgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by\ninfatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the\npagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.\nAnd now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its\ncrew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,\nanimate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the\nsmallest chip of the Pequod out of sight."

A sky-hawk that\ntauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home\namong the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;\nthis bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between\nthe hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial\nthrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his\nhammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic\nshrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive\nform folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like\nSatan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of\nheaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen\nwhite surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the\ngreat shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.Epilogue“AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE” Job.The drama’s done.

So,\nfloating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,\nwhen the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but\nslowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had\nsubsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting\ntowards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly\nwheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that\nvital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by\nreason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising\nwith great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,\nfell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost\none whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main.
