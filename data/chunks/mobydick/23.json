But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen\naccounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on\nand on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;\nwhile from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was\ndimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably\nmisnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were\nfixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some\nwhaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine\nfeet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and\nsome few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you\nnow saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,\nhalf-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.“Hast seen the White Whale?”“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with\nhis trumpet he pointed to the wreck.“Hast killed him?”“The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the\nother, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose\ngathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together."

Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these\nbarbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the\nfin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”“Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the\nhammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only\nyesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest\nwere buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning\nto his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and\nlift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with\nuplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the\nsound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not\nso quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have\nsprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy\nhanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake.\n“In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your\ntaffrail to show us your coffin!”CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were\nhardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was\ntransparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and\nman-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s\nchest in his sleep.Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\nunspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;\nbut to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed\nmighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,\ntroubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and\nshadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,\nthat distinguished them."

And at the\ngirdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen\nhere at the equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving\nalarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm\nand unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the\nashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the\nmorn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s\nforehead of heaven.Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged\ncreatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how\noblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen\nlittle Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around\ntheir old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on\nthe marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side\nand watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the\nmore and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the\nlovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a\nmoment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that\nwinsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world,\nso long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn\nneck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that\nhowever wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save\nand to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into\nthe sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee\ndrop.Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;\nand he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing\nthat stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to\ntouch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood\nthere.Ahab turned.“Starbuck!”“Sir.”"

Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago! Forty\nyears of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and\nstorm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab\nforsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors\nof the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not\nspent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the\ndesolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a\nCaptain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any\nsympathy from the green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness!\nGuinea-coast slavery of solitary command!—when I think of all this;\nonly half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before—and how for forty\nyears I have fed upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of the dry nourishment\nof my soil!—when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily\nhand, and broken the world’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away,\nwhole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and\nsailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage\npillow—wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I\nwidowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the\nmadness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with\nwhich, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly\nchased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what a forty years’\nfool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase?\nwhy weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?\nhow the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not\nhard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been\nsnatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,\nthat I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some\nashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel\ndeadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering\nbeneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack my\nheart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey\nhairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus\nintolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a\nhuman eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to\ngaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is\nthe magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;\nstay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives\nchase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with\nthe far away home I see in that eye!”"

Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter\nthe course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl\non our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some\nsuch mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.”“They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the\nmorning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy\nvivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of\ncannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back\nto dance him again.”“’Tis my Mary, my Mary herself!

Sleeping? Aye, toil we\nhow we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust\namid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in the\nhalf-cut swaths—Starbuck!”But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at\ntwo reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly\nleaning over the same rail.CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at\nintervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went\nto his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing\nup the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some\nbarbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that\npeculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living\nsperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner\nsurprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,\nand then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as\npossible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship’s course to be slightly\naltered, and the sail to be shortened.The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated\nat daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and\nlengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery\nwrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift\ntide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.“Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle\ndeck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they\nseemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear\nwith their clothes in their hands.“What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.“Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.“T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”"

A hump like a snow-hill! It is\nMoby Dick!”Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\nlook-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\nwhale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\nperch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\nbeneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s\nhead was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale\nwas now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing\nhis high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into\nthe air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they\nhad so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.“And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men\nall around him.“I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\ncried out,” said Tashtego.“Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\nreserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised\nthe White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she\nblows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,\nmethodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale’s\nvisible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down\ntop-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay\non board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;\nsteady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All\nready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;\nlower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.“He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from\nus; cannot have seen the ship yet.”“Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!\nShiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”"

  "content": "Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails\nset—all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\nleeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\nFedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\nbut only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\nstill more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\nnoon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter\ncame so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling\nhump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated\nthing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,\ngreenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly\nprojecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\nwaters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\nforehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and\nbehind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\nvalley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\ndanced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of\nhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their\nfitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull\nof an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected\nfrom the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\nsoft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\nthe fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail\nfeathers streaming like pennons.A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\nthe gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\nravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\neyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\nrippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\ngreat majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\ndivinely swam."

  "content": "On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once\nleaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale\nshed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\nnamelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\nto assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\ntornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\nwho for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\nthou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\nwaves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\nDick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\nsubmerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\nBut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an\ninstant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s\nNatural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,\nthe grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\nHoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\nthe three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.“An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed\nbeyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\nvacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\nwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze\nnow freshened; the sea began to swell.“The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego."

  "content": "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now\nall flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began\nfluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\nexpectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could\ndiscover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\ninto its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\nwhite weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\nrose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\ncrooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;\nhis vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\nThe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\ntomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\nthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\nFedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\nseizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\nstand by to stern.Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\nits bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet\nunder water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\nmalicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\nhimself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\nlengthwise beneath the boat.Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\nan instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a\nbiting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\nmouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\nthe open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\npearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s\nhead, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\nnow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\nunastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the\nuttermost stern."

  "content": "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\nwhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\nbody being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\nthe bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while\nthe other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\nimpossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\nthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\nhelpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\nthe long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\nits gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\nfrail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in\ntwain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the\ntwo floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the\ncrew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold\nfast to the oars to lash them across.At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\nto perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\nmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\nslipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as\nit slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him\nout of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the\nsea.Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\ndistance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\nbillows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\nso that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet\nout of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\ndazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\nstill higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\nbillows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\noverleap its summit with their scud.*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\ndesignation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\nup-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\npitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best\nand most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him."

The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the\nblood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the\nbook of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the\nwhale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he\ncould still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\nhelpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\nchance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\ndrifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\nlook to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s\naspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\nboats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\nthe eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\ncase could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,\nthey remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had\nnow become the old man’s head.Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s\nmast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\nand was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on\nthe”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\nwhelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\nto rise on a towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him\noff!”The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\nshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly\nswam off, the boats flew to the rescue.Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\nbrine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a\ntime, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden\nunder foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from\nhim, as desolate sounds from out ravines.But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\nabbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense\nto one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\nthrough feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\nin each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\naggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\nintensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\ncontain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\none bended arm—“is it safe?”“Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are\nfive men.”"

So, so, I see him! there!\nthere! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!\nThe eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;\nthe helm!”It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\nup by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is\nthus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.\nBut the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the\nwhale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with\na velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these\ncircumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely\nprolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long\na period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,\nthen, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate\nmeans of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,\nand were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked\nboat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything\nto her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways\noutstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an\nalbatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At\nthe well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was\nregularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\nreported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing\nthe deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\nallotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now?\nD’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded\nthem to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now\naloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks."

At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded\nsky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old\nman’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to\nevince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in\nhis Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The\nthistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”“What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did\nI not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could\nswear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a\nwreck.”“Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen,\nand an ill one.”“Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to\nman, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and\ngive an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles\nof one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye\ntwo are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the\npeopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How\nnow? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he\nspout ten times a second!”The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.\nSoon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.“Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.“How heading when last seen?”“As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”"

For such is\nthe wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible\nconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket\ncommanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last\ndescried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty\naccurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to\nswim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of\nprogression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a\npilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he\nwell knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at\nsome further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes\nthe precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more\ncertainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be\nvisited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for\nafter being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of\ndaylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’s future\nwake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious\nmind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this\nhunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in\nwater, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the\nsteadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\nis so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\nhands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly\nsay of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a\nspot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions\nwhen these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so\nmany hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have\nabout reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to\nrender this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the\nsea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what present avail to the\nbecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\nexactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable\nfrom these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the\nchase of whales."

The frenzies\nof the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\nworked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\nhave felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\ngrowing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\nas timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\nof Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the\nprevious day; the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed,\nunfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\ntowards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\nalong.

For as the one ship that held them all;\nthough it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,\nand pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each\nother in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\nand directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\nof the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\nall varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\nfatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\nhand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\nyards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\ntheir fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\nseek out the thing that might destroy them!“Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after\nthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\n“Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd\njet that way, and then disappears.”It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\nother thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\nhardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\npin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\nair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\nhalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship\nthan the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick\nbodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\nby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the\nWhite Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\nphenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\nfurthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\npure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows\nhis place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,\nthe torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,\nthis breaching is his act of defiance."

So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\nfor the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\nintensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.“Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour\nand thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\nfore. The boats!—stand by!”Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\nshooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\nhalyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\nfrom his perch.“Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,\nrigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep\naway from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\nthree crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\nthem he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up\nto his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\nsuch a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong\nvision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\nboats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\nchurning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\nrushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\nappalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\nfrom every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\nof which those boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly\nwheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\neluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the\ntime, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds."

Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\nline: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping\nthat way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage\nthan the embattled teeth of sharks!Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\nand lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\nand dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one\nthing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\nwithin—through—and then, without—the rays of steel; dragged in the line\nbeyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering\nthe rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\nthe sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so\ndoing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask\ntowards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\nsurf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a\nboiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\nthe wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\nstirred bowl of punch.While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\nthe revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\naslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\nhis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was\nlustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old\nman’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\nrescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\nconcreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\nHeaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\nfrom the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\nbottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\nagain—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\nit, like seals from a sea-side cave."

But soon, as if satisfied that his work\nfor that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\nocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\nleeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\ncame bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\nfloating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\nand safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,\nand ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\ninextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these\nwere there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen\nany one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly\nclinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy\nfloat; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\ninstead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\nStarbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\nleg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.“Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he\nwill; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I\nput good work into that leg.”“But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.“Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a\nbroken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\nmine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,\nnor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and\ninaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape\nyonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”“Dead to leeward, sir.”“Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of\nthe spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s\ncrews.”“Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”“Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!
