  "content": "It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,\nwhile three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of\nwhales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and\nwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head\nof Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to\nleeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been\ninstantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this\nfourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in\nfastening—at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell\nanything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;\nand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing\nmore; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have\nindefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was\nsome apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals\nwere placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her\nthree far to windward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the\nprecisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been necessitated to\nleave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to\nincrease her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last\nsafe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail—after the\nmissing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every\nother man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a\nsufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when\nlast seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all\naround her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again\npaused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing\ntill daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been\nseen.The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his\nobject in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his\nown in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\napart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.“I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one\nin that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his\nwatch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two\npious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height\nof the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks—pale in\nthe very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been\nthe—”“My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I\nconjure”—here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had\nbut icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me\ncharter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if\nthere be no other way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you\nmust, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.”“His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the\ncoat and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”“He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx\nsailor standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”"

  "content": "Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s\nthe more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the\nCaptain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among\nthe number of the other boat’s crews, at the same time, but on the\nother hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the\nchase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the\nwretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;\nwhich was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively\nadopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,\nthat is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to\npick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown\nconstitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\ntill forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet\nmissing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\nearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had\nthus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\nvocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\ntender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage\nin some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a\nwhaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a\nfather’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and\nconcern.Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;\nand Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without\nthe least quivering of his own.“I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say _aye_ to me. Do to me\nas you would have me do to you in the like case. For _you_ too have a\nboy, Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a\nchild of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men,\nnow, and stand by to square in the yards.”“Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that\nprolongingly moulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.\nEven now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I\nforgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle\nwatch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all\nstrangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.”Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,\nleaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter\nrejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,\nGardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his\nboat, and returned to his ship.Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\nwas in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\nhowever small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung\nround; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat\nagainst a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the\nwhile, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three\ntall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly\nsaw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without\ncomfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were\nnot.CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.(_Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow._)"

The Hat.And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a\npreliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have\nchased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;\nnow, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude\nwhere his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had\nbeen spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered\nMoby Dick;—and now that all his successive meetings with various ships\ncontrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which\nthe white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;\nnow it was that there lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which\nit was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting\npolar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months’ night\nsustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now\nfixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It\ndomineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,\nfears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a\nsingle spear or leaf.In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\nvanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more\nstrove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\nground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped\nmortar of Ahab’s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the\ndeck, ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was on them."

And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by\nnight, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go\nbelow. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan\nbut wondrous eyes did plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the\ndeck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,\nor exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the\nmain-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the\ncabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;\nhis hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he\nstood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung\nin his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never\ntell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\ntimes; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,\nthough he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and\nthe unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved\ncoat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day’s\nsunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;\nhe went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin\nthat thing he sent for."

But\nthough his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the\nParsee’s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these\ntwo never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals\nsome passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent\nspell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck\ncrew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak\none word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the\nslightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a\nsingle hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his\nscuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each\nother; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the\nParsee his abandoned substance.And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\nand every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab\nseemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both\nseemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean\nshade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and\nkeel was solid Ahab.At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard\nfrom aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till after\nsunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking\nof the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\nchildren-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac\nold man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly\nall except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether\nStubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But\nif these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from\nverbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them."

Ahab\nmust have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of\nbasketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\nblock, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\ndownward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin\nfor the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with\nthat end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round\nupon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long\nupon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then\nsettling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the\nrope, sir—I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his\nperson in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his\nperch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and\nafterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the\nroyal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead,\nastern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded\nat so great a height.When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\nthe rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is\nhoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these\ncircumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict\ncharge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such\na wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations\naloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at\nthe deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few\nminutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural\nfatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor\nshould by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all\nswooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not\nunusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,\nalmost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with\nanything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those\ntoo, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt\nsomewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select\nfor his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise\ndistrusted person’s hands.Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\nminutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\nincommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\nlatitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\nhead in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a\nthousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and\nwent eddying again round his head.But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\nnot to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked\nit much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least\nheedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every\nsight."

But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen\naccounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on\nand on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;\nwhile from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was\ndimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably\nmisnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were\nfixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some\nwhaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine\nfeet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and\nsome few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you\nnow saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,\nhalf-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.“Hast seen the White Whale?”“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with\nhis trumpet he pointed to the wreck.“Hast killed him?”“The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the\nother, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose\ngathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together."

Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these\nbarbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the\nfin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”“Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the\nhammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only\nyesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest\nwere buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning\nto his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and\nlift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with\nuplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the\nsound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not\nso quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have\nsprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy\nhanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake.\n“In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your\ntaffrail to show us your coffin!”CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were\nhardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was\ntransparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and\nman-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s\nchest in his sleep.Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\nunspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;\nbut to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed\nmighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,\ntroubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and\nshadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,\nthat distinguished them."

But so have I seen\nlittle Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around\ntheir old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on\nthe marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side\nand watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the\nmore and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the\nlovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a\nmoment, the cankerous thing in his soul.

From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into\nthe sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee\ndrop.Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;\nand he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing\nthat stole out of the centre of the serenity around.

Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this\narm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy\nin heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible\npower; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain\nthink thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does\nthat living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round\nin this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all\nthe time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon\nAlbicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where\ndo murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged\nto the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and\nthe air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have\nbeen making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and\nthe mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we\nhow we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust\namid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in the\nhalf-cut swaths—Starbuck!”But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at\ntwo reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly\nleaning over the same rail.CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at\nintervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went\nto his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing\nup the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some\nbarbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that\npeculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living\nsperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner\nsurprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,\nand then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as\npossible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship’s course to be slightly\naltered, and the sail to be shortened.The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated\nat daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and\nlengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery\nwrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift\ntide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.“Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle\ndeck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they\nseemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear\nwith their clothes in their hands.“What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.“Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.“T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”"

A hump like a snow-hill! It is\nMoby Dick!”Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\nlook-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\nwhale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\nperch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\nbeneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s\nhead was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale\nwas now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing\nhis high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into\nthe air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they\nhad so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.“And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men\nall around him.“I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\ncried out,” said Tashtego.“Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\nreserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised\nthe White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she\nblows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,\nmethodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale’s\nvisible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down\ntop-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay\non board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;\nsteady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All\nready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;\nlower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.“He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from\nus; cannot have seen the ship yet.”“Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!\nShiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”"

  "content": "Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails\nset—all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\nleeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\nFedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\nbut only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\nstill more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\nnoon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter\ncame so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling\nhump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated\nthing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,\ngreenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly\nprojecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\nwaters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\nforehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and\nbehind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\nvalley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\ndanced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of\nhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their\nfitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull\nof an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected\nfrom the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\nsoft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\nthe fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail\nfeathers streaming like pennons.A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\nthe gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\nravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\neyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\nrippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\ngreat majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\ndivinely swam."

  "content": "On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once\nleaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale\nshed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\nnamelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\nto assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\ntornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\nwho for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\nthou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\nwaves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\nDick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\nsubmerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\nBut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an\ninstant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s\nNatural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,\nthe grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\nHoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\nthe three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.“An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed\nbeyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\nvacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\nwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze\nnow freshened; the sea began to swell.“The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego."

  "content": "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now\nall flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began\nfluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\nexpectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could\ndiscover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\ninto its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\nwhite weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\nrose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\ncrooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;\nhis vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\nThe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\ntomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\nthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\nFedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\nseizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\nstand by to stern.Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\nits bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet\nunder water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\nmalicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\nhimself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\nlengthwise beneath the boat.Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\nan instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a\nbiting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\nmouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\nthe open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\npearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s\nhead, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\nnow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\nunastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the\nuttermost stern."

  "content": "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\nwhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\nbody being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\nthe bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while\nthe other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\nimpossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\nthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\nhelpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\nthe long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\nits gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\nfrail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in\ntwain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the\ntwo floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the\ncrew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold\nfast to the oars to lash them across.At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\nto perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\nmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\nslipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as\nit slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him\nout of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the\nsea.Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\ndistance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\nbillows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\nso that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet\nout of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\ndazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\nstill higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\nbillows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\noverleap its summit with their scud.*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\ndesignation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\nup-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\npitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best\nand most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him."

  "content": "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\nand round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\nwake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly\nassault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the\nblood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the\nbook of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the\nwhale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he\ncould still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\nhelpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\nchance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\ndrifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\nlook to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s\naspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\nboats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\nthe eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\ncase could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,\nthey remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had\nnow become the old man’s head.Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s\nmast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\nand was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on\nthe”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\nwhelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\nto rise on a towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him\noff!”The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\nshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly\nswam off, the boats flew to the rescue.Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\nbrine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a\ntime, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden\nunder foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from\nhim, as desolate sounds from out ravines.But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\nabbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense\nto one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\nthrough feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\nin each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\naggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\nintensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\ncontain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\none bended arm—“is it safe?”“Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are\nfive men.”"

So, so, I see him! there!\nthere! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!\nThe eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;\nthe helm!”It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\nup by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is\nthus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.\nBut the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the\nwhale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with\na velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these\ncircumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely\nprolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long\na period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,\nthen, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate\nmeans of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,\nand were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked\nboat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything\nto her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways\noutstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an\nalbatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At\nthe well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was\nregularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\nreported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing\nthe deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\nallotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now?\nD’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded\nthem to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now\naloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks."
