But\nI may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that\nis to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total\nabstinence man; I never drink—”“Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to\nhim; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with\nthe arm story.”“Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing,\nsir, before Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that spite of my\nbest and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;\nthe truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;\nmore than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead\nline. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it\ncame. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is\nagainst all rule”—pointing at it with the marlingspike—“that is the\ncaptain’s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had\nthat club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one’s brains out\nwith, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical\npassions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and\nbrushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,\nbut which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever\nhaving been a wound—“Well, the captain there will tell you how that\ncame here; he knows.”“No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with\nit. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another\nBunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in\npickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”“What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been\nimpatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.“Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we\ndidn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\ndidn’t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\ntill some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about\nMoby Dick—as some call him—and then I knew it was he.”"

And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’t bite so much as he\nswallows.”“Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to\nget the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically\nbowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that the\ndigestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine\nProvidence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest\neven a man’s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the\nWhite Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to\nswallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But\nsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of\nmine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a\ntime let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a\ntwelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in\nsmall tacks, d’ye see. No possible way for him to digest that\njack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.\nYes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind\nto pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial\nto the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale\nhave another chance at you shortly, that’s all.”“No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to the\narm he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but not to\nanother one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once,\nand that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I\nknow that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark\nye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the\nivory leg."

How long since thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”“Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly\nwalking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s\nblood—bring the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes\nthese planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing\nnear to Ahab’s arm.“Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat!\nWhich way heading?”“Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.\n“What’s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain\ncrazy?” whispering Fedallah.But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to\ntake the boat’s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle\ntowards him, commanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.In a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla men\nwere springing to their oars.

  "content": "Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she\nhailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,\nmerchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of\nEnderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not\nfar behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point\nof real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord\n1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out\nthe first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;\nthough for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant\nCoffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets\npursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not\nelsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were\nthe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm\nWhale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the\nwhole globe who so harpooned him.In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\nHorn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any\nsort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;\nand returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,\nthe Amelia’s example was soon followed by other ships, English and\nAmerican, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were\nthrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable\nhouse again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their\nmother only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I\nthink, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the\nsloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South\nSea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling\nvoyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this\nis not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship\nof their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.\nThat ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and\nit was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\ngenerally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a\nCaptain Coffin, a Nantucketer.All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to\nthe present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago\nhave slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world."

  "content": "The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast\nsailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight\nsomewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\nforecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every\nsoul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine\ngam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his\nivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that\nship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever\nlose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it\nat the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s\nsqually off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were\ncalled to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each\nother aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our\njackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the\nhowling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts\ndid not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that\nwe had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting\ndown the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to\nmy taste.The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was\nbull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\ncertain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\nsymmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that\nyou could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were\nswallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their\npitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be\nhelped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread\ncontained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very\nlight, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you\nate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the\ndimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment\nboilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of\ngood fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and\ncapital from boot heels to hat-band.But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other\nEnglish whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable\nships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the\njoke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I\nwill tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is\nmatter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of\nhistorical whale research, when it has seemed needed."

  "content": "The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\nZealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant\nin the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching\nplenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English\nmerchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence,\nin the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and\nnatural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some\nspecial origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\nelucidated.During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\nancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew\nmust be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I\nconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\ncooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was\nreinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\n“Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,\nprofessor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus\nand St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a\nbox of sperm candles for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as\nhe spied the book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The\nCooper,” but “The Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low\nDutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other\nsubjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.\nAnd in this chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a\nlong detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180\nsail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead,\nI transcribe the following:400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock\nfish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins\nof butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese\n(probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of\nbeer.Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in\nthe present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole\npipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer."

  "content": "At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this\nbeer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\nincidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic\napplication; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my\nown, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by\nevery Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen\nwhale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\nLeyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\nnaturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\nnature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\nin those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux\ncountry where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of\ntrain oil.The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\npolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\nclimate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\nincluding the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not\nmuch exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their\nfleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I\nsay, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’\nallowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.\nNow, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might\nfancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a\nboat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\nsomewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\nthis was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with\nthe constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would\nbe apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his\nboat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of\ntwo or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English\nwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when\ncruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the\nworld, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the\ndecanter.CHAPTER 102.

  "content": "Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly\ndwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail\nupon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough\nsweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still\nfurther, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,\nand casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost\nbones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his\nunconditional skeleton.But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the\nfishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\nwhale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures\non the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a\nspecimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a\nfull-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a\nroast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,\nIshmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;\nthe privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,\nridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of\nleviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and\ncheeseries in his bowels.I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far\nbeneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed\nwith an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged\nto, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his\npoke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the\nheads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my\nboat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the\ncontents of that young cub?And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their\ngigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted\nto my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.\nFor being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey\nof Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with\nthe lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side\nglen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his\ncapital."

When the vast body had at last been stripped of\nits fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,\nthen the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where\na grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with\nArsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests\nkept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again\nsent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the\nterrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung\nsword that so affrighted Damocles."

The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;\nthe trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the\nindustrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous\ncarpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and\nwoof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their\nladen branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the\nmessage-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the\nlacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving\nthe unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one\nword!—whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all\nthese ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single\nword with thee! Nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the\nloom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god,\nhe weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal\nvoice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;\nand only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak\nthrough it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken\nwords that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words\nare plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened\ncasements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be\nheedful; for so, in all this din of the great world’s loom, thy\nsubtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the\ngreat, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet,\nas the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around\nhim, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over\nwith the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but\nhimself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim\ngod wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the\nskull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real\njet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an\nobject of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests\nshould swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced\nbefore this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and\nwith a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many\nwinding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and\nfollowing it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no\nliving thing within; naught was there but bones.Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the\nskeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me\ntaking the altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st\nthou measure this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long\ndo ye make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,\nconcerning feet and inches; they cracked each other’s sconces with\ntheir yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance,\nI quickly concluded my own admeasurements."

  "content": "These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it\nrecorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\nmeasurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can\nrefer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell\nme, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where\nthey have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise,\nI have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they\nhave what the proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a\nGreenland or River Whale in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in\nYorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford\nConstable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of\nmoderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend\nKing Tranquo’s.In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons\nbelonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar\ngrounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir\nClifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir\nClifford’s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great\nchest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony\ncavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon\nhis lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and\nshutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of\nkeys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep\nat the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the\necho in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled\nview from his forehead.The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied\nverbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild\nwanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving\nsuch valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished\nthe other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then\ncomposing—at least, what untattooed parts might remain—I did not\ntrouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all\nenter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale’s Skeleton.In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain\nstatement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton\nwe are briefly to exhibit.

  "content": "According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\nupon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized\nGreenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\ncalculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\neighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\nfeet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\nninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\nconsiderably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\nthousand one hundred inhabitants.Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to\nthis leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\njaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\nsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\nunobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a\nproportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\nmost complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it\nin this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under\nyour arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion\nof the general structure we are about to view.In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\nfeet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\nbeen ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\nfifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two\nfeet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty\nfeet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less\nthan a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs\nwhich once enclosed his vitals.To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\nextending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\nthe hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\ntwenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\nfor the time, but a long, disconnected timber."

The first, to begin from the neck, was\nnearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\nsuccessively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\nof the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\nthat part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\nspanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\na seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\narched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\nfootpath bridges over small streams.In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\nthe whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\nthe Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the\nfish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of\nthe invested body of this particular whale must have been at least\nsixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more\nthan eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion\nof the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I\nnow saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with\ntons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for\nthe ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of\nthe weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\nto comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his\ndead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in\nthe heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his\nangry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully\ninvested whale be truly and livingly found out.But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\ncrane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\nit’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar."

They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a\nGothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a\nmiddle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\nmore than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\ntail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\nbilliard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\nhad been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’s children,\nwho had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\nspine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\nsimple child’s play.CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\nto enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not\ncompress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial\nfolio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and\nthe yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic\ninvolutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables\nand hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a\nline-of-battle-ship.Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to\napprove myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not\noverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him\nout to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him\nin most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now\nremains to magnify him in an archæological, fossiliferous, and\nantediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the\nLeviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed\nunwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case\nis altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest\nwords of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been\nconvenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have\ninvariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased\nfor that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s uncommon personal\nbulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author\nlike me."

Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard\ncapitals. Give me a condor’s quill! Give me Vesuvius’ crater for an\ninkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my\nthoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their\noutreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole\ncircle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and\nmastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas\nof empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding\nits suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and\nliberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you\nmust choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be\nwritten on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my\ncredentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I\nhave been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and\nwells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by\nway of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the\nearlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now\nalmost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are\ncalled the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate\nintercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose\nremote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil\nWhales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the\nlast preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them\nprecisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet\nsufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking\nrank as Cetacean fossils.Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones\nand skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,\nbeen found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England,\nin Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\nAmong the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the\nyear 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street\nopening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones\ndisinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s\ntime. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some\nutterly unknown Leviathanic species."

  "content": "But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost\ncomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,\non the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken\ncredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the\nfallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and\nbestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of\nit being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned\nout that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed\nspecies. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again\nrepeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but\nlittle clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen\nrechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the\nLondon Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most\nextraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted\nout of existence.When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,\njaws, ribs, and vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to\nthe existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on\nthe other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical\nLeviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to\nthat wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for\ntime began with man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I\nobtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when\nwedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and\nin all the 25,000 miles of this world’s circumference, not an\ninhabitable hand’s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world\nwas the whale’s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the\npresent lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree\nlike Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s.\nMethuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I\nam horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the\nunspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,\nmust needs exist after all humane ages are over.But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the\nstereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his\nancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim\nfor them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable\nprint of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some\nfifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a\nsculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,\nand dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe\nof the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was\nthere swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was\ncradled."

  "content": "Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity\nof the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by\nthe venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.“Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams\nof which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are\noftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine,\nthat by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can\npass it without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that\non either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into\nthe Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon ’em. They keep a\nWhale’s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the\nGround with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which\ncannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John\nLeo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their\nHistorians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from\nthis Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas\nwas cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.”In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a\nNantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale’s Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from\nthe head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,\nin the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the\noriginal bulk of his sires.But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the\npresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are\nfound in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period\nprior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those\nbelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier\nones."

  "content": "Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the\nAlabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than\nseventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,\nthat the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a\nlarge sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen’s authority,\nthat Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the\ntime of capture.But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an\nadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may\nit not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated?Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of\nsuch gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For\nPliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and\nAldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length—Rope\nWalks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and\nSolander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy\nof Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or\nWrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three\nhundred and sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his\nelaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page\n3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and\ntwenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is\nas big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny\nis, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.\nBecause I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies\nthat were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not\nmeasure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;\nand while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest\nEgyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they\nare drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize\ncattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the\nfattest of Pharaoh’s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not\nadmit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated."

  "content": "But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\nrecondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient\nlook-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even\nthrough Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and\nlockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along\nall continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long\nendure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not\nat last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the\nlast man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final\npuff.Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,\nwhich, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the\nprairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and\nscowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous\nriver-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar\nan inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem\nfurnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy\nextinction.But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a\nperiod ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois\nexceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day\nnot one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the\ncause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far\ndifferent nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious\nan end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales\nfor forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank\nGod, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the\ndays of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West,\nwhen the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness\nand a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of\nmonths, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain\nnot forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need\nwere, could be statistically stated."

  "content": "Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the\ngradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former\nyears (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in\nsmall pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in\nconsequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more\nremunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,\ninfluenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense\ncaravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,\nand pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but\nwidely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally\nfallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone\nwhales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with\nthem, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being\ndriven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened\nwith their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been\nvery recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two\nfirm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain\nimpregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty\nSwiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas\nand glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort\nto their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers\nand walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed\ncircle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one\ncachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this\npositive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.\nBut though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than\n13,000, have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the\nAmericans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this\ncircumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this\nmatter.Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness\nof the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to\nHarto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the\nKing of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are\nnumerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems\nno reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted\nfor thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all\nthe successive monarchs of the East—if they still survive there in\ngreat numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since\nhe has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as\nall Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the\nIsles of the sea combined."
