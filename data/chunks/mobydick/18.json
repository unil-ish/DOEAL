  "content": "Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s\naccursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of\ndeserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,\nwhich is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this\nearth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow\nin him, that mortal man cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With\nbooks the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the\ntruest of all books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered\nsteel of woe. “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold\nof unchristian Solomon’s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and\njails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of\noperas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils\nall of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais\nas passing wise, and therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit\ndown on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably\nwondrous Solomon.But even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of\nunderstanding shall remain” (_i.e._, even while living) “in the\ncongregation of the dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it\ninvert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom\nthat is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a\nCatskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest\ngorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny\nspaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is\nin the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle\nis still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s\nforecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single\nmoment you would have almost thought you were standing in some\nilluminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay\nin their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a\nscore of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of\nqueens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in\ndarkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he\nseeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an\nAladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night\nthe ship’s black hull still houses an illumination."

  "content": "See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of\nlamps—often but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at\nthe try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He\nburns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,\nunvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral\ncontrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He\ngoes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and\ngenuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own\nsupper of game.CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\ndescried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,\nand slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed\nalongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the\nheadsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his\ngreat padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in\ndue time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and\nAbednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the\nfire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of\nthe description by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding\nof decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the\nhold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,\nsliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to\nrise and blow.While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the\nsix-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling\nthis way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed\nround and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot\nacross the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last\nman-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,\nrap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,\nevery sailor is a cooper.At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the\ngreat hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,\nand down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the\nhatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up."

  "content": "In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\nincidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream\nwith freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous\nmasses of the whale’s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie\nabout, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted\nall the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the\nentire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din\nis deafening.But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\nself-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,\nyou would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a\nmost scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil\npossesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the\ndecks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of\noil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a\npotent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back\nof the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly\nexterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with\nbuckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot\nis brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which\nhave been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The\ngreat hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely\nhiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in\nunseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of\nalmost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty\nis at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own\nablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the\nimmaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from\nout the daintiest Holland.Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and\nhumorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;\npropose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not\nto taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to\nsuch musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short\nof audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and\nbring us napkins!"

Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest\nuninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through\nfor ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their\nwrists with all day rowing on the Line,—they only step to the deck to\ncarry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash,\nyea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the\ncombined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works;\nwhen, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves\nto cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the\ntime the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks,\nare startled by the cry of “There she blows!” and away they fly to\nfight another whale, and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my\nfriends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we\nmortals by long toilings extracted from this world’s vast bulk its\nsmall but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed\nourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean\ntabernacles of the soul; hardly is this done, when—_There she\nblows!_—the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other\nworld, and go through young life’s old routine again.Oh! the metempsychosis!

The Doubloon.Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,\ntaking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in\nthe multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been\nadded how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,\nhe was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely\neyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the\nbinnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the\ncompass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of\nhis purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\nmainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted\ngold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only\ndashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly\nattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as\nthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in\nsome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some\ncertain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little\nworth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell\nby the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass\nin the Milky Way."

  "content": "Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of\nthe heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,\nthe head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst\nall the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,\nyet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its\nQuito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour\npassed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with\nthick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless\nevery sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it\nwas set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however\nwanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as\nthe white whale’s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary\nwatch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he\nwould ever live to spend it.Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun\nand tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s\ndisks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,\nare in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems\nalmost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by\npassing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy\nexample of these things. On its round border it bore the letters,\nREPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country\nplanted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and\nnamed after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the\nunwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the\nlikeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;\non the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of\nthe partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual\ncabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at\nLibra.Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now\npausing."

If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;\nbut if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to\ncheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we\nwould fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!\nThis coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me.

Trumpet to mouth, the old man was\nstanding in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to\nthe stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s\nbow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of\nsixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round\nhim in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket\nstreamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.“Hast seen the White Whale?”“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,\nhe held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden\nhead like a mallet.“Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near\nhim—“Stand by to lower!”In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\ncrew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\nstranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the\nexcitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his\nleg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his\nown, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical\ncontrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and\nshipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very\neasy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,\nlike whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;\nfor the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,\nand then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,\ndeprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether\nunsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly\nreduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain\nchangeful height he could hardly hope to attain."

And\nin the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\ntwo officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\npair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\nto bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\nuse their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\nbecause the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\ncried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\nover the cutting-tackle.”As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\ncurved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.\nThis was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,\nslid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting\nin the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then\ngiving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to\nhoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running\nparts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high\nbulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm\nfrankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,\nputting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two\nsword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let\nus shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can\nshrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did’st thou see\nthe White Whale?—how long ago?”“The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards\nthe East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a\ntelescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”“And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from\nthe capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.“Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”“Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”"

Presently up breaches\nfrom the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white\nhead and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.”“It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended\nbreath.“And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”“Aye, aye—they were mine—_my_ irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”“Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well,\nthis old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all\nafoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!“Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know\nhim.”"

And thinking the hap-hazard line would\nget loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a\ndevil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I\nsay, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the\nway, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped\ninto Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with\nmine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\ngreat-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls\nalive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes\nout—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail\nlooming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble\nsteeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,\nwith a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after\nthe second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima\ntower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\nflukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\nall chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I\nseized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung\nto that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at\nthe same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down\nlike a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near\nme caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,\ncaught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was\nthinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb\nript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my\narm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there\nwill tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship’s surgeon:\nBunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the\nyarn.”"

Well; after he sounded, we\ndidn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\ndidn’t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\ntill some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about\nMoby Dick—as some call him—and then I knew it was he.”"

How long, prior to the year of our Lord\n1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out\nthe first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;\nthough for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant\nCoffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets\npursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not\nelsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were\nthe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm\nWhale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the\nwhole globe who so harpooned him.In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\nHorn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any\nsort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;\nand returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,\nthe Amelia’s example was soon followed by other ships, English and\nAmerican, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were\nthrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable\nhouse again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their\nmother only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I\nthink, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the\nsloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South\nSea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling\nvoyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this\nis not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship\nof their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.\nThat ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and\nit was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\ngenerally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a\nCaptain Coffin, a Nantucketer.All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to\nthe present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago\nhave slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world."

I boarded her once at midnight\nsomewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\nforecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every\nsoul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine\ngam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his\nivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that\nship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever\nlose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it\nat the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s\nsqually off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were\ncalled to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each\nother aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our\njackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the\nhowling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts\ndid not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that\nwe had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting\ndown the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to\nmy taste.The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was\nbull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\ncertain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\nsymmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that\nyou could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were\nswallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their\npitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be\nhelped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread\ncontained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very\nlight, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you\nate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the\ndimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment\nboilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of\ngood fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and\ncapital from boot heels to hat-band.But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other\nEnglish whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable\nships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the\njoke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I\nwill tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is\nmatter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of\nhistorical whale research, when it has seemed needed."

  "content": "The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\nZealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant\nin the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching\nplenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English\nmerchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence,\nin the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and\nnatural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some\nspecial origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\nelucidated.During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\nancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew\nmust be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I\nconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\ncooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was\nreinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\n“Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,\nprofessor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus\nand St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a\nbox of sperm candles for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as\nhe spied the book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The\nCooper,” but “The Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low\nDutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other\nsubjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.\nAnd in this chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a\nlong detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180\nsail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead,\nI transcribe the following:400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock\nfish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins\nof butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese\n(probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of\nbeer.Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in\nthe present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole\npipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer."

In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\nLeyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\nnaturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\nnature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\nin those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux\ncountry where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of\ntrain oil.The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\npolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\nclimate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\nincluding the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not\nmuch exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their\nfleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I\nsay, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’\nallowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.\nNow, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might\nfancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a\nboat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\nsomewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\nthis was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with\nthe constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would\nbe apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his\nboat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of\ntwo or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English\nwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when\ncruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the\nworld, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the\ndecanter.CHAPTER 102.

How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the\nfishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\nwhale?
