  "content": "As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter\nexertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under\nindolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands\namong those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost\nwithin the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all\ntheir opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that\nuncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of spring\nviolets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky\nmeadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible\nsperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit\nthe old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in\nallaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely\nfree from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort\nwhatsoever.Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm\ntill I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a\nstrange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly\nsqueezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the\ngentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving\nfeeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually\nsqueezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as\nmuch as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish\nany social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;\nlet us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into\neach other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and\nsperm of kindness.Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since\nby many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all\ncases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of\nattainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the\nfancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the\nfireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready\nto squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I\nsaw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of\nspermaceti.Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things\nakin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the\ntry-works.First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering\npart of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It\nis tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some\noil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut\ninto portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like\nblocks of Berkshire marble."

  "content": "Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\nwhale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and\noften participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is\na most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name\nimports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked\nsnowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and\npurple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,\nit is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I\nstole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should\nconceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have\ntasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the\nvenison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an\nunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in\nthe course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling\nadequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation\noriginal with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.\nIt is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the\ntubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I\nhold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,\ncoalescing.Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but\nsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the\ndark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the\nGreenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those\ninferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s\nvocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s\nnipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering\npart of Leviathan’s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the\nrest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along\nthe oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless\nblandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities."

  "content": "But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at\nonce to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its\ninmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for\nthe blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the\nproper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a\nscene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by\na dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They\ngenerally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The\nwhaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same\nname. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the\ngaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from\nslipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the\nspade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into\nthe portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the\nspademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes\nirresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of\nhis own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you be very much\nastonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\npost-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the\nwindlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small\ncuriosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen\nthere, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous\ncistern in the whale’s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower\njaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so\nsurprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer than\na Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and\njet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it\nis; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that\nfound in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for\nworshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the\nidol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly\nset forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings."

  "content": "Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and\nassisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners\ncall it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a\ngrenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the\nforecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt,\nas an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt\ninside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as\nalmost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in\nthe rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some\nthree feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two\nslits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself\nbodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full\ncanonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this\ninvestiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the\npeculiar functions of his office.That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the\npots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,\nplanted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath\nit, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt\norator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;\nintent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a\nlad for a Pope were this mincer!**Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates\nto the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as\nthin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of\nboiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably\nincreased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly\ndistinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the\nmost solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the\ncompleted ship. It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were\ntransported to her planks."

  "content": "The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most\nroomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,\nfitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and\nmortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The\nfoundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly\nsecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all\nsides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased\nwith wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened\nhatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in\nnumber, and each of several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they\nare kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone\nand sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the\nnight-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil\nthemselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them—one\nman in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are\ncarried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound\nmathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,\nwith the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first\nindirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies\ngliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from\nany point in precisely the same time.Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare\nmasonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of\nthe furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted\nwith heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented\nfrom communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir\nextending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel\ninserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as\nfast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct\nfrom the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works were\nfirst started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee\nthe business.“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\nworks.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting\nhis shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said\nthat in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed\nfor a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of\nquick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,\nthe crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still\ncontains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed\nthe flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\nmisanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by\nhis own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is\nhorrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you\nmust live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor\nabout it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells\nlike the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the\npit."

  "content": "By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the\ncarcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean\ndarkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce\nflames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and\nilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek\nfire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to\nsome vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the\nbold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad\nsheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and\nfolded them in conflagrations.The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide\nhearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of\nthe pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge\npronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding\npots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted,\ncurling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled\naway in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of\nthe boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.\nOpposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden\nhearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the\nwatch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the\nfire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny\nfeatures, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,\nand the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were\nstrangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they\nnarrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror\ntold in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards\nout of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their\nfront, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged\nforks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the\nship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further\nand further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\nchamped the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on\nall sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden\nwith fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of\ndarkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s\nsoul."

Wrapped, for that\ninterval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the\nmadness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend\nshapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at\nlast begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to\nthat unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a\nmidnight helm.But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)\nthing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was\nhorribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller\nsmote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of\nsails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were\nopen; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and\nmechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all\nthis, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed\nbut a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle\nlamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and\nthen made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,\nthat whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to\nany haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered\nfeeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the\ntiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in\nsome enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me?\nthought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was\nfronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In\nan instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying\nup into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how\ngrateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and\nthe fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy\nhand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first\nhint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its\nredness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,\nthe skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking\nflames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the\nglorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all others but liars!"

The sun hides not the ocean,\nwhich is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this\nearth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow\nin him, that mortal man cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With\nbooks the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the\ntruest of all books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered\nsteel of woe. “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold\nof unchristian Solomon’s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and\njails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of\noperas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils\nall of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais\nas passing wise, and therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit\ndown on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably\nwondrous Solomon.But even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of\nunderstanding shall remain” (_i.e._, even while living) “in the\ncongregation of the dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it\ninvert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom\nthat is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a\nCatskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest\ngorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny\nspaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is\nin the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle\nis still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s\nforecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single\nmoment you would have almost thought you were standing in some\nilluminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay\nin their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a\nscore of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of\nqueens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in\ndarkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he\nseeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an\nAladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night\nthe ship’s black hull still houses an illumination."

He\nburns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,\nunvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral\ncontrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He\ngoes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and\ngenuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own\nsupper of game.CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\ndescried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,\nand slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed\nalongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the\nheadsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his\ngreat padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in\ndue time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and\nAbednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the\nfire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of\nthe description by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding\nof decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the\nhold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,\nsliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to\nrise and blow.While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the\nsix-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling\nthis way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed\nround and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot\nacross the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last\nman-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,\nrap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,\nevery sailor is a cooper.At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the\ngreat hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,\nand down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the\nhatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up."

  "content": "In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\nincidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream\nwith freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous\nmasses of the whale’s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie\nabout, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted\nall the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the\nentire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din\nis deafening.But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\nself-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,\nyou would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a\nmost scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil\npossesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the\ndecks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of\noil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a\npotent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back\nof the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly\nexterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with\nbuckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot\nis brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which\nhave been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The\ngreat hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely\nhiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in\nunseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of\nalmost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty\nis at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own\nablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the\nimmaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from\nout the daintiest Holland.Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and\nhumorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;\npropose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not\nto taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to\nsuch musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short\nof audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and\nbring us napkins!"

When he halted before the\nbinnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the\ncompass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of\nhis purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\nmainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted\ngold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only\ndashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly\nattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as\nthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in\nsome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some\ncertain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little\nworth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell\nby the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass\nin the Milky Way."

And though now nailed amidst\nall the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,\nyet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its\nQuito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour\npassed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with\nthick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless\nevery sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it\nwas set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however\nwanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as\nthe white whale’s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary\nwatch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he\nwould ever live to spend it.Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun\nand tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s\ndisks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,\nare in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems\nalmost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by\npassing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy\nexample of these things. On its round border it bore the letters,\nREPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country\nplanted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and\nnamed after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the\nunwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the\nlikeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;\non the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of\nthe partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual\ncabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at\nLibra.Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now\npausing."

Great pains, small gains for\nthose who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself.

So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over\nall our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a\nhope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;\nbut if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to\ncheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we\nwould fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!\nThis coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will\nquit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”"

You’ll do to give us the\nbare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That’s my\nsmall experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch’s\nnavigator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if\nthere is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders!\nThere’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it!\nLook you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round\nchapter; and now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come,\nAlmanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets\nus; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,\nor the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo!\ncomes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue,\nLeo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and\nsurly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that’s\nour first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes\nLibra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we\nare very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the\nScorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang\ncome the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing\nhimself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here’s the\nbattering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,\nand headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours\nout his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the\nFishes, we sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the\nsun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and\nhearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and\nso, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu,\nDoubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the\ntry-works, now, and let’s hear what he’ll have to say. There; he’s\nbefore it; he’ll out with something presently. So, so; he’s beginning.”"

  "content": "So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,\nbearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was\nstanding in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to\nthe stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s\nbow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of\nsixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round\nhim in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket\nstreamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.“Hast seen the White Whale?”“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,\nhe held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden\nhead like a mallet.“Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near\nhim—“Stand by to lower!”In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\ncrew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\nstranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the\nexcitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his\nleg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his\nown, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical\ncontrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and\nshipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very\neasy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,\nlike whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;\nfor the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,\nand then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,\ndeprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether\nunsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly\nreduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain\nchangeful height he could hardly hope to attain."

  "content": "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\ncircumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\nluckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\nin the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\ntwo officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\npair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\nto bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\nuse their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\nbecause the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\ncried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\nover the cutting-tackle.”As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\ncurved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.\nThis was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,\nslid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting\nin the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then\ngiving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to\nhoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running\nparts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high\nbulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm\nfrankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,\nputting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two\nsword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let\nus shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can\nshrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did’st thou see\nthe White Whale?—how long ago?”“The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards\nthe East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a\ntelescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”“And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from\nthe capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.“Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”“Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”"

Presently up breaches\nfrom the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white\nhead and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.”“It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended\nbreath.“And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”“Aye, aye—they were mine—_my_ irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”“Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well,\nthis old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all\nafoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!“Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know\nhim.”"

Seeing how matters\nstood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I\never saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the\nboiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\nget loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a\ndevil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I\nsay, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the\nway, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped\ninto Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with\nmine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\ngreat-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls\nalive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes\nout—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail\nlooming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble\nsteeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,\nwith a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after\nthe second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima\ntower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\nflukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\nall chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I\nseized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung\nto that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at\nthe same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down\nlike a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near\nme caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,\ncaught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was\nthinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb\nript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my\narm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there\nwill tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship’s surgeon:\nBunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the\nyarn.”"
