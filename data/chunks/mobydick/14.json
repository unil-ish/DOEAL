  "content": "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\nregularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we\nmay freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\ndeck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\nstudy practical cetology than here?In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\nthese heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\ncertain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right\nWhale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head.\nAs you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\nhim, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\ndignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\nsummit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\nis what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two\nmost important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\nhead, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you\nnarrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\nfancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\nmagnitude of the head.Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\nthan he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s\neyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for\nyourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\nthrough your ears. You would find that you could only command some\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\nand about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\nbehind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\nthe front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?"

  "content": "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\nthe whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\nsolid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\ntwo lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\nimpressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\nmust see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\npicture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\nnothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\nthe whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\ndistinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\nwhale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\nhint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\nis involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\nwhatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience\nwill teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\nthings at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and\ncompletely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at\none and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\nand touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\nobjects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\norder to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\nbear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\nconsciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\nthemselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\ncomprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the\nsame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\none side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\ncan, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\nsimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\nproblems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\nincongruity in this comparison.It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\nbeset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\nfrights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\nproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\ndivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them."

  "content": "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\nentire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for\nhours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\nwhatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\nwondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\nrespect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\nbetween the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\nan external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\nover with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\nworld through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\nwhich is smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens\nof Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\ncathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\nhearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?\nSubtilize it.Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\nover the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending\nby a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not\nthat the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we\nmight descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But\nlet us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What\na really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,\nlined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as\nbridal satins.But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\nlike the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one\nend, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\nand expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\nalas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\nspikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\nwhen fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\nsuspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\nstraight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\nship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\njaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\nreproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon\nhim."

  "content": "In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised\nartist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting\nthe ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone\nwith which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,\nincluding canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an\nanchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other\nwork—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,\nare set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances\nthe gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being\nrigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag\nstumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally\nforty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;\nnor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn\ninto slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right\nWhale’s head.As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a\nRoman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly\nrounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather\ninelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred\nyears ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\nshoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the\nnursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\nlodged, she and all her progeny."

  "content": "But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit\nand look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole\nhead for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in\nits sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,\ncrested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,\nbarnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the\nSouthern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes\nsolely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\nwith a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those\nlive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost\nsure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\ntechnical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\ntake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\ndiademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\nhim in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a\nvery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower\nlip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\ncarpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\nsulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.\nThe fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an\nimportant interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when\nearthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery\nthreshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at\nMackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good\nLord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet\nhigh, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular\nridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us\nwith those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,\nsay three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the\nhead or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere\nbeen cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with\nhairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in\nwhose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes\nthrough the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of\nbone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious\nmarks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\ncreature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the\ncertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the\nsavor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we\nmust grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance\nwill seem reasonable.In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\nconcerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\n“whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a\nthird old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:\n“There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\nupper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”"

  "content": "*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\nrather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\nupper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts\nimpart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\ncountenance.As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”\n“blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and\nother stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has\nlong been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was\nin its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those\nancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as\nyou may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we\nnowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a\ntent spread over the same bone.But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\nstanding in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all\nthese colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not\nthink you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its\nthousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\nTurkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the\nmouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\nit on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\nshould say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that\namount of oil.Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\nwith—that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\ndifferent heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no\ngreat well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible\nof a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are\nthere any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely\nanything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external\nspout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet\nlie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other\nwill not be very long in following."

I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like\nplacidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the\nother head’s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by\naccident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.\nDoes not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical\nresolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a\nStoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in\nhis latter years.CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you,\nas a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front\naspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you\ninvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\nunexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may\nbe lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either\nsatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an\ninfidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,\nperhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history."

  "content": "You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,\nthe front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\nwater; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\nconsiderably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long\nsocket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the\nmouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as\nthough your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you\nobserve that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\nhas—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes\nand ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire\nlength from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the\nfront of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single\norgan or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are\nnow to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part\nof the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and\nnot till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\nfull cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is\nas one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents\npartly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised\nof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that\napparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how\nthe blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.\nJust so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this\nenvelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable\nby any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the\nsharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds\nfrom it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved\nwith horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen\nchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the\nsailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming\ncontact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold\nthere a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and\ntoughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which\nwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By\nitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But\nsupplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as\nordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,\ncapable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,\nas far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the\notherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head\naltogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated\nout of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its\nenvelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has\nhypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled\nhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and\nunsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to\natmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the\nirresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and\ndestructive of all elements contributes."

So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the\nspecialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this\nexpansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more\ninconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all\nignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the\nSperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed\nthe Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your\neye-brow.

But to comprehend it aright, you must\nknow something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated\nupon.Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\ninclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower\nis the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an\nunctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the\nexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the\nforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two\nalmost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal\nwall of a thick tendinous substance.*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\nmathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\nsolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\nsteep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\nsides."

The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great\nHeidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is\nmystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms\ninnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\nwondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished\nwith the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun\nof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily\nvintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,\nlimpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found\nunalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains\nperfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon\nbegins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when\nthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale’s\ncase generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from\nunavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and\ndribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish\nbusiness of securing what you can.I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was\ncoated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not\npossibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like\nthe lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm\nWhale’s case.It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\nembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as\nhas been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole\nlength of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet\nfor a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the\ndepth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a\nship’s side.As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\nspermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest\na careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly\nlet out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the\nhead, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in\nthat position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen\ncombinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\nquarter.Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in\nthis particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm\nWhale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.CHAPTER 78.

He has carried\nwith him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\ntravelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\nit hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\nis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\nthe other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he\nlands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated above the\nrest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish\nMuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\nshort-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches\nfor the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business\nhe proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\nsounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\nthis cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like\na well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\nIndian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\nbucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word\nto the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like\na dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the\nfull-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\nemptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through\nthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\nend, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper\nand deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone\ndown."

Meantime, there\nwas a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before\nlifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,\nas if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only\nthe poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\ndepth to which he had sunk."

The one remaining hook,\nupon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\non the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent\nmotions of the head.“Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand\nholding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he\nwould still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,\nrammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the\nburied harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.“In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge\nthere?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on\ntop of his head? Avast, will ye!”“Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a\nrocket.Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\ndropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the\nsuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering\ncopper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the\nsailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of\nspray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,\nburied-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the\nsea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked\nfigure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\nhovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my\nbrave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the\nside, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\nand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\nnow jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the\nship.“Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\noverhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust\nupright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust\nforth from the grass over a grave."

Drawn into the\nwaiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\nlong in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\nslowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side\nlunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\ndropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\nand so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\nthrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\nwas not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had\nthrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\nsomerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\nthe good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\ndoing as well as could be expected.And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\nQueequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\nsuccessfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and\napparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\nforgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\nand boxing, riding and rowing.I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to\nseem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have\neither seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an\naccident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than\nthe Indian’s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the\nSperm Whale’s well."

  "content": "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought\nthe tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and\nmost corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of\na far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at\nall, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had\nbeen nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the\ndense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,\nas I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of\nwhich sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking\nin this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted\nby the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it\nsank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\nchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.\nYes, it was a running delivery, so it was.Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious\nperishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\nspermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber\nand sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be\nrecalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey\nin the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that\nleaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How\nmany, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and\nsweetly perished there?CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this\nLeviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has\nas yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as\nfor Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,\nor for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the\nPantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of\nthe various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of\nhorses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the\nmodifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his\ndisciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the\nphrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,\nthough I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of\nthese two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all\nthings; I achieve what I can."

  "content": "Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He\nhas no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\nits entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\nthe countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,\ncupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable\nto the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in\nkeeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the\nnose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his\nproportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the\nsculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is\nan added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As\non your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\njolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the\nreflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which\nso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\nroyal beadle on his throne.In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to\nbe had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This\naspect is sublime.In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the\nmorning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has\na touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,\nthe elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is\nas that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their\ndecrees. It signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most\ncreatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip\nof alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\nlike Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\nand all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\ntrack the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\nhigh and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\nDeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\nobject in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\ndistinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\nhe has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,\nand ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;\nthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In\nprofile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\ndepression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark\nof genius."

It is moreover declared in his\npyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale\nbeen known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by\ntheir child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,\nbecause the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,\nor at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of\nprotrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall\nlure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and\nlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now\nunhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove’s high seat, the great\nSperm Whale shall lord it.Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is\nno Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s\nface. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing\nfable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could\nnot read the simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle\nmeanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of\nthe Sperm Whale’s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you\ncan.CHAPTER 80. The Nut.If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist\nhis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to\nsquare.In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\nin length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as\nthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\nbase. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is\nangularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\nmass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to\nbed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in\nanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in\ndepth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at\nleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away\nbehind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\namplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\nsecreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\nthat the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\nof one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in\nstrange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it\nseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence."

  "content": "It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\nthe creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his\ntrue brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The\nwhale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the\ncommon world.If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\nof its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from\nthe same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down\nto the human magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would\ninvoluntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on\none part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man\nhad no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,\nconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\npower, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you\ndeem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea\nfor you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you\nwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung\nnecklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\nskull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely\nundeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the\nGermans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once\npointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with\nthe vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\nbeaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have\nomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\ncerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s\ncharacter will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel\nyour spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine\nnever yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in\nthe firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the\nworld."

  "content": "Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\ncavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\nthe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being\neight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As\nit passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but\nfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,\nthis canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the\nspinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And\nwhat is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s\ncavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal\nto that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be\nunreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically?\nFor, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his\nbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative\nmagnitude of his spinal cord.But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the\nSperm Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\nof the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\nconvex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call\nthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm\nWhale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have\nreason to know.CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,\nDerick De Deer, master, of Bremen.At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and\nGermans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide\nintervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with\ntheir flag in the Pacific.For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.\nWhile yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a\nboat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the\nbows instead of the stern.“What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something\nwavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”“Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s\ncoming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big\ntin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all\nright, is the Yarman.”“Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.\nHe’s out of oil, and has come a-begging.”However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\nwhale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old\nproverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing\nreally happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did\nindubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare."

There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their\ndanger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before\nthe wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in\nharness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling\na great wide parchment upon the sea.Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,\nhumped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as\nby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed\nafflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this\nwhale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is\nnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.\nNevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\nmust have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\ncurrents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth\nwith a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,\nfollowed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to\nhave egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind\nhim to upbubble.“Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m\nafraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse\nwinds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind\nI ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so\nbefore? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.”"
