  "content": "In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\nthere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands\nare wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no\nstaying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has\nto be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the\ndescription of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was\nmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the\nblubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\nspades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\nsame hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\nparticular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to\ndescend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.\nBut in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\nconcluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,\nexcepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\nfeet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\nhalf on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like\na tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured\nin the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at\nleast, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better\nchance to observe him, as will presently be seen.Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\nin his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\nattend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\nwhale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\na long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg\ndown there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\nmonkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\nwaist.It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\nends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\nleather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\nwere wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both\nusage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should\ndrag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature\nunited us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I\nany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\nentailed."

  "content": "So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,\nthat while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to\nperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock\ncompany of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that\nanother’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited\ndisaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\ninterregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\nso gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked\nhim now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\nto jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\nmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\nmost cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a\nplurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\napothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,\nyou may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these\nand the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I\ncame very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do\nwhat I would, I only had the management of one end of it.**The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\nthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This\nimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\nthan Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\npossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\nmonkey-rope holder.I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\nwhale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\nrolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy\nhe was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\nnight, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\npent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures\nswarmed round it like bees in a beehive.And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\naside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it\nnot that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\nmiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man."

  "content": "Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\nravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\nthem. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then\njerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\nseemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another\nprotection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and\nDaggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\nwhale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\nreach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\nbenevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but\nin their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that\nboth he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled\nwater, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a\nleg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping\nthere with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed\nto his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\nand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters\nit, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men\nin this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those\nsharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks\nand spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now,\nas with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last\nclimbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily\ntrembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,\nconsolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye\ngods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!“Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.\n“Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then\nstanding as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the\nastonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have\nthe goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of\nginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to\nkindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is\nginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what\nthe devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor\nQueequeg here.”“There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this\nbusiness,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just\ncome from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,\nif you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The\nsteward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to\nQueequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an\napothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by\nwhich he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”"

You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder\nus all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”“It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the\nginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,\nbut only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”“Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to\nthe lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.\nStarbuck. It is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a\nwhale.”“Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”“Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of\nthat sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying,\nsir?”“Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a\nsort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and\nwas handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that\nwas freely given to the waves.CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk\nover Him.It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s\nprodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it\ncontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to\nit.

  "content": "Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually\ndrifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,\ngave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the\nLeviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\nanywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of\nthose inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to\ncruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near\nthe Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had\nbeen brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the\nannouncement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,\nif opportunity offered.Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\nboats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further\nand further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at\nthe mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of\ntumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or\nboth the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in\nplain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the\ntowing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first\nit seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\nmaelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from\nview, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the\nship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being\nbrought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty\nof line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they\npaid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their\nmight so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle\nwas intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened\nline in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the\ncontending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few\nfeet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did\ngain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\nalong the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,\nsuddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken\nglass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\nmore the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,\nand blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship\ntowing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete\ncircuit."

But I sometimes think\nhe’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap,\nStubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved\ninto a snake’s head, Stubb?”“Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\ndark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look\ndown there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\nhands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in\ndisguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been\nstowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you\ndon’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries\nit coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of\nit, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”“He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve\nseen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”“No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye\nsee, in the eye of the rigging.”“What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”“Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”"

Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”“I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\none, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old\nflag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\ngentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he\nwas at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching\nhis hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old\ngovernor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting\nmad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the\nLord, Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before\nhe got through with him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look\nsharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get\nthe whale alongside.”“I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask,\nwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden\ntowards the ship, “but I can’t remember where.”“Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?\nDid ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”“No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,\nStubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was\nthe same you say is now on board the Pequod?”“Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live\nfor ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any\nparson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a\nlatch-key to get into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can\ncrawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”“How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”"

Nor all the coopers in creation\ncouldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”“But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you\nmeant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if\nhe’s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to\nlive for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me\nthat?“Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”“But he’d crawl back.”“Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”“Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and\ndrown you—what then?”“I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black\neyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\nlives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn\nthe devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil?

There’s a governor!”“Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”“Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now\nto keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious\ngoing on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look\nhere, Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord\nI’ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,\nand give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come\nshort off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he\nfinds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the\npoor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”“And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”“Do with it?

As before, the Pequod steeply\nleaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of\nboth heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may\nwell believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go\nover that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant’s and you come\nback again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep\ntrimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,\nand then you will float light and right.In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the\nship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the\ncase of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut\noff whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed\nand hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to\nwhat is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present\ncase, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;\nand the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair\nof overburdening panniers.Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever\nand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own\nhand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his\nshadow; while, if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only\nto blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish\nspeculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing\nthings.CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\njoin them, and lay together our own."

  "content": "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\nregularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we\nmay freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\ndeck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\nstudy practical cetology than here?In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\nthese heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\ncertain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right\nWhale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head.\nAs you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\nhim, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\ndignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\nsummit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\nis what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two\nmost important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\nhead, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you\nnarrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\nfancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\nmagnitude of the head.Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\nthan he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s\neyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for\nyourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\nthrough your ears. You would find that you could only command some\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\nand about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\nbehind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\nthe front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?"

  "content": "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\nthe whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\nsolid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\ntwo lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\nimpressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\nmust see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\npicture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\nnothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\nthe whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\ndistinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\nwhale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\nhint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\nis involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\nwhatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience\nwill teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\nthings at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and\ncompletely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at\none and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\nand touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\nobjects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\norder to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\nbear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\nconsciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\nthemselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\ncomprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the\nsame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\none side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\ncan, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\nsimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\nproblems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\nincongruity in this comparison.It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\nbeset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\nfrights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\nproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\ndivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them."

With\nrespect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\nbetween the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\nan external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\nover with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\nworld through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\nwhich is smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens\nof Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\ncathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\nhearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?\nSubtilize it.Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\nover the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending\nby a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not\nthat the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we\nmight descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But\nlet us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What\na really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,\nlined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as\nbridal satins.But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\nlike the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one\nend, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\nand expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\nalas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\nspikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\nwhen fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\nsuspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\nstraight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\nship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\njaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\nreproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon\nhim."

With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances\nthe gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being\nrigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag\nstumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally\nforty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;\nnor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn\ninto slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right\nWhale’s head.As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a\nRoman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly\nrounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather\ninelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred\nyears ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\nshoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the\nnursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\nlodged, she and all her progeny."

  "content": "But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit\nand look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole\nhead for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in\nits sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,\ncrested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,\nbarnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the\nSouthern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes\nsolely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\nwith a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those\nlive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost\nsure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\ntechnical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\ntake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\ndiademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\nhim in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a\nvery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower\nlip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\ncarpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\nsulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.\nThe fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an\nimportant interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when\nearthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery\nthreshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at\nMackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good\nLord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet\nhigh, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular\nridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us\nwith those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,\nsay three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the\nhead or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere\nbeen cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with\nhairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in\nwhose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes\nthrough the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of\nbone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious\nmarks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\ncreature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the\ncertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the\nsavor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we\nmust grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance\nwill seem reasonable.In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\nconcerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\n“whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a\nthird old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:\n“There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\nupper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”"

  "content": "*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\nrather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\nupper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts\nimpart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\ncountenance.As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”\n“blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and\nother stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has\nlong been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was\nin its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those\nancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as\nyou may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we\nnowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a\ntent spread over the same bone.But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\nstanding in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all\nthese colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not\nthink you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its\nthousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\nTurkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the\nmouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\nit on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\nshould say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that\namount of oil.Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\nwith—that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\ndifferent heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no\ngreat well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible\nof a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are\nthere any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely\nanything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external\nspout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet\nlie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other\nwill not be very long in following."

This Right Whale I take to have been a\nStoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in\nhis latter years.CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you,\nas a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front\naspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you\ninvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\nunexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may\nbe lodged there.

  "content": "You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,\nthe front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\nwater; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\nconsiderably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long\nsocket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the\nmouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as\nthough your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you\nobserve that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\nhas—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes\nand ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire\nlength from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the\nfront of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single\norgan or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are\nnow to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part\nof the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and\nnot till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\nfull cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is\nas one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents\npartly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised\nof the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that\napparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how\nthe blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.\nJust so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this\nenvelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable\nby any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the\nsharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds\nfrom it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved\nwith horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen\nchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the\nsailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming\ncontact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold\nthere a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and\ntoughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which\nwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By\nitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But\nsupplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as\nordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,\ncapable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,\nas far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the\notherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head\naltogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated\nout of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its\nenvelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has\nhypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled\nhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and\nunsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to\natmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the\nirresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and\ndestructive of all elements contributes."

But to comprehend it aright, you must\nknow something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated\nupon.Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\ninclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower\nis the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an\nunctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the\nexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the\nforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two\nalmost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal\nwall of a thick tendinous substance.*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\nmathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\nsolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\nsteep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\nsides."

The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great\nHeidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is\nmystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms\ninnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\nwondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished\nwith the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun\nof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily\nvintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,\nlimpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found\nunalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains\nperfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon\nbegins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when\nthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale’s\ncase generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from\nunavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and\ndribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish\nbusiness of securing what you can.I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was\ncoated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not\npossibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like\nthe lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm\nWhale’s case.It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\nembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as\nhas been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole\nlength of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet\nfor a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the\ndepth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a\nship’s side.As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\nspermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest\na careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly\nlet out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the\nhead, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in\nthat position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen\ncombinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\nquarter.Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in\nthis particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm\nWhale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.CHAPTER 78.

He has carried\nwith him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\ntravelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\nit hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\nis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\nthe other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he\nlands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated above the\nrest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish\nMuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\nshort-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches\nfor the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business\nhe proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\nsounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\nthis cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like\na well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\nIndian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\nbucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word\nto the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like\na dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the\nfull-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\nemptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through\nthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\nend, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper\nand deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone\ndown."
