Then, in darting at the\nmonster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\ncorporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\nYet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\nmonths of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\none hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\nCape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\nanother; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on\nthe homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals\nduring the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a\nleg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was\nmoreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to\nlace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a\nstrait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when\nrunning into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails\nspread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,\nthe old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\nand issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\ndireful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,\nraved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\nWhen you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\nstill subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\ncontracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his\nnarrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been\nleft behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural\nintellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\ninstrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\nstormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\nconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\nhis strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\nreasonable object."

Winding\nfar down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\nwe here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your\nway, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\nwhere far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root\nof grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\nburied beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\nthrone, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\nages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that\nproud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\nexiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\nState-secret come.Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\nare sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\nchange, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\ndissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\nwas only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\nNevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\nterrible casualty which had overtaken him."

And so too, all the added moodiness which\nalways afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\npresent voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\naccount of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\nisle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons\nhe was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\nscorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\nidea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart\nhis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\nOr, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\nyet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\nhis underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,\nthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\nhim, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\nonly and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one\nof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking\nin him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on\nprofitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\nmint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural\nrevenge.Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses\na Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made\nup of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled\nalso, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in\nStarbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in\nStubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so\nofficered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality\nto help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so\naboundingly responded to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their\nsouls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the\nWhite Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to\nbe—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\nunderstandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have\nseemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to\nexplain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean\nminer that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by\nthe ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the\nirresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand\nstill? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the\nplace; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see\nnaught in that brute but the deadliest ill.CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he\nwas to me, as yet remains unsaid."

That ghastly whiteness it is which\nimparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,\nto the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\ntiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded\nbear or shark.**With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who\nwould fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the\nwhiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable\nhideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,\nit might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the\nirresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\nfleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together\ntwo such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\nwith so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;\nyet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified\nterror.As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the\nsame quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly\nhit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish\nmass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence\n_Requiem_ denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.\nNow, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,\nand the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him _Requin_."

Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,\nunflattering laureate, Nature.**I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged\ngale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch\nbelow, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the\nmain hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and\nwith a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its\nvast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous\nflutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered\ncries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its\ninexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took\nhold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white\nthing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\nwaters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of\ntowns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only\nhint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and\nturning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!\nnever had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious\nthing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\nlearned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no\npossibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with\nthose mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon\nour deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to\nbe an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a\nlittle brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in\nthis, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey\nalbatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such\nemotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl."

He was the\nelected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\ndays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At\ntheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\nevery evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his\nmane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more\nresplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A\nmost imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western\nworld, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the\nglories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,\nbluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid\nhis aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly\nstreamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his\ncircumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White\nSteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through\nhis cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to\nthe bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.\nNor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this\nnoble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so\nclothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it\nwhich, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain\nnameless terror.But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\naccessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\nAlbatross."

The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive\ndeformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him\nmore strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be\nso?Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not\nthe less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this\ncrowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\ngauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\nSquall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice\nomitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of\nthat passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\nfaction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\nmarket-place!Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all\nmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It\ncannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of\nthe dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering\nthere; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\nconsternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And\nfrom that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the\nshroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail\nto throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in\na milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that\neven the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on\nhis pallid horse.Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious\nthing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest\nidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul."

From hand to hand, the buckets went in the\ndeepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the\nsteady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,\nwhose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a\nCholo, the words above.“Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”“Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”“There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a cough—it\nsounded like a cough.”“Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”“There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers turning\nover, now!”“Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits\nye eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the\nbucket!”“Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”“Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old\nQuakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re\nthe chap.”“Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody\ndown in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I\nsuspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell\nFlask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the\nwind.”“Tish! the bucket!”CHAPTER 44. The Chart."

Then seating\nhimself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various\nlines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady\npencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At\nintervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein\nwere set down the seasons and places in which, on various former\nvoyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\nhead, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever\nthrew shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till\nit almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and\ncourses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing\nlines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\ncabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were\nbrought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and\nothers were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before\nhim, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to\nthe more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\nit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\ncreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem\nto Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby\ncalculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling\nto mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular\nlatitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to\ncertainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that\nground in search of his prey.So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\nsperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\nthat, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\nwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\ncollated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\nflights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct\nelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*"

  "content": "*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\n  an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n  Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it\n  appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n  portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the\n  ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of\n  longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\n  columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which\n  districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have\n  been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to\n  show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been\n  seen.”Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\nsperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret\nintelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;\ncontinuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating\nexactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one\ntithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the\ndirection taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel,\nand though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own\nunavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these\ntimes he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width\n(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but\nnever exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when\ncircumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at\nparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating\nwhales may with great confidence be looked for.And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\nthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his\nart, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be\nwholly without prospect of a meeting."

Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\nfor particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\nherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\nsay, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\nfound there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and\nunquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In\ngeneral, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the\nsolitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that\nthough Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what\nis called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on\nthe Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to\nvisit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she\nwould infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding\ngrounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed\nonly his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his\nplaces of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing\nhis object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to\nwhatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities\nwould become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every\npossibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and\nplace were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the\nSeason-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,\nMoby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for\nawhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\ninterval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of\nthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the\nwaves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot\nwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\nvengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\nvigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering\nhunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one\ncrowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those\nhopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\nunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest."

No possible endeavor then could enable her\ncommander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\nthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\nPacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next\nensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,\nperhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very\ncomplexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\nof impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\nif by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote\nfrom his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow\noff the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any\nother waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,\nNor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,\nmight blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\nPequod’s circumnavigating wake."

Yes. For the peculiar\nsnow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be\nunmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to\nhimself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\nwould throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape?\nHis broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!\nAnd here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a\nweariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air\nof the deck he would seek to recover his strength.

Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms\nof some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the\nplainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the\nscheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab\nthat had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to\nburst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living\nprinciple or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated\nfrom the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its\nouter vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\nscorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it\nwas no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless\nleagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s\ncase, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme\npurpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced\nitself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent\nbeing of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common\nvitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the\nunbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that\nglared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room,\nwas for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being,\na ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and\ntherefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts\nhave created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus\nmakes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that\nvulture the very creature he creates."

  "content": "First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\nreceiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\ninterval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the\nsame hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\nprivate cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where\nthree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I\nthink it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\nthem happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\nAfrica, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far\ninto the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,\noften endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with\nall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\nunknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been\non its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\nbrushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\nThis man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\nother. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;\nthat is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second\nattack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,\nafterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so\nfell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the\nlast time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the\nwhale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say\nthree years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three\ninstances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard\nof many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there\nis no good ground to impeach.Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\nthe world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\nhistorical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\ndistant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\nthus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\npeculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar\nin that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\npeculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\nvaluable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\nof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\nsuch a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most\nfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\ntarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\nwithout seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some\npoor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they\nmake distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they\npursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump\nfor their presumption."

Was it not\nso, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so\nlong did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was\noft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay?

Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,\nmarked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In\nplain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of\nCetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various\ntimes creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were\nfinally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed\nby valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that\nexpress object as much in view, as in setting out through the\nNarragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture\nthat notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the\nIndian King Philip.I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make\nmention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in\nprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the\nwhole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For\nthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full\nas much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of\nthe plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some\nhints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the\nfishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still\nworse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory."
