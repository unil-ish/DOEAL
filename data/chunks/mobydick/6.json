  "content": "BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon\na monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\nwhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\nAtlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\nin his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\nportly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\nis some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\npart of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\nupon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\nwavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\nback. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\nmen are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\nrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\nstraight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\nupon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\nswimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems\nthe banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark\nthat style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\nspecies denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\nwhales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts."

  "content": "In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\nin vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded\nupon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that\nthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to\nafford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other\ndetached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\nHow then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\npeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\nwithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\nother and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the\nhumpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.\nThen, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these\nhas baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the\nsame with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,\nthey form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of\nthem detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all\ngeneral methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one\nof the whale-naturalists has split."

Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\nGreenland whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have\nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\nGreenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\nleviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\navailable to the systematizer as those external ones already\nenumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales\nbodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.\nAnd this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only\none that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.BOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen\non the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,\nand towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\nvaluable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of\nall the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any\nother of them.BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER V. (_Razor Back_).—Of this whale little is\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a\nretiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\ncoward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which\nrises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor\ndoes anybody else.BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER VI. (_Sulphur Bottom_).—Another retiring\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the\nTartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;\nat least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and\nthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\nnever chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\ntold of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true\nof ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.Thus ends BOOK I. (_Folio_), and now begins BOOK II. (_Octavo_).OCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which\npresent may be numbered:—I., the _Grampus_; II., the _Black Fish_;\nIII., the _Narwhale_; IV., the _Thrasher_; V., the _Killer_."

  "content": "*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.\nBecause, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of\nthe former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them\nin figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form\ndoes not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume\ndoes.BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER I. (_Grampus_).—Though this fish, whose\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\nlandsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\npopularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised\nhim for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to\ntwenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the\nwaist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil\nis considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the\ngreat sperm whale.BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER II. (_Black Fish_).—I give the popular\nfishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and\nsuggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the\nHyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\nprofitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\nHyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\nemployment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and\nquite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\nThough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil."

  "content": "BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril\nwhale_.—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found\non the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\nsay. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\nbill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\nsaid it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\nsurface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\nhorn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\nsurmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\nhorn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,\nand the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the\nUnicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From\ncertain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\nsea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\nagainst poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.\nIt was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\nOriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that\nvoyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\nfrom a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the\nThames; “when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black\nLetter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long\nhorn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle\nat Windsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature."

He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).—Of this whale little is\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\nnaturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of\nFeegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and\nhangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\nThe Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\nsea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER V. (_Thrasher_).—This gentleman is famous\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He\nmounts the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by\nflogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\nprocess. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both\nare outlaws, even in the lawless seas.Thus ends BOOK II. (_Octavo_), and begins BOOK III.

The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may\npossibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five\nfeet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular\nsense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down\nabove as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my\ndefinition of what a whale is—_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal\ntail."

  "content": "BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER 1. (_Huzza Porpoise_).—This is the\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own\nbestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\nmust be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always\nswims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of\nfine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.\nThey are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted\na lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\nthese vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly\ngamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield\nyou one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid\nextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among\njewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat\nis good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a\nporpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very\nreadily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;\nand you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER II. (_Algerine Porpoise_).—A pirate.\nVery savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat\nlarger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.\nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many\ntimes, but never yet saw him captured.BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER III. (_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).—The\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it\nis known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\ndesignated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In\nshape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a\nless rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\ngentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel\nhue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his\nside fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark\nin a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from\nstem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.\nThe white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which\nmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a\nmeal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of\nthe common porpoise.* * * * * *"

But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\nhalf-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by\nreputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their\nfore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to\nfuture investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If\nany of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then\nhe can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his\nFolio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk\nWhale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the\nCannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale;\nthe Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,\nDutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists\nof uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names.

This whole book is but a draught—nay, but the\ndraught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\nas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\nfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\nof course in any other marine than the whale-fleet."
 },

  "role": "user",
  "content": "The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\nperson now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\nofficer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\nusage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\nthose days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation\nand general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\ndepartment and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\nreigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\ntitle of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\nsenior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more\ninferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\nin the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\nboat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\nground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand\npolitical maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\nfrom the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\ntheir social equal.Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\nthis—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\nso, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\nthe after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\nthe captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\nit.Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest\nof all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and\nthe community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high\nor low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their\ncommon luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\nhard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a\nless rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\nhow much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some\nprimitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious\nexternals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,\nand in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as\nmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the\nshabbiest of pilot-cloth."

That certain sultanism of\nhis brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;\nthrough those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\nirresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what\nit will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over\nother men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\nentrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.\nThis it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes of the Empire from\nthe world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can\ngive, to those men who become famous more through their infinite\ninferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than\nthrough their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\nSuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\nsuperstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot\nimbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of\nNicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an\nimperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the\ntremendous centralization.

But ere stepping into\nthe cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\nthen, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,\nin the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\nsame commander’s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say\ndeprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the\ntable; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.

In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\nserved. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\ntheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved\nthe chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\nwould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\nknife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\nthereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his\nmeat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\nstarted if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\nit noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\nthe Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\nprofoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\nwere somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old\nAhab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb.

Whether he\nthought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its\nclotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so\nlong a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and\ntherefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\nwas a butterless man!"

Besides, if it were so that any\nmere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s\nofficial capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\nvengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\nawful Ahab.Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\nin the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\norder to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\nrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the\nthree harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary\nlegatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and\nmighty cabin."

While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid\nof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed\ntheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined\nlike lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading\nwith spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that\nto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale\nDough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\nquarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he\ndid not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an\nungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\nharpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\nDough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\ninto a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\nbegan laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\nnaturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\nnurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,\nand the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\nDough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\nover."

But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\nnot to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\nbroad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage\nfed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\nbeef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\nmortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so\nmuch so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\nmarks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\nTashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might\nbe picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery\nhanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor\ndid the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for\ntheir lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,\nthey would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\nnot at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget\nthat in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\nguilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!\nhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin\nshould he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his\ngreat delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to\nhis credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling\nin them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards."

So that, in real truth,\nthe mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\nhave lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\nwas something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a\nmoment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\nresiding in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\nwas no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\nincluded in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\nlived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\nMissouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan\nof the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the\nwinter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old\nage, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed\nupon the sullen paws of its gloom!CHAPTER 35.

  "content": "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\nvery ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\nhere. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\nEgyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\nFor though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\ntheir tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\nor Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\nstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the\ndread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\nbuilders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\nnation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\nbelief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\nastronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\nstair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\nprodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\nwont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\nlook-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\nin sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,\nwho built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the\nground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a\ndauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\nplace by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\neverything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\nstanders-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\nand bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\ndiscovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of\nthe column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\nwhether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great\nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\nBaltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars, his column marks that\npoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral\nNelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\nTrafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\nsmoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\nNelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\nbefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\nhowever it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\nthick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be\nshunned."

The worthy Obed tells us,\nthat in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\nlaunched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected\nlofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by\nmeans of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.\nA few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New\nZealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\nboats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we\nthen to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The\nthree mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen\ntaking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other\nevery two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\npleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is\ndelightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,\nstriding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while\nbeneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\nof the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\nColossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of\nthe sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\nindolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\ninto languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\nuneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\nwith startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into\nunnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\nsecurities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what\nyou shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more\nare snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable."

  "content": "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\nmast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\nof the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of\nanything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\ncomfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\na hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\nmost usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you\nstand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\ncalled the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To\nbe sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\nthe shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest\nwatch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul\nis glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about\nin it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing\n(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a\nwatch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\nadditional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of\ndrawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\nyour watch-coat."

  "content": "Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\npulpits, called _crow’s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\nwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\nthe fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the\nIcebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\nre-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this\nadmirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\ncharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n_crow’s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s\ngood craft. He called it the _Sleet’s crow’s-nest_, in honor of\nhimself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\nafter our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and\npatentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other\napparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something\nlike a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\nfurnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head\nin a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into\nit through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or\nside next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\nunderneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\nrack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\nother nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\nmast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\nrifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\nand shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or\nvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\nwater, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it\nwas plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,\nall the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he\nso enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\nscientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small\ncompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors\nresulting from what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle\nmagnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\nthe ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having\nbeen so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though\nthe Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\nlearned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and\n“approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail\nbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\ncase-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within\neasy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and\neven love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it\nvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while\nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\naloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the\npole."

For one, I used\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\nchat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\nthen ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\ntop-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\nat last mount to my ultimate destination.Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\nbut sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\ncould I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\naltitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\nwhale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out\nevery time.”And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\nNantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\nlean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who\noffers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware\nof such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be\nkilled; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes\nround the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor\nare these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery\nfurnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded\nyoung men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches\nhimself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,\nand in moody phrase ejaculates:—“Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand\nblubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”"
