  "content": "At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing\nthe whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a\nsharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,\none of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a\nvast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship\nreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,\nupon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\non the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent\nmotions of the head.“Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand\nholding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he\nwould still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,\nrammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the\nburied harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.“In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge\nthere?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on\ntop of his head? Avast, will ye!”“Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a\nrocket.Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\ndropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the\nsuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering\ncopper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the\nsailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of\nspray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,\nburied-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the\nsea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked\nfigure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\nhovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my\nbrave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the\nside, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\nand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\nnow jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the\nship.“Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\noverhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust\nupright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust\nforth from the grass over a grave."

  "content": "“Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and\nsoon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and\nwith the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the\nwaiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\nlong in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\nslowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side\nlunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\ndropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\nand so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\nthrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\nwas not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had\nthrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\nsomerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\nthe good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\ndoing as well as could be expected.And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\nQueequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\nsuccessfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and\napparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\nforgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\nand boxing, riding and rowing.I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to\nseem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have\neither seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an\naccident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than\nthe Indian’s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the\nSperm Whale’s well."

  "content": "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought\nthe tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and\nmost corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of\na far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at\nall, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had\nbeen nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the\ndense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,\nas I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of\nwhich sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking\nin this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted\nby the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it\nsank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\nchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.\nYes, it was a running delivery, so it was.Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious\nperishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\nspermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber\nand sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be\nrecalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey\nin the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that\nleaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How\nmany, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and\nsweetly perished there?CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this\nLeviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has\nas yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as\nfor Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,\nor for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the\nPantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of\nthe various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of\nhorses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the\nmodifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his\ndisciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the\nphrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,\nthough I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of\nthese two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all\nthings; I achieve what I can."

  "content": "Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He\nhas no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\nits entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\nthe countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,\ncupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable\nto the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in\nkeeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the\nnose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his\nproportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the\nsculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is\nan added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As\non your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\njolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the\nreflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which\nso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\nroyal beadle on his throne.In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to\nbe had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This\naspect is sublime.In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the\nmorning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has\na touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,\nthe elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is\nas that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their\ndecrees. It signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most\ncreatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip\nof alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\nlike Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\nand all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\ntrack the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\nhigh and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\nDeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\nobject in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\ndistinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\nhe has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,\nand ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;\nthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In\nprofile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\ndepression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark\nof genius."

  "content": "But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a\nbook, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing\nnothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his\npyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale\nbeen known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by\ntheir child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,\nbecause the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,\nor at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of\nprotrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall\nlure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and\nlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now\nunhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove’s high seat, the great\nSperm Whale shall lord it.Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is\nno Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s\nface. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing\nfable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could\nnot read the simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle\nmeanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of\nthe Sperm Whale’s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you\ncan.CHAPTER 80. The Nut.If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist\nhis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to\nsquare.In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\nin length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as\nthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\nbase. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is\nangularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\nmass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to\nbed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in\nanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in\ndepth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at\nleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away\nbehind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\namplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\nsecreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\nthat the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\nof one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in\nstrange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it\nseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence."

  "content": "It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\nthe creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his\ntrue brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The\nwhale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the\ncommon world.If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\nof its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from\nthe same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down\nto the human magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would\ninvoluntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on\none part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man\nhad no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,\nconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\npower, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you\ndeem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea\nfor you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you\nwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung\nnecklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\nskull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely\nundeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the\nGermans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once\npointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with\nthe vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\nbeaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have\nomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\ncerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s\ncharacter will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel\nyour spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine\nnever yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in\nthe firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the\nworld."

  "content": "Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\ncavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\nthe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being\neight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As\nit passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but\nfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,\nthis canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the\nspinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And\nwhat is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s\ncavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal\nto that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be\nunreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically?\nFor, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his\nbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative\nmagnitude of his spinal cord.But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the\nSperm Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\nof the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\nconvex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call\nthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm\nWhale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have\nreason to know.CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,\nDerick De Deer, master, of Bremen.At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and\nGermans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide\nintervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with\ntheir flag in the Pacific.For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.\nWhile yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a\nboat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the\nbows instead of the stern.“What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something\nwavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”“Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s\ncoming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big\ntin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all\nright, is the Yarman.”“Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.\nHe’s out of oil, and has come a-begging.”However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\nwhale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old\nproverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing\nreally happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did\nindubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare."

  "content": "As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all\nheeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German\nsoon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately\nturning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some\nremarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in\nprofound darkness—his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a\nsingle flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by\nhinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically\ncalled a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name\nof Jungfrau or the Virgin.His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his\nship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the\nmast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that\nwithout pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed\nround his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German\nboats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the\nPequod’s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their\ndanger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before\nthe wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in\nharness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling\na great wide parchment upon the sea.Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,\nhumped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as\nby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed\nafflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this\nwhale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is\nnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.\nNevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\nmust have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\ncurrents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth\nwith a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,\nfollowed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to\nhave egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind\nhim to upbubble.“Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m\nafraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse\nwinds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind\nI ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so\nbefore? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.”"

  "content": "As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck\nload of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her\nway; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly\nturning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious\nwake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost\nthat fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.“Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded\narm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.“Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the\nGerman will have him.”With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one\nfish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most\nvaluable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were\ngoing with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for\nthe time. At this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the three\nGerman boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,\nDerick’s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his\nforeign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being\nalready so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron\nbefore they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he\nseemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally\nwith a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.“The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and\ndares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes\nago!”—then in his old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to\nit!”“I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s against my\nreligion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous\nYarman—Pull—won’t ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye\nlove brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why\ndon’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an\nanchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s\ngrass growing in the boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s\nbudding. This won’t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long\nof it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?”"

Oh! my lads, _do_\nspring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked clams\nand muffins—oh, _do_, _do_, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t lose\nhim now—don’t oh, _don’t!_—see that Yarman—Oh, won’t ye pull for your\nduff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t ye love sperm? There\ngoes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a whole bank! The bank of\nEngland!—Oh, _do_, _do_, _do!_—What’s that Yarman about now?”At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the\nadvancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of\nretarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically\naccelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.“The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty\nthousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,\nTashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces\nfor the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”“I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s\nthree boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,\nmomentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the\nheadsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\nproudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating\ncry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down\nwith the Yarman! Sail over him!”But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\ntheir gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\na righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the\nblade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to\nfree his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh\nto capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that\nwas a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took\na mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s\nquarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the\nwhale’s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was\nthe foaming swell that he made."

  "content": "It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\nnow going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\ntormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\nfright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering\nflight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank\nin the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So\nhave I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles\nin the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird\nhas a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the\nfear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted\nin him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his\nspiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while\nstill, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there\nwas enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s\nboats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick\nchose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long\ndart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all\nthree tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their\nfeet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their\nbarbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three\nNantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and\nwhite-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong\nrush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and\nhis baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three\nflying keels.“Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing\nglance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all\nright—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve\ndistressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel\na sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a\nmad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a\ntilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to\nhim that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you\nstrike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going\nto Davy Jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this\nwhale carries the everlasting mail!”"

  "content": "But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\ntumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\nthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\nwhile so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\nsoon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\ncaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\nlast—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\nthe boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the\ngunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\nsterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for\nsome time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\nline, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\nbeen taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as\nit is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\nthe back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\nagain to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the\nperil of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always\nthe best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\nstricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,\nowing to the enormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale\nsomething less than 2000 square feet—the pressure of the water is\nimmense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we\nourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how\nvast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two\nhundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty\natmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty\nline-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on\nboard.As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\ninto its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\nsort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;\nwhat landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and\nplacidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\nagony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.\nSeems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\nwas suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and\nto what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was\nonce so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\nor his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him\ncannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron\nas straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;\nhe laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This the creature? this he? Oh!\nthat unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of\na thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\nmountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s fish-spears!In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats\nsent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad\nenough to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the\nwounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!“Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly\nvibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\nmagnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every\noarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part\nfrom the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce\nupwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are\nscared from it into the sea.“Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”"

In most land\nanimals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,\nwhereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly\nshut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose\npeculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the\nblood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a\nharpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\nsystem; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\nwater at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to\npour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\nblood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that\nhe will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even\nas in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs\nof far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled\nupon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the\nlances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the\nnew made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\nspout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending\nits affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet\ncame, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,\nas they significantly call it, was untouched."

His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\nbeheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\nnoblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes\nhad once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\nBut pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\nblind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light\nthe gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate\nthe solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to\nall. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a\nstrangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low\ndown on the flank.“A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”“Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\nulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\nthan sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift\nfury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying\ncrews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring\nthe bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he\nby loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\nmade; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\nthen over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the\nwhite secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\npiteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is\ngradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\nmelancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\nground—so the last long dying spout of the whale.Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\nshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\nImmediately, by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at\ndifferent points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\nwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very\nheedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred\nto her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\nfluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the\nbody would at once sink to the bottom."

  "content": "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\nthe entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his\nflesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the\nstumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured\nwhales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence\nof any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have\nbeen some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\nthe ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\nlance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\nthe flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\nwhen? It might have been darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before\nAmerica was discovered.What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\ncabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\ndiscoveries, by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\nto the sea, owing to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink.\nHowever, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to\nthe last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the\nship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with\nthe body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such\nwas the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the\nfluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast\nthem off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the\nother side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a\nhouse. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her\nbulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\ndislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\nimmovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so\nlow had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at\nall approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\nadded to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going\nover.“Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in\nsuch a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something\nor go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,\nand run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big\nchains.”“Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy\nhatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\nat the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were\ngiven, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\nsnap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank."

  "content": "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\nWhale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\naccounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\nbuoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\nsurface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\nbroken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\nbones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\nthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\nsinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\nis not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\nnoble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\nlife, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,\nbuoyant heroes do sometimes sink.Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\naccident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\nRight Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable\nin no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\nhis Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\nincumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\nwhere, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\nagain rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is\nobvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\nmagnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\ncould hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,\namong the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of\nsinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when\nthe body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall\nhave ascended again.It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\nthe Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again\nlowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a\nFin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of\nits incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is\nso similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is\noften mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were\nnow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all\nsail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared\nfar to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.CHAPTER 82.

Every one\nknows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely\nAndromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,\nand as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the\nprince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and\ndelivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,\nrarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as\nthis Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt\nthis Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian\ncoast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast\nskeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and all the inhabitants\nasserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.\nWhen the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in\ntriumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this\nstory, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail."

Besides, it\nwould much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but\nencountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle\nwith the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only\na Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march\nboldly up to a whale.Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the\ncreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\nrepresented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted\non land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance\nof those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;\nand considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale might have\ncrawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal\nridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;\nbearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible\nwith the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to\nhold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.\nIn fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story\nwill fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,\nDagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s\nhead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the\nstump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble\nstamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by\ngood rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most\nnoble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that\nhonorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do\nwith a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer\nwith disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we\nare much better entitled to St. George’s decoration than they."

It nowhere\nappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from\nthe inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary\nwhaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I\nclaim him for one of our clan.But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of\nHercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more\nancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly\nthey are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the\nprophet?Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole\nroll of our order.

When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved\nto recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave\nbirth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical\nbooks, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo\nbefore beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became\nincarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,\nrescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even\nas a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a\nmember-roll for you!
