  "content": "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\nwant of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\nreference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But\nthis objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\nsupposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\n_dead_ whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\ntheir dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has\nbeen divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was\nthrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his\nescape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a\nfigure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some\ncraft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor\nhave there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the\nwhale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an\ninflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was\nsaved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all\nround. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\nthis, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the\nMediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere\nwithin three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much\nmore than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the\nMediterranean coast. How is that?But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within\nthat short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by\nthe way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage\nthrough the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up\nthe Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the\ncomplete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of\nthe Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any\nwhale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of\nGood Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\nthat great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and\nso make modern history a liar.But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\nfoolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing\nthat he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the\nsun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and\nabominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a\nPortuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh\nvia the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the\ngeneral miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly\nenlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.\nAnd some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s\nVoyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which\nMosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling."

  "content": "To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are\nanointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an\nanalogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it\nto be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly\nbe of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are\nhostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to\nmake the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing\nhis boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau\ndisappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;\ncrawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in\nthe unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair\nfrom the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to\nsome particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the\nevent.Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to\nthem, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered\nflight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great\nexertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the\nstricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal\nflight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the\nplanted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became\nimperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to\nhaul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and\nfurious. What then remained?Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\ncountless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,\nnone exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small\nsword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It\nis only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact\nand feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is\naccurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme\nheadway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or\ntwelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the\nharpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a\nsmall rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be\nhauled back to the hand after darting.But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though\nthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is\nseldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on\naccount of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\ncompared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a\ngeneral thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before\nany pitchpoling comes into play."

  "content": "Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\nequanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel\nin pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\nflying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet\nahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along\nits length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers\nup the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in\nhis grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full\nbefore his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,\ncovering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,\nthereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon\nhis palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\nbalancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless\nimpulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\ndistance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of\nsparkling water, he now spouts red blood.“That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal\nFourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old\nOrleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,\nTashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink\nround it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the\nspread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the\nliving stuff.”Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,\nthe spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful\nleash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is\nslackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and\nmutely watches the monster die.CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages\nbefore—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and\nsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many\nsprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,\nthousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the\nwhale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should\nbe, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter\nminutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.\n1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,\nafter all, really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a\nnoteworthy thing."

Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\ngills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\nis combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a\ncod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\nsurface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\nregular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\nin any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,\nthe Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the\nsurface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his\nmouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the\ntop of his head."

  "content": "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\nindispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\ncertain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\nblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\nshall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\nAssume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\naerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\nfetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\nlive without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\ncase with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\nhour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\nso much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\nno gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\nhe is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\nvermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\ncompletely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or\nmore, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\nvitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\ncarries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\nsupplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\nindisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\nand true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\ninexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,\nas the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon\nrising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period\nof time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he\nstays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy\nbreaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his\nseventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\nbreaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up\nagain to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those\nseventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\nterm below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates\nare different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale\nthus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\nhis reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,\nthat this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal\nhazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast\nleviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\nsunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great\nnecessities that strike the victory to thee!"

  "content": "In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for\ntwo or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\nattend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\nSperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\nif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\nthen I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\nsmell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\nall answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\nclogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\nof smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water\nor whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\non this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no\nproper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no\nviolets, no Cologne-water in the sea.Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\ncanal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished\nwith a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\nair or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\nunless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he\ntalks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\nSeldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\nworld, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\nliving. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!"

  "content": "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\nfor the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\nhorizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\nto one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\nin a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\nthis gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout\nof the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether\nthat exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\nindirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\nproved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\nspiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\nwhen in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s\nfood is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\nwould. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\nwatch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\nrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\nrespiration.But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\nYou have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\ntell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\nsettle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\nknottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand\nin it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\nit; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\nwhen, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\nof his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all\naround him. And if at such times you should think that you really\nperceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\nnot merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are\nnot those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\nfissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For\neven when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\nhis elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then,\nthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\nblazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\nrain."

  "content": "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\nprecise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\ninto it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\nthis fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\nslight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will\noften happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\nthe thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\ncontact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or\notherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\nWherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\nevade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\nit, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind\nyou. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is\nto let this deadly spout alone.Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\nhypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\nother reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\ntouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I\naccount him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\nfact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\nwhales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\nconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\nPlato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\nup a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\nthoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\ncuriosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected\nthere, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over\nmy head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep\nthought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an\nAugust noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\nsupposition.And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\nbehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\nhead overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\ncontemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified\nby a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.\nFor, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate\nvapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my\nmind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a\nheavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\nbut doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of\nall things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this\ncombination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who\nregards them both with equal eye.CHAPTER 86. The Tail."

  "content": "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\nand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,\nI celebrate a tail.Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point\nof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\nupon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.\nThe compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat\npalms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in\nthickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,\nthen sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy\nbetween. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely\ndefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost\nexpansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\ntwenty feet across.The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\ninto it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,\nmiddle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long\nand horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\ncrosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\nanything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\nwalls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\ncourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\nrelics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\ngreat strength of the masonry.But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\nthe whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\nmuscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\nand running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\nlargely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\nmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\nCould annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it."

  "content": "Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\nflexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a\nTitanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most\nappalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or\nharmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly\nbeautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied\ntendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\nHercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the\nlinen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with\nthe massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.\nWhen Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what\nrobustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in\nthe Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which\nhis idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so\ndestitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but\nthe mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on\nall hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his\nteachings.Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\nwielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\nbe in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein\nno fairy’s arm can transcend it.Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\nFourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\nwriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\nwhale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\nforwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\nthis which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster\nwhen furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\nconflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\nstriking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\nblow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\nair, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\nirresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\nsalvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\nopposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\nwhale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a\ndashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the\nmost serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received\nin the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one\nstrips off a frock, and the hole is stopped."

  "content": "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\nthe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\nthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\nelephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\nsweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\nthe sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,\nwhiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\nHad this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\nDarmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\nsalutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\nzones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\npossess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\nanother elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\ntrunk and extracted the dart.Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\nmiddle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\nof his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\nhearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\ntail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\nthunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\ngreat gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of\nvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\nthat was the smoke from the touch-hole."

  "content": "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\nlie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\nout of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\nthe deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\ntossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\ndownwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere\nelse to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the\ngrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\nprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\nhighest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting\nforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\ngazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the\nDantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\narchangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\ncrimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\nall heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\npeaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\nof adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\nthe fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\nelephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\ndevout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\nelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\nuplifted in the profoundest silence.The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\nelephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\nof the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite\norgans on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\nrespectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\nLeviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the\nstalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were\nas the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\ncrash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated\ninstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\noars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his\nballs.**Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and\nthe elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\nelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does\nto the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of\ncurious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the\nelephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\nelevating it, jet it forth in a stream."

At times there are gestures in it, which,\nthough they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\ninexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\nthese mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them\nakin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these\nmethods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting\nother motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,\nand unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I\nmay, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I\nknow not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much\nmore, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my\nback parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.\nBut I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will\nabout his face, I say again he has no face.CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from\nthe territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.\nIn a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of\nSumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast\nmole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and\ndividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded\noriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports\nfor the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are\nthe straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,\nvessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing\nmidway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green\npromontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond\nto the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and\nconsidering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,\nand gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental\nsea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such\ntreasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the\nappearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping\nwestern world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with\nthose domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\nMediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these\nOrientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from\nthe endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries\npast, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra\nand Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while\nthey freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce\ntheir claim to more solid tribute."

  "content": "Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the\nlow shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the\nvessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the\npoint of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they\nhave received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these\ncorsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present\nday, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in\nthose waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these\nstraits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and\nthence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here\nand there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands,\nand gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season\nthere. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost\nall the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to\ndescending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere\nelse foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby\nDick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he\nmight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his\ncrew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,\nnow, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs\nno sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the\nwhaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be\ntransferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries\nno cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a\nwhole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with\nutilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She\ncarries years’ water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,\nwhen three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to\ndrink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,\nfrom the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other\nships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at\na score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have\nsighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating\nseamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that\nanother flood had come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the\nark!”"

  "content": "Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of\nJava, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of\nthe ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\nexcellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and\nmore upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and\nadmonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the\nland soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the\nfresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\ndescried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the\ncustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle\nof singular magnificence saluted us.But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with\nwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm\nWhales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached\ncompanies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive\nherds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost\nseem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and\ncovenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of\nthe Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now\nsometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by\na single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems\nthousands on thousands.Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\nforming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\ncontinuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\nnoon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\nWhale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the\ncleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of\nthe Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually\nrising and falling away to leeward.Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of\nthe sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the\nair, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed\nlike the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried\nof a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height."

If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that\nchased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy\ninto the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\nnumber. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby\nDick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped\nwhite-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\nstun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly\ndirecting attention to something in our wake.Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our\nrear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling\nsomething like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\ncompletely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally\ndisappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved\nin his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to\nwet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”"

But when the\nswift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how\nvery kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on\nto her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that\nthey were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in\nhis forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one\nthe bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above\nseemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery\ndefile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that\nthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that\nthrough that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his\ndeadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates\nand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with\ntheir curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,\nAhab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after\nsome stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the\nfirm thing from its place.But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\nwhen, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\nPequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\nside, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\nharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\ngaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake\nof the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the\nship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to\nspring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed\nwonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three\nkeels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than\nthey rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that\ntheir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved\non with redoubled velocity."

The compact martial columns in\nwhich they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now\nbroken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus’ elephants in\nthe Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with\nconsternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,\nand aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\nspoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was\nstill more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely\nparalysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled\nships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple\nsheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not\npossibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\ntimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though\nbanding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the\nWest have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human\nbeings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,\nthey will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the\noutlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each\nother to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the\nstrangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts\nof the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\nyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\nretreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\nthose cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\nwhale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,\nQueequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\nin our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered\nstraight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part\nof the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise\nunprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;\nyet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the\nfishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the\nfrantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a\ndelirious throb.As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\nspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\nthus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\nthe crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\nlike a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\nthrough their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\nmoment it may be locked in and crushed."

Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their\nwonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to\nthe shouting part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried\none, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\nand for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,\nthere!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\ncalmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\nby the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of\nequal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\nother’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\nattached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\nbeing looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is\nchiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more\nwhales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But\nsperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you\nmust kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you\nmust wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.\nHence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into\nrequisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and\nsecond were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly\nrunning off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing\ndrugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But\nupon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy\nwooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an\ninstant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\nboat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea\ncame in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and\nshirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time."
