  "content": "One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon\ncalled a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices\nout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into\nthis hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then\nhooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for\nwhat follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands\nto stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a\nfew sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in\ntwain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper\nstrip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for\nlowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one\ntackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\nis slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the\nmain hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\nblubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\ncoiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of\nplaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting\nand lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the\nheavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates\nscarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by\nway of assuaging the general friction.CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin\nof the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced\nwhalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion\nremains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you\nknow what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence\nof firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and\nranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness."

  "content": "Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\ncreature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet\nin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;\nbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\nwhale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer\nof any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?\nTrue, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with\nyour hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat\nresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as\nflexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it\nnot only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I\nhave several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.\nIt is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed\npage, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a\nmagnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales\nthrough their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at\nhere is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I\nadmit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be\nregarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to\nspeak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\nthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\nnew-born child. But no more of this.Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,\nas in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\nhundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,\nor rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three\nfourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence\nbe had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose\nmere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten\nbarrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three\nquarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin."

  "content": "In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among\nthe many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over\nobliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\nthick array, something like those in the finest Italian line\nengravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\nisinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as\nif they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some\ninstances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.\nThese are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers\non the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to\nuse in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the\nhieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck\nwith a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the\nfamous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.\nLike those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains\nundecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another\nthing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm\nWhale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially\nhis flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by\nreason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random\naspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,\nwhich Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact\nwith vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a\nlittle resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me\nthat such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact\nwith other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\nfull-grown bulls of the species.A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\nwhale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\npieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very\nhappy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber\nas in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho\nslipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of\nthis cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep\nhimself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.\nWhat would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy\nseas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other\nfish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but\nthese, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very\nbellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the\nlee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn\nfire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his\nblood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after\nexplanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as\nindispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at\nhome, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when\nseamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is\nfound glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been\nproved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than\nthat of a Borneo negro in summer."

The vast white headless phantom floats\nfurther and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,\nwhat seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the\nmurderous din.

Espied by some timid man-of-war\nor blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring\nthe swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in\nthe sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the\nwhale’s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the\nlog—_shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years\nafterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly\nsheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there\nwhen a stick was held. There’s your law of precedents; there’s your\nutility of traditions; there’s the story of your obstinate survival of\nold beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in\nthe air! There’s orthodoxy!Thus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real terror\nto his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a\nworld.Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than\nthe Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe\nin them.CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping\nthe body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the\nSperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced\nwhale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;\non the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that\nvery place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the\nsurgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening\nbetween him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a\ndiscoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear\nin mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut\nmany feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without\nso much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus\nmade, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,\nand exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion\ninto the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he\ndemanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a\ncable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small\nwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a\nfull grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head\nembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend\nsuch a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this\nwere as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’\nscales."

And\nthere with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of\nthe enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm\non that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that\nblood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the giant\nHolofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went\nbelow to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but\nnow deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow\nlotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves\nupon the sea.A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone\nfrom his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to\ngaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took\nStubb’s long spade—still remaining there after the whale’s\ndecapitation—and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended\nmass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood\nleaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head."

Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their\nflaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true\nto each other, when heaven seemed false to them.

The Jeroboam’s Story.Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than\nthe ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.By and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads\nproved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and\nshooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the\nPequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what\nresponse would be made.Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\nof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\nsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\nvessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale\ncommanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at\nconsiderable distances and with no small facility."

It turned out that the\nJeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her\ncaptain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though\nhimself and boat’s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was\nhalf a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and\nflowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine\nof the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with\nthe Pequod.But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an\ninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s\nboat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to\nthe Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it\nblew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times\nby the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed\nsome way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper\nbearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now\nand then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at\nintervals not without still another interruption of a very different\nsort.Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual\nnotabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish\nman, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant\nyellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut\ntinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on\nhis wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\nexclaimed—“That’s he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the\nTown-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story\ntold of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time\nprevious when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account\nand what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in\nquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\nJeroboam. His story was this:"

A strange,\napostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,\nwhere, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,\ncommon-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate\nfor the Jeroboam’s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway\nupon the ship’s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in\na freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded\nthe captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he\nset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\nvicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which\nhe declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,\nexcited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real\ndelirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of\nthe ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they\nwere afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical\nuse in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\npleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\napprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first\nconvenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and\nvials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in\ncase this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his\ndisciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the\ncaptain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of\nthem would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor\nwould they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he\nwould; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of\nthe ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared\nlittle or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had\nbroken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the\nplague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be\nstayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor\ndevils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to\nhis instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\nSuch things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.\nNor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\nmeasureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\npower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to\nreturn to the Pequod."

Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that\ninstant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings\ndrowned all speech.“Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted\nback.“Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk!

Nothing was said for some moments, while a\nsuccession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional\ncaprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the\nhoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was\nseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\nnature seemed to warrant.When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\nconcerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from\nGabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed\nleagued with him."

  "content": "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking\na whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of\nMoby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this\nintelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the\nWhite Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering\ninsanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the\nShaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some\nyear or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the\nmast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;\nand the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\nopportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations and\nforewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\nWith them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\nperilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron\nfast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was\ntossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of\nspeedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while\nMacey, the mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the\nreckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\nwhale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a\nbroad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,\ntemporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next\ninstant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\ninto the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea\nat the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was\nharmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\noftener the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the\nheadsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But\nstrangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,\nwhen the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is\ndiscernible; the man being stark dead.The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\ndescried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”\nGabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of\nthe whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added\ninfluence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\nspecifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\nprophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one\nof many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror\nto the ship.Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,\nthat the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\nintended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which\nAhab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to\nhis feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\ndownward pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down\nthere!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just\nbethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy\nofficers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”"

It was sorely\ntumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in\nconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a\nletter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.“Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but\na dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a\nlong cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to\ninsert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without\nits coming any closer to the ship.Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a\nwoman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey,\nShip Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”“Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let\nme have it.”“Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going\nthat way.”“Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to\nreceive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he\ncaught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\nboat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;\nthe boat drifted a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by\nmagic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He\nclutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the\nletter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s\nfeet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\noars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the\nPequod.As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket\nof the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild\naffair.CHAPTER 72.

Now hands\nare wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no\nstaying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has\nto be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the\ndescription of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was\nmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the\nblubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\nspades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\nsame hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\nparticular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to\ndescend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.\nBut in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\nconcluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,\nexcepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\nfeet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\nhalf on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like\na tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured\nin the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at\nleast, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better\nchance to observe him, as will presently be seen.Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\nin his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\nattend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\nwhale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\na long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg\ndown there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\nmonkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\nwaist.It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\nends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\nleather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\nwere wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both\nusage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should\ndrag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature\nunited us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I\nany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\nentailed."

Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\ninterregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\nso gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked\nhim now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\nto jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\nmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\nmost cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a\nplurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\napothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,\nyou may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these\nand the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I\ncame very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do\nwhat I would, I only had the management of one end of it.**The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\nthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This\nimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\nthan Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\npossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\nmonkey-rope holder.I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\nwhale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\nrolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy\nhe was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\nnight, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\npent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures\nswarmed round it like bees in a beehive.And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\naside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it\nnot that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\nmiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man."

Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then\njerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\nseemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another\nprotection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and\nDaggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\nwhale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\nreach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\nbenevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but\nin their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that\nboth he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled\nwater, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a\nleg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping\nthere with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed\nto his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\nand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters\nit, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men\nin this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those\nsharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks\nand spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now,\nas with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last\nclimbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily\ntrembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,\nconsolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye\ngods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!“Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.\n“Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then\nstanding as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the\nastonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have\nthe goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of\nginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to\nkindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is\nginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what\nthe devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor\nQueequeg here.”“There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this\nbusiness,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just\ncome from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,\nif you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The\nsteward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to\nQueequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an\napothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by\nwhich he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”"

You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder\nus all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”“It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the\nginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,\nbut only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”“Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to\nthe lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.\nStarbuck. It is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a\nwhale.”“Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”“Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of\nthat sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying,\nsir?”“Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a\nsort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and\nwas handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that\nwas freely given to the waves.CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk\nover Him.It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s\nprodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it\ncontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to\nit. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for\nthe head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold."

  "content": "Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually\ndrifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,\ngave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the\nLeviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\nanywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of\nthose inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to\ncruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near\nthe Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had\nbeen brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the\nannouncement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,\nif opportunity offered.Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\nboats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further\nand further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at\nthe mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of\ntumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or\nboth the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in\nplain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the\ntowing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first\nit seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\nmaelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from\nview, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the\nship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being\nbrought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty\nof line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they\npaid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their\nmight so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle\nwas intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened\nline in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the\ncontending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few\nfeet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did\ngain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\nalong the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,\nsuddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken\nglass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\nmore the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,\nand blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship\ntowing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete\ncircuit."

But I sometimes think\nhe’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap,\nStubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved\ninto a snake’s head, Stubb?”“Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\ndark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look\ndown there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\nhands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in\ndisguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been\nstowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you\ndon’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries\nit coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of\nit, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”“He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve\nseen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”“No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye\nsee, in the eye of the rigging.”“What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”“Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”"

Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”“I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\none, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old\nflag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\ngentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he\nwas at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching\nhis hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old\ngovernor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting\nmad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the\nLord, Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before\nhe got through with him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look\nsharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get\nthe whale alongside.”“I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask,\nwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden\ntowards the ship, “but I can’t remember where.”“Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?\nDid ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”“No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,\nStubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was\nthe same you say is now on board the Pequod?”“Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live\nfor ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any\nparson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a\nlatch-key to get into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can\ncrawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”“How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”"

Nor all the coopers in creation\ncouldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”“But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you\nmeant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if\nhe’s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to\nlive for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me\nthat?“Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”“But he’d crawl back.”“Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”“Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and\ndrown you—what then?”“I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black\neyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\nlives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much.
