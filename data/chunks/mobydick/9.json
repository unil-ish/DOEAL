  "content": "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\nme, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\nthan one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\nboats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\nPusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let\nme say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\nrunning sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\nsecured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\nhorse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\nthe sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\nnot so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will\nfrequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for\nseveral consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more\nand a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,\nby which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous\nevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but\nthat these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;\nso that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is\nnothing new under the sun.In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate\nof Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and\nBelisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own\ntimes, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he\nhas always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating\nhistorian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting\nthe matter presently to be mentioned.Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\nof his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\nin the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\nyears. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\ngainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species\nthis sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as\nwell as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly\ninclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long\ntime I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\nMediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\ncertain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\nresort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\nmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\nsperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on\nthe Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the\nskeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\nthrough the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,\npass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis."

  "content": "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\nsubstance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\nBut I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\nwhale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\nlarge creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\nfound at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements\ntogether, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\naccording to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for\nhalf a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\nprobability have been a sperm whale.CHAPTER 46. Surmises.Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\nDick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that\none passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and\nlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether\nto abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if\nthis were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\ninfluential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\nconsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\nsperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\nmultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\nprove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be\nindeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\npassion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him."

  "content": "To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\nthe shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,\nfor example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\nover Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\nman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\nmastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in\na sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced\nwill were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain;\nstill he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred\nhis captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself\nfrom it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would\nelapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\ncaptain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle\ninsanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly\nmanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing\nthat, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that\nstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the\nfull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\nbackground (for few men’s courage is proof against protracted\nmeditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night\nwatches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\nthan Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\nhailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are\nmore or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer\nweather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and\npassion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary\ninterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\nsuspended for the final dash."

In times of strong emotion\nmankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\nThe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\nAhab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\nhearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\nbreeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for\nthe love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food\nfor their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\nchivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two\nthousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious\nperquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final\nand romantic object—that final and romantic object, too many would have\nturned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of\nall hopes of cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\nmonths go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this\nsame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\nsoon cashier Ahab."

  "content": "Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\nto Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\nPequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he\nhad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\nusurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\nif so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must\nof course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection\ncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,\nbacked by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute\natmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be\nsubjected to.For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\ndegree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s\nvoyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force\nhimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\npursuit of his profession.Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\nmast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\nabout the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.\nQueequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,\nfor an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet\nsomehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie\nlurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own\ninvisible self."

  "content": "I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I\nkept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the\nlong yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as\nQueequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword\nbetween the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly\nand unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess\ndid there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only\nbroken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as\nif this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically\nweaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of\nthe warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging\nvibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise\ninterblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed\nnecessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle\nand weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,\nQueequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof\nslantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;\nand by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding\ncontrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s\nsword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and\nwoof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free\nwill, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working\ntogether. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its\nultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending\nto that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;\nand chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of\nnecessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though\nthus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the\nlast featuring blow at events.Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\nstrange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of\nfree will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds\nwhence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees\nwas that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly\nforward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden\nintervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that\nvery moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of\nwhalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those\nlungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous\ncadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and\neagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some\nprophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries\nannouncing their coming.“There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”“Where-away?”“On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”Instantly all was commotion.The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and\nreliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from\nother tribes of his genus.“There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales\ndisappeared.“Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact\nminute to Ahab."

  "content": "The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling\nbefore it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to\nleeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of\nour bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale\nwhen, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while\nconcealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in\nthe opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in\naction; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by\nTashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\nvicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not\nappointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the\nmain-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the\nline tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the\nmainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three\nsamphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager\ncrews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly\npoised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about\nto throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took\nevery eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was\nsurrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side\nof the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the\ntackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always\nbeen deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the\ncaptain’s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The\nfigure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white\ntooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese\njacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black\ntrowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness\nwas a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and\ncoiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the\ncompanions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion\npeculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—a race\nnotorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white\nmariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents\non the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose\nto be elsewhere.While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these\nstrangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,\n“All ready there, Fedallah?”“Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.“Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away\nthere, I say.”Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the\nmen sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with\na wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a\ndexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the\nsailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed\nboats below."

But with all their\neyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of\nthe other boats obeyed not the command.“Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.“Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou,\nFlask, pull out more to leeward!”“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his\ngreat steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew.\n“There!—there!—there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay\nback!”“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”“Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now.\nDidn’t I hear ’em in the hold?

They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”“Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\nones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom\nstill showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones,\nmy boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They\nare only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more\nthe merrier.

  "content": "Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had\nrather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in\ninculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this\nspecimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\nwith his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief\npeculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a\ntone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so\ncalculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear\nsuch queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling\nfor the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy\nand indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so\nbroadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a\nyawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon\nthe crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,\nwhose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all\ninferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\nacross Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\npretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.“Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\nplease!”“Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\nspoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set\nlike a flint from Stubb’s.“What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”“Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\nboys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad\nbusiness, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,\nMr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what\nwill. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.\nStubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the\nplay! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”“Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\ndiverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s\nwhat he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long\nsuspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom\nof it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men!\nIt ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”"

  "content": "Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant\nas the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably\nawakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s\ncompany; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got\nabroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some\nsmall measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge\nof their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of\naccounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from\nsuperstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room\nfor all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in\nthe matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the\nmysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the\ndim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the\nunaccountable Elijah.Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\nfurthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\ncircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger\nyellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five\ntrip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which\nperiodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\nboiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen\npulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\ngunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\nhorizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\nfencer’s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance\nany tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar\nas in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All\nat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained\nfixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat\nand crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in\nthe rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily\ndown into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\nmovement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.“Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,\nstand up!”Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\nstood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\nspot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\nstern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\nthe gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\nhimself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\neyeing the vast blue eye of the sea."

It is used for catching turns with the\nwhale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand,\nand standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the\nmast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little\nKing-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post\nwas full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead\nstand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.“I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to\nthat.”Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,\nswiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty\nshoulders for a pedestal.“Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”“That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\nfifty feet taller.”Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\nboat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to\nFlask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head\nand bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous\nfling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was\nFlask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a\nbreastband to lean against and steady himself by.At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\nhabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect\nposture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously\nperverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily\nperched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\nsight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more\ncurious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,\nunthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the\nsea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired\nFlask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.\nThough truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now\nand then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby\ngive to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity\nstamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her\ntides and her seasons for that."

The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,\nnot a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,\nStubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\nlanguishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\nwhere he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\nhome the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his\nmatch across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed\nstars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,\ncrying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all, and give\nway!—there they are!”To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\nvisible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\nwater, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\nrolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\natmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\nwater, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\nindications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning\ncouriers and detached flying outriders.All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\nwater and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as\na mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\nhills.“Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\nintensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\nfrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\nvisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\nto his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\nsilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\npeculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.How different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something,\nmy hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on\ntheir black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you\nmy Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,\nboys. Lay me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring\nmad! See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat\nfrom his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,\nflirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and\nplunging in the boat’s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie."

But what the devil are you\nhurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and\nkeep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your\nknives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take it easy, I\nsay, and burst all your livers and lungs!”But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\nhis—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed\nlight of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious\nseas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of\nred murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of\nFlask to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he\ndeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its\ntail—these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that\nthey would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look\nover the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must\nput out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage\npronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but\narms, in these critical moments.It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the\nomnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled\nalong the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless\nbowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip\nfor an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost\nseemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the\nwatery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the\ntop of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other\nside;—all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and\nthe shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the\nivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like\na wild hen after her screaming brood;—all this was thrilling."

The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted\neverywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.\nThe boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales\nrunning dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still\nrising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through\nthe water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to\nescape being torn from the row-locks.Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither\nship nor boat to be seen.“Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the\nsheet of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall\ncomes. There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted\nthat the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when\nwith a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and\nQueequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril\nso close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance\nof the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent\ninstant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of\nfifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still\nbooming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like\nthe erected crests of enraged serpents.“That’s his hump. _There_, _there_, give it to him!” whispered\nStarbuck."

  "content": "A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\nQueequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\nastern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail\ncollapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;\nsomething rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole\ncrew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the\nwhite curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all\nblended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round\nit we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,\ntumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,\nthe water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing\neyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the\nbottom of the ocean.The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;\nthe whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white\nfire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal\nin these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar\nto the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\nboats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew\ndarker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.\nThe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were\nuseless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.\nSo, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many\nfailures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then\nstretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the\nstandard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up\nthat imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,\nthen, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly\nholding up hope in the midst of despair."

The mist still spread over\nthe sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.\nSuddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.\nWe all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled\nby the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were\ndimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the\nsea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us\nwithin a distance of not much more than its length.Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it\ntossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a\ncataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no\nmore till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were\ndashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely\nlanded on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut\nloose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship\nhad given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon\nsome token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed\naffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast\npractical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more\nthan suspects that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own.\nHowever, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He\nbolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all\nhard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich\nof potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for\nsmall difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril\nof life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,\ngood-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen\nand unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am\nspeaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;\nit comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before\nmight have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part\nof the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to\nbreed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with\nit I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White\nWhale its object."

I suppose\nthen, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy\nsquall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”“Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\nCape Horn.”“Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\nclose by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you\ntell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,\nfor an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into\ndeath’s jaws?”“Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I\nshould like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face\nforemost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind\nthat!”"

Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings\nin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of\ncommon occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the\nsuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign\nmy life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow\nwho at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of\nscuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that\nthe particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be\nimputed to Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a\nsquall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for\nhis great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to\nthis uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s boat; and finally considering in\nwhat a devil’s chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking\nall things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make\na rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I, “come along, you shall be\nmy lawyer, executor, and legatee.”It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at\ntheir last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world\nmore fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical\nlife that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded\nupon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled\naway from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as\ngood as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a\nsupplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might\nbe. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.\nI looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a\nclean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,\nhere goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the\ndevil fetch the hindmost.CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.“Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg\nyou would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole\nwith my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”“I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask.\n“If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.\nThat would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other\nleft, you know.”“I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering\nthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it\nis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active\nperils of the chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in\ntheir eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried\ninto the thickest of the fight."

Considering that\nwith two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;\nconsidering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\nextraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then\ncomprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed\nman to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the\njoint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not."

  "content": "Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of\nhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of\nthe chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving\nhis orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually\napportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for\nCaptain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s\ncrew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads\nof the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s\ncrew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\nNevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that\nmatter. Until Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little\nforeseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of\nport, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then\nfound bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his\nown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even\nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is\nrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was\nobserved in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra\ncoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety\nhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it\nis sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing\nthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was\nobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee\nfixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the\ncarpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a\nlittle there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and\ncuriosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this\nparticular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to\nthe ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his\nintention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition\ndid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew\nbeing assigned to that boat."
