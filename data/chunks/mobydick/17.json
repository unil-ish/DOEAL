For, suspended\nin those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\nwhales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\nmothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\nexceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will\ncalmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two\ndifferent lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,\nbe still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so\ndid the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at\nus, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\nFloating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One\nof these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\nday old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six\nfeet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed\nscarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately\noccupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready\nfor the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.\nThe delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly\nretained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived\nfrom foreign parts.“Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him\nfast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”“What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.“Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\nof fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\nshows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\ntowards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord\nof Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to\nits dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this\nnatural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the\nhempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest\nsecrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We\nsaw young Leviathan amours in the deep.**The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\nunlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\ngestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\none at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\nEsau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\ncuriously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\nthemselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious\nparts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s\npouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk\nis very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well\nwith strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales\nsalute _more hominum_."

But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\nmy being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;\nand while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down\nand deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\nspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\nstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\npossibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\nof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\nof the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\nacross the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\nsometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\nand alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or\nmaiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A\nwhale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\neffectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying\nalong with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony\nof the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\nlone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\ndismay wherever he went.But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\nspectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\nto inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first\nthe intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived\nthat by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale\nhad become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run\naway with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope\nattached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\nharpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose\nfrom his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\nthrough the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\ntossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\ncomrades."

  "content": "This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\nstationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\nbegan to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by\nhalf spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\nheave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\nin more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\ncircles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\ndeparting. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\ntumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\ncentre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly\nStarbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your\noars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,\nyou Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,\nand stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape\nthem!—scrape away!”The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a\nnarrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate\nendeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way\nrapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.\nAfter many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into\nwhat had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random\nwhales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was\ncheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in\nthe bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his\nhead by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad\nflukes close by.Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\nresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\nclumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\nonward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;\nbut the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\nwhales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask\nhad killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of\nwhich are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at\nhand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both\nto mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,\nshould the boats of any other ship draw near."

  "content": "The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious\nsaying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the\ndrugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for\nthe time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some\nother craft than the Pequod.CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\nWhales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\nvast aggregations.Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\nhave been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\noccasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.\nSuch bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those\ncomposed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young\nvigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\nmale of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\nhis gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\nladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\nover the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\nendearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his\nconcubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\nleviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more\nthan one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\ncomparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\nyards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\nwhole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_."

  "content": "It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\nramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in\nleisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the\nfull flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,\nperhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating\nsummer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have\nlounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for\nthe Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so\nevade the other excessive temperature of the year.When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\nsuspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\ninteresting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\ncoming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\nladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\nhim away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are\nto be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do\nwhat the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of\nhis bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often\ncause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with\nthe whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They\nfence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and\nso striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their\nantlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these\nencounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some\ninstances, wrenched and dislocated mouths."

  "content": "But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\nthe first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch\nthat lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\nrevels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,\nlike pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.\nGranting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give\nchase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish\nof their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the\nsons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must\ntake care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For\nlike certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my\nLord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;\nand so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all\nover the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as\nthe ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as\nreflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude\novertakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the\nlove for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,\nadmonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to\nan exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians\nand parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from\nhis amorous errors.Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is\nthe lord and master of that school technically known as the\nschoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however\nadmirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then\ngo abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.\nHis title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the\nname bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the\nman who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read\nthe memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a\ncountry-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and\nwhat was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of\nhis pupils.The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale\nbetakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm\nWhales. Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is\ncalled—proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,\nhe will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to\nwife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though\nshe keeps so many moody secrets.The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously\nmentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while\nthose female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or\nforty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious\nof all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;\nexcepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,\nand these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout."

  "content": "The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a\nmob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,\ntumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no\nprudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous\nlad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,\nand when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about\nin quest of settlements, that is, harems.Another point of difference between the male and female schools is\nstill more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a\nForty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a\nmember of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with\nevery token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as\nthemselves to fall a prey.CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\nfishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,\na whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed\nand captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised\nmany minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For\nexample,—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the\nbody may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and\ndrifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a\ncalm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the\nmost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the\nfishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,\nundisputed law applicable to all cases.Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\nenactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in\nA.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\nlaw, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and\nlawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\ncomprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the\nChinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s\nBusiness. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,\nor the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they."

A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\nbrevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to\nexpound it.First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,\nwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at\nall controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a\nnine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the\nsame. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\nother recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it\nplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well\nas their intention so to do.These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and\nhonorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where\nit would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\npossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But\nothers are by no means so scrupulous."

  "content": "Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated\nin England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of\na whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had\nsucceeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of\ntheir lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\nitself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\nwith the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\nbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\nremonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’\nteeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\ndone, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore\nthe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,\nline, harpoons, and boat.Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\njudge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to\nillustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\nwherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s\nviciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\nthe course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\nrecover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then\nsupported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\nharpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\nher; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then\nbecame that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever\nharpoon might have been found sticking in her.Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the\nwhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very\nlearned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he\nawarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to\nsave their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,\nharpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because\nit was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons\nand line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\nacquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\ntook the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took\nthe fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs."

But ploughed up to the primary rock of the\nmatter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws\npreviously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in\nthe above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,\nI say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human\njurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of\nsculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,\nhas but two props to stand on.Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:\nthat is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often\npossession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of\nRussian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession\nis the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s\nlast mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain’s marble\nmansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?\nWhat is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor\nWoebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from\nstarvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the\nArchbishop of Savesoul’s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread\nand cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure\nof heaven without any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular\n£100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary\ntowns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer,\nJohn Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic\nlancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all\nthese, is not Possession the whole of the law?But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the\nkindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is\ninternationally and universally applicable.What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the\nSpanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and\nmistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What\nIndia to England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All\nLoose-Fish."

Heads or Tails.“De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”\n_Bracton, l. 3, c. 3._Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the\ncontext, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of\nthat land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,\nand the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division\nwhich, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no\nintermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to\nthis day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects a\nstrange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is\nhere treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle\nthat prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate\ncar, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first\nplace, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is\nstill in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that\nhappened within the last two years.It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one\nof the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\nbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from\nthe shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the\njurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.\nHolding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal\nemoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment\nhis. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.\nBecause the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his\nperquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of\nthem."

  "content": "Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their\ntrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their\nfat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from the\nprecious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their\nwives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their\nrespective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and\ncharitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and\nlaying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my\nmasters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’s.” Upon this\nthe poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so truly\nEnglish—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their\nheads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the\nstranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the\nhard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At\nlength one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made\nbold to speak,“Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”“The Duke.”“But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”“It is his.”“We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all\nthat to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our\npains but our blisters?”“It is his.”“Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\ngetting a livelihood?”“It is his.”“I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of\nthis whale.”“It is his.”“Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”“It is his.”In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\nWellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular\nlights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\ndeemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman\nof the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to\ntake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To\nwhich my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)\nthat he had already done so, and received the money, and would be\nobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend\ngentleman) would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this\nthe still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three\nkingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke\nto the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs\ninquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested\nwith that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon\ngives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs\nto the King and Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the\nsoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\nmatters.But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason\nfor that, ye lawyers!"

  "content": "In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench\nauthor, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s,\nthat ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this\nwas written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or\nRight whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is\nnot in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a\nsagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be\npresented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale\nand the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and\nnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I\nknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by\ninference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\nway as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head\npeculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be\nhumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there\nseems a reason in all things, even in law.CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.“In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\nLeviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” _Sir T. Browne,\nV.E._It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when\nwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the\nmany noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than\nthe three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell\nwas smelt in the sea.“I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are\nsome of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they\nwould keel up before long.”"

  "content": "Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\nlay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must\nbe alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours\nfrom his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that\ncircled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the\nwhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that\nis, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an\nunappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor\nsuch a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,\nwhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable\nindeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to\nmoor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;\nnotwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of\na very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of\nattar-of-rose.Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\nhad a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of\na nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those\nproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of\nprodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies\nalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the\nproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up\nhis nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted\nwhales in general.The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\nrecognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\nknotted round the tail of one of these whales."

I well know that these Crappoes\nof Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering\ntheir boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,\nand sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of\ntallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they\nwill get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all\nknow these things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with\nour leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too\nwith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.\nPoor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a\npresent of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get\nfrom that drugged whale there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no,\nnot in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to\nget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,\nthan he’ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of\nit, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,\nambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s worth\ntrying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the\nquarter-deck.By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\nor no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope\nof escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,\nStubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.\nDrawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the\nfanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in\nthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for\nthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole\nterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon\nher head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de\nRose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this\naromatic ship.Though Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,\nyet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\nsufficiently explained the whole to him.“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will\ndo very well; but how like all creation it smells!”Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\nhad to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\nto the blasted whale; and so talk over it.Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\nbawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that\nspeak English?”“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\nthe chief-mate.“Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”“_What_ whale?”“The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?“Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”“Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\nover the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two\nhands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab\nretired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman."

It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t\nit? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will\nye, Bouton-de-Rose?”“What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,\nflying into a sudden passion.“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those\nwhales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do\nyou know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\nsuch whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his\nwhole carcase.”“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe\nit; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\ncome aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll\nget out of this dirty scrape.”“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,\nand with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\npresented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\nrather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\nhumor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\njib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\nto the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\nthe plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\nnostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\noff at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\nconstantly filled their olfactories."

This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\nto the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\npest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\nindignations at times.Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who\nhad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\nSounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\nhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\nheld his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\nconfidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\nof theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,\nwas to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\nas for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\nin him during the interview.By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\nsmall and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\nlarge whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet\nvest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now\npolitely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put\non the aspect of interpreting between them.“What shall I say to him first?” said he.“Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you\nmay as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\nthough I don’t pretend to be a judge.”“He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\ncaptain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\nand chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\nblasted whale they had brought alongside.”Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.“What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb."

In fact, tell him from me he’s a\nbaboon.”“He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\nis far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures\nus, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\ncrew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\nloose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.“What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\nthem.“Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact,\ntell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody\nelse.”“He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to\nus.”Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\n(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into\nhis cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.“He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.“Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink\nwith the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”“He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking;\nbut that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur\nhad best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,\nfor it’s so calm they won’t drift.”By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\nthe Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his\nboat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the\nlighter whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s\nboats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb\nbenevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously\nslacking out a most unusually long tow-line."

  "content": "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\nhoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while\nthe Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb\nquickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give\nnotice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his\nunrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an\nexcavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost\nhave thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at\nlength his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up\nold Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew\nwere all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking\nas anxious as gold-hunters.And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\nscreaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\nto look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,\nwhen suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a\nfaint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells\nwithout being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then\nalong with another, without at all blending with it for a time.“I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\nin the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\nsomething that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\ncheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with\nyour thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,\ngood friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\ndruggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\nlost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were\nit not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come\non board, else the ship would bid them good bye.CHAPTER 92. Ambergris."

  "content": "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an\narticle of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\nCoffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\nsubject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\nthe precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\nto the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound\nfor grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,\nthough at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far\ninland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\nBesides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,\nused for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris\nis soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely\nused in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\npomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for\nthe same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.\nSome wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\nregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\nsick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\ncause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to\ncure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\nthree or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of\nharm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\ncertain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be\nsailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were\nnothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\nfound in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\nsaying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\nhow that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise\ncall to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the\nbest musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\nill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is\nthe worst.I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\ncannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\nwhalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\nmight be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\nof the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\naspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is\nthroughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\nrebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this\nodious stigma originate?"
