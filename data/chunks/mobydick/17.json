  "content": "The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a\nmob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,\ntumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no\nprudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous\nlad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,\nand when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about\nin quest of settlements, that is, harems.Another point of difference between the male and female schools is\nstill more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a\nForty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a\nmember of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with\nevery token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as\nthemselves to fall a prey.CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\nfishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,\na whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed\nand captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised\nmany minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For\nexample,—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the\nbody may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and\ndrifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a\ncalm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the\nmost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the\nfishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,\nundisputed law applicable to all cases.Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\nenactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in\nA.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\nlaw, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and\nlawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\ncomprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the\nChinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s\nBusiness. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,\nor the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they."

A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\nbrevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to\nexpound it.First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,\nwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at\nall controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a\nnine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the\nsame. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\nother recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it\nplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well\nas their intention so to do.These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and\nhonorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where\nit would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\npossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But\nothers are by no means so scrupulous."

  "content": "Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated\nin England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of\na whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had\nsucceeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of\ntheir lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\nitself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\nwith the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\nbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\nremonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’\nteeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\ndone, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore\nthe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,\nline, harpoons, and boat.Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\njudge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to\nillustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\nwherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s\nviciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\nthe course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\nrecover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then\nsupported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\nharpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\nher; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then\nbecame that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever\nharpoon might have been found sticking in her.Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the\nwhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very\nlearned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he\nawarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to\nsave their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,\nharpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because\nit was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons\nand line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\nacquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\ntook the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took\nthe fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs."

But ploughed up to the primary rock of the\nmatter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws\npreviously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in\nthe above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,\nI say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human\njurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of\nsculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,\nhas but two props to stand on.Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:\nthat is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often\npossession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of\nRussian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession\nis the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s\nlast mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain’s marble\nmansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?\nWhat is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor\nWoebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from\nstarvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the\nArchbishop of Savesoul’s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread\nand cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure\nof heaven without any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular\n£100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary\ntowns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer,\nJohn Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic\nlancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all\nthese, is not Possession the whole of the law?But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the\nkindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is\ninternationally and universally applicable.What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the\nSpanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and\nmistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What\nIndia to England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All\nLoose-Fish."

Heads or Tails.“De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”\n_Bracton, l. 3, c. 3._Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the\ncontext, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of\nthat land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,\nand the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division\nwhich, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no\nintermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to\nthis day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects a\nstrange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is\nhere treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle\nthat prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate\ncar, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first\nplace, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is\nstill in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that\nhappened within the last two years.It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one\nof the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\nbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from\nthe shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the\njurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.\nHolding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal\nemoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment\nhis. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.\nBecause the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his\nperquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of\nthem."

  "content": "Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their\ntrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their\nfat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from the\nprecious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their\nwives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their\nrespective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and\ncharitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and\nlaying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my\nmasters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’s.” Upon this\nthe poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so truly\nEnglish—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their\nheads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the\nstranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the\nhard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At\nlength one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made\nbold to speak,“Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”“The Duke.”“But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”“It is his.”“We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all\nthat to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our\npains but our blisters?”“It is his.”“Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\ngetting a livelihood?”“It is his.”“I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of\nthis whale.”“It is his.”“Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”“It is his.”In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\nWellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular\nlights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\ndeemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman\nof the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to\ntake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To\nwhich my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)\nthat he had already done so, and received the money, and would be\nobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend\ngentleman) would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this\nthe still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three\nkingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke\nto the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs\ninquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested\nwith that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon\ngives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs\nto the King and Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the\nsoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\nmatters.But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason\nfor that, ye lawyers!"

  "content": "In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench\nauthor, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s,\nthat ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this\nwas written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or\nRight whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is\nnot in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a\nsagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be\npresented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale\nand the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and\nnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I\nknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by\ninference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\nway as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head\npeculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be\nhumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there\nseems a reason in all things, even in law.CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.“In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\nLeviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” _Sir T. Browne,\nV.E._It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when\nwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the\nmany noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than\nthe three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell\nwas smelt in the sea.“I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are\nsome of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they\nwould keel up before long.”"

  "content": "Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\nlay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must\nbe alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours\nfrom his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that\ncircled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the\nwhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that\nis, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an\nunappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor\nsuch a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,\nwhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable\nindeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to\nmoor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;\nnotwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of\na very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of\nattar-of-rose.Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\nhad a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of\na nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those\nproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of\nprodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies\nalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the\nproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up\nhis nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted\nwhales in general.The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\nrecognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\nknotted round the tail of one of these whales."

I well know that these Crappoes\nof Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering\ntheir boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,\nand sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of\ntallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they\nwill get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all\nknow these things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with\nour leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too\nwith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.\nPoor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a\npresent of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get\nfrom that drugged whale there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no,\nnot in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to\nget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,\nthan he’ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of\nit, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,\nambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s worth\ntrying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the\nquarter-deck.By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\nor no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope\nof escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,\nStubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.\nDrawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the\nfanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in\nthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for\nthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole\nterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon\nher head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de\nRose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this\naromatic ship.Though Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,\nyet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\nsufficiently explained the whole to him.“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will\ndo very well; but how like all creation it smells!”Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\nhad to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\nto the blasted whale; and so talk over it.Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\nbawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that\nspeak English?”“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\nthe chief-mate.“Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”“_What_ whale?”“The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?“Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”“Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\nover the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two\nhands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab\nretired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman."

It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t\nit? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will\nye, Bouton-de-Rose?”“What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,\nflying into a sudden passion.“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those\nwhales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do\nyou know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\nsuch whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his\nwhole carcase.”“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe\nit; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\ncome aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll\nget out of this dirty scrape.”“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,\nand with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\npresented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\nrather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\nhumor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\njib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\nto the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\nthe plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\nnostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\noff at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\nconstantly filled their olfactories."

This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\nto the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\npest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\nindignations at times.Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who\nhad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\nSounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\nhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\nheld his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\nconfidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\nof theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,\nwas to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\nas for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\nin him during the interview.By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\nsmall and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\nlarge whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet\nvest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now\npolitely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put\non the aspect of interpreting between them.“What shall I say to him first?” said he.“Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you\nmay as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\nthough I don’t pretend to be a judge.”“He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\ncaptain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\nand chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\nblasted whale they had brought alongside.”Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.“What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb."

In fact, tell him I must go.”“He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking;\nbut that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur\nhad best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,\nfor it’s so calm they won’t drift.”By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\nthe Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his\nboat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the\nlighter whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s\nboats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb\nbenevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously\nslacking out a most unusually long tow-line."

You would almost\nhave thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at\nlength his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up\nold Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew\nwere all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking\nas anxious as gold-hunters.And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\nscreaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\nto look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,\nwhen suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a\nfaint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells\nwithout being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then\nalong with another, without at all blending with it for a time.“I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\nin the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\nsomething that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\ncheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with\nyour thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,\ngood friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\ndruggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\nlost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were\nit not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come\non board, else the ship would bid them good bye.CHAPTER 92. Ambergris."

  "content": "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an\narticle of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\nCoffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\nsubject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\nthe precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\nto the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound\nfor grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,\nthough at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far\ninland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\nBesides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,\nused for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris\nis soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely\nused in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\npomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for\nthe same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.\nSome wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\nregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\nsick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\ncause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to\ncure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\nthree or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of\nharm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\ncertain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be\nsailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were\nnothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\nfound in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\nsaying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\nhow that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise\ncall to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the\nbest musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\nill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is\nthe worst.I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\ncannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\nwhalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\nmight be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\nof the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\naspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is\nthroughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\nrebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this\nodious stigma originate?"

  "content": "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\nGreenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\nthose whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea\nas the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh\nblubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,\nand carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those\nIcy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,\nforbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking\ninto the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the\nGreenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\nfrom excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a\nLying-in Hospital.I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\nlikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\ntimes, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\nlatter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\nwork on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports\n(smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to\nafford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried\nout, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\ncollection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works\nwere in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But\nall this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a\nvoyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with\noil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling\nout; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.\nThe truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a\nspecies are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be\nrecognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew\nin the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be\notherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high\nhealth; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it\nis true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm\nWhale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented\nlady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the\nSperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be\nto that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,\nwhich was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great?CHAPTER 93. The Castaway."

As a general\nthing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising\nthe boats’ crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,\nor timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a\nship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by\nnick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;\nye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so\ngloomy-jolly."

  "content": "In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and\na white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven\nin one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull\nand torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at\nbottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness\npeculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and\nfestivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks,\nthe year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five\nFourth of Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that\nthis little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;\nbehold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved\nlife, and all life’s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking\nbusiness in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had\nmost sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,\nwhat was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be\nluridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him\noff to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland\nCounty in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on\nthe green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned\nthe round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the\nclear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\npure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\njeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\nlays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,\nbut by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,\ninfernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest\nsymbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from\nthe King of Hell. But let us to the story.It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman\nchanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\nand, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\nbut happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\ntherefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\nhim, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\nto the utmost, for he might often find it needful.Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\nthe fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\nhappened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The\ninvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\nhand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\nline coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\nto become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\ninstant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\nstraightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\nthe boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\nseveral turns around his chest and neck.Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\nhated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he\nsuspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\nexclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face\nplainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than\nhalf a minute, this entire thing happened.“Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\nsaved."

  "content": "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by\nyells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\nirregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\nbut still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\nunofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\njump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the\nsoundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your\ntrue motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from\nthe boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if\nhe should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be\nleaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly\ndropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to\nthe boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind\nthat. We can’t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would\nsell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in\nmind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,\nthat though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,\nwhich propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\nunder very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this\ntime he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started\nto run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s\ntrunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,\nbounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly\nstretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin\nhammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s\nebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when\nhe fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him;\nand the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless\nocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor\nPip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely\ncastaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\npractised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\nlonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\nmiddle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,\nhow when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely\nthey hug their ship and only coast along her sides.But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;\nhe did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\nand he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip\nvery quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations\ntowards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always\nmanifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances\nnot unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\ncalled, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\nmilitary navies and armies."

By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\nbut from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,\nat least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\nup, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.\nRather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\nthe unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;\nand the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the\njoyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\nGod-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters\nheaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the\nloom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So\nman’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,\nman comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\nabsurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,\nindifferent as his God.For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that\nfishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what\nlike abandonment befell myself.CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the\nPequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations\npreviously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of\nthe Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in\ndragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and\nwhen the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated\nere going to the try-works, of which anon.It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with\nseveral others, I sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I\nfound it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about\nin the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back\ninto fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this\nsperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener!\nsuch a softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it\nfor only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it\nwere, to serpentine and spiralise."

Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving\nfeeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually\nsqueezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as\nmuch as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish\nany social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;\nlet us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into\neach other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and\nsperm of kindness.Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since\nby many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all\ncases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of\nattainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the\nfancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the\nfireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready\nto squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I\nsaw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of\nspermaceti.Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things\nakin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the\ntry-works.First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering\npart of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It\nis tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some\noil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut\ninto portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like\nblocks of Berkshire marble."
