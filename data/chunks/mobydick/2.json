  "content": "It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\nNantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky\nlight of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who\nhad gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But\nsomehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine\nchance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an\nimmortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a\nspeechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what\nthen? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.\nMethinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true\nsubstance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too\nmuch like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking\nthat thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees\nof my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is\nnot me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat\nand stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\nrobustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\nadmitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\nsufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it\nwas the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\nwas a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\nhis youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\nministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\nwinter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\ninto a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his\nwrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing\nbloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No\none having previously heard his history, could for the first time\nbehold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were\ncertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that\nadventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that\nhe carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\nhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\ncloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\nthe water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one\nby one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\nwhen, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit."

  "content": "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side\nladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife\nof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\nred worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely\nheaded, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad\ntaste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both\nhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple\ncast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still\nreverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if\nascending the main-top of his vessel.The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of\nwood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of\nthe pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\nthese joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\nprepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\nround, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\nstep by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\nimpregnable in his little Quebec.I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\nsanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\nmere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\nCan it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\nhis spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\nand connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\nself-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial\nwell of water within the walls."

  "content": "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\nborrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\nbreakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\nfloated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s\nface; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\nship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\nthe Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel\nseemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\nhelm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\noff—serenest azure is at hand.”Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\nlikeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed\nbeak.What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s\nforemost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the\nworld. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first\ndescried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is\nthe God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.\nYes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;\nand the pulpit is its prow.CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered\nthe scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away\nto larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\nstill slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and\nevery eye on the preacher.He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\nat the bottom of the sea.This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a\nbell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—“The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,\n  While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down\n  to doom.“I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;\n  Which none but they that feel can tell— Oh, I was plunging to\n  despair."

  "content": "“In black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him\n  mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints— No more the whale did me\n  confine.“With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;\n  Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.“My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I\n  give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.”Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\nhowling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon\nthe proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the\nfirst chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\nJonah.’”“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one\nof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what\ndepths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\nlesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\nthe fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\nfloods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_\nis this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a\ntwo-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to\nme as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\nawakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\nthe deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\nsin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\ncommand of God—never mind now what that command was, or how\nconveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God\nwould have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we\nmust disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein\nthe hardness of obeying God consists."

  "content": "“With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\nCaptains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks\na ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto\nunheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no\nother city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from\nJoppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when\nthe Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\nJaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,\nthe Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\nwestward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not\nthen, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\nMiserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\ndisordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\nin those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had\nbeen arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no\nbaggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him\nto the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\nfinds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as\nhe steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for\nthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s\nevil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the\nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but\nstill serious way, one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a\nwidow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I\nguess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,\none of the missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill\nthat’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\nmoored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\nparricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and\nlooks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\ncrowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\nitself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\npass, and he descends into the cabin."

For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\nBut he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\nsail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\nthough the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\nhollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the\nnext coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing\nhim. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\npassenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away\nthe Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage\nmoney how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,\nshipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,\n‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with\nthe context, this is full of meaning."

In\nthis world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\nwithout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\nfrontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s\npurse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\nand it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\nstill molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\npassage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m\ntravel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’ says the Captain,\n‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock\ncontains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain\nlaughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of\nconvicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\nand dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\nlittle state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\nclose, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\nbeneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\nof that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\nhis bowels’ wards.“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\noscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\nhung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the\nceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in\nme!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\nsoul are all in crookedness!’“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\nRoman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;\nas one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\nanguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at\nlast amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as\nover the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and\nthere’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,\nJonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep."

That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded\nsmugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not\nbear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to\nbreak. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when\nboxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is\nshrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\ntrampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,\nJonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\nrush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving\nthe seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides\nof the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast\nasleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead\near, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy\nby that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the\ndeck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he\nis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave\nafter wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs\nroaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet\nafloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the\nsteep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\nbowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\ntormented deep.“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to\nhigh Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\ngreat tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then\nhow furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine\noccupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,\nmy shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask\nhim who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer\nto those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put\nby them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard\nhand of God that is upon him.“‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven\nwho hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well\nmightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to\nmake a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\nappalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating\nGod for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\ndeserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\nforth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\nwas upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means\nto save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;\nthen, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not\nunreluctantly lay hold of Jonah."

He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\nthe yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\nteeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed\nunto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and\nlearn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and\nwail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is\njust. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with\nthis, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards\nHis holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;\nnot clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing\nto God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance\nof him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah\nbefore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a\nmodel for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it\nlike Jonah.”While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\nwhen describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his\nsimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\nleaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with\nclosed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,\nwith an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these\nwords:"

And now how gladly would I come\ndown from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,\nand listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other\nand more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to _me_, as a pilot of the\nliving God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true\nthings, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the\nears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should\nraise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God\nby taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never\nreached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed\nhim down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him\nalong ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him\nten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’\nand all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond\nthe reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale\ngrounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the\nengulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the\nfish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale\ncame breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the\ndelights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’\nwhen the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and\nbeaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring\nof the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that,\nshipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!“This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\nthe living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from\nGospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God\nhas brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than\nto appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe\nto him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would\nnot be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him\nwho, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is\nhimself a castaway!”"

Is not the main-truck higher than\nthe kelson is low?

A Bosom Friend.Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\nquite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some\ntime. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the\nstove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that\nlittle negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a\njack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to\nhimself in his heathenish way.But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going\nto the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap\nbegan counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth\npage—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and\ngiving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He\nwould then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number\none each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was\nonly by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his\nastonishment at the multitude of pages was excited."

Savage though he was, and\nhideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance\nyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You\ncannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I\nsaw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,\nfiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\nthousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty\nbearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never\nhad had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,\nhis forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked\nmore expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to\ndecide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent\none. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s\nhead, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long\nregularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were\nlikewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on\ntop. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\nlooking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\npresence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but\nappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\nbook. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night\nprevious, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found\nthrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference\nof his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do\nnot know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their\ncalm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had\nnoticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,\nwith the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;\nappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.\nAll this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there\nwas something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand\nmiles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only\nway he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though\nhe were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;\npreserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;\nalways equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;\nthough no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,\nperhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of\nso living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man\ngives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the\ndyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”"

I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart\nand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing\nsavage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a\nnature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\ndeceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to\nfeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that\nwould have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus\ndrew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness\nhas proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some\nfriendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At\nfirst he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my\nreferring to his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me\nwhether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I\nthought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\nhim the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\nthat were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\nwent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\nbe seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\nproducing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And\nthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it\nregularly passing between us.If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\nleft us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\nunbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his\nforehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\nhenceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we\nwere bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a\ncountryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\npremature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage\nthose old rules would not apply.After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\ntogether. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\nenormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\nthirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them\ntowards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\nsilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay.\nHe then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed\nthe paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\nanxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I\ndeliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\notherwise."

But what is worship? thought I. Do you\nsuppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\nearth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an\ninsignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do\nthe will of God—_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do\nto my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me—_that_ is\nthe will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish\nthat this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular\nPresbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him\nin his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped\nprop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with\nQueequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that\ndone, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences\nand all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\ndisclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the\nvery bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often\nlie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our\nhearts’ honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\nQueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\nover mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\nand easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what\nlittle nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like\ngetting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future."

  "content": "Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\nbegan to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\nsitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\nhead-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\nnoses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt\nvery nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;\nindeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the\nroom. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some\nsmall part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world\nthat is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\nyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been\nso a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But\nif, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown\nof your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general\nconsciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For\nthis reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,\nwhich is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height\nof this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket\nbetween you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there\nyou lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\nonce I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether\nby day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\nkeeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\nbeing in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\nexcept his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper\nelement of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey\npart. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and\nself-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\nunilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\nrevulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\nperhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide\nawake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\nfrom his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong\nrepugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how\nelastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\nFor now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,\neven in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\nthen. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of\ninsurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential\ncomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.\nWith our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the\nTomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue\nhanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp."

  "content": "Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\nfar distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;\nand, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He\ngladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of\nhis words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar\nwith his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story\nsuch as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.CHAPTER 12. Biographical.Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and\nSouth. It is not down in any map; true places never are.When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\ngrass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\nsapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\ndesire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\ntwo. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\non the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\nunconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\nnourished in his untutored youth.A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a\npassage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of\nseamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence\ncould prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\noff to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\nshe quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a\nlow tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\nthe water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with\nits prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and\nwhen the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\nside; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\nclimbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\ndeck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\nhacked in pieces."

  "content": "In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\ncutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\nQueequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\nwild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\ntold him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage—this\nsea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down\namong the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\ncontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\nno seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\nenlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he\nwas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the\narts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more\nthan that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\nwhalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\nmiserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s\nheathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the\nsailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\nspent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\nlost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a\npagan.And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\nwore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\nways about him, though now some time from home.By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\na coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\nbeing very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not\nyet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,\nhad unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty\npagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as\nsoon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he\nproposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They\nhad made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\nsceptre now.I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\nmovements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\nthis, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\nintention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port\nfor an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to\naccompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the\nsame watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my\nevery hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of\nboth worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection\nI now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,\ncould not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was\nwholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted\nwith the sea, as known to merchant seamen.His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg\nembraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the\nlight, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon\nwere sleeping.CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow."

The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\namazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between\nme and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories\nabout him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\nwhom I now companied with.We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\ndown to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\nwharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\nmuch—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\nstreets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\nheeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\nnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\nasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\nhe had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\nassured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\nwith the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\nmowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own\nscythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg,\nfor his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\nthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\nowners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\nheavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\nthing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\nwhich to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\nfast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,”\nsaid I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\nthink. Didn’t the people laugh?”"

  "content": "Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\nof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\nthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\nmat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\ntouched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very\nstately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a\npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\nguests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain\nmarches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\nagainst the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\nKing, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their\ngrace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\ntimes look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying\nthe ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I\nsay, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\nceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\nconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\ncirculates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\nceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain\nprecedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own\nhouse—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\npunchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said\nQueequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\nschooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\nall glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of\ncasks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\nworld-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\nfrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises\nof fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises\nwere on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,\nfor ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness\nof all earthly effort.Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\nMoss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\nsnortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike\nearth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\nheels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea\nwhich will permit no records."
