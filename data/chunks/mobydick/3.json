He\nonly asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that\ndone, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the\nbulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to\nhimself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\ncannibals must help these Christians.”CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a\nfine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of\nthe world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely\nthan the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of\nsand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than\nyou would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\ngamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\ndon’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have\nto send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that\npieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true\ncross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,\nto get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an\noasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand\nshoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,\nbelted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island\nof by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\nsometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these\nextravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois."

In olden times an eagle\nswooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\nIndian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child\nborne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the\nsame direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage\nthey discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory\ncasket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should\ntake to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs\nin the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\nexperienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\nlaunching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\nput an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at\nBehring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\neverlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\nflood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\nMastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\nhis very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\nmalicious assaults!"

  "content": "And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\ntheir ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like\nso many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,\nand Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America\nadd Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English\noverswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;\ntwo thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea\nis his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a\nright of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges;\narmed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though\nfollowing the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,\nother fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw\ntheir living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone\nresides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to\nit in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.\n_There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood\nwould not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.\nHe lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among\nthe waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years\nhe knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells\nlike another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.\nWith the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to\nsleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight\nof land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his\nvery pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.CHAPTER 15. Chowder.It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\nanchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\nbusiness that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord\nof the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\nTry Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\nhotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\nHosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\nplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\nat the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a\nyellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to\nthe larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\nman we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\nmuch puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\ninsisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be\nleft on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say\nit was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in\nthe dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\ninquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\nmistaking."

The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\nside, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\nPerhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\ncould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort\nof crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,\n_two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks\nI. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\ntombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows!\nand a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out\noblique hints touching Tophet?I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\neye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\nshirt.“Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”“Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\npostponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\nconcluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”“What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.“Clam or Cod?” she repeated.“A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?”\nsays I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\ntime, ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\nShirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing\nbut the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading\nto the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.“Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us\nboth on one clam?”"

  "content": "However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\napparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\ncame in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\nhearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\nhazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up\ninto little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully\nseasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the\nfrosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing\nfood before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we\ndespatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and\nbethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I\nwould try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered\nthe word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few\nmoments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different\nflavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I\nto myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s\nthat stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look,\nQueequeg, ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its\nname; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\nbreakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\nbegan to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\nbefore the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account\nbooks bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the\nmilk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning\nhappening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s\nboats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and\nmarching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,\nlooking very slip-shod, I assure ye.Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to\nprecede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded\nhis harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I;\n“every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because\nit’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that\nunfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with\nonly three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,\nwith his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to\ntake sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg”\n(for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and\nkeep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow\nfor breakfast, men?”“Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of\nvariety.”"

But to my surprise and no\nsmall concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\ndiligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo\nhad told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\neveryway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\nharbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,\nYojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest\nwholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order\nto do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,\nI, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though\nit had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\nmyself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\nconfidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast\nof things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather\ngood sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in\nall cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs."

I had not a little\nrelied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\ncarry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances\nproduced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and\naccordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined\nrushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that\ntrifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up\nwith Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of\nLent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with\nQueequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,\nthough I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\nliturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\ntomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\nshavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\nsauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\nships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the\nPequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;\n_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated\ntribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I\npeered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the\nTit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for\na moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us."

She was a ship of the old\nschool, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed\nlook about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and\ncalms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a\nFrench grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her\nvenerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of\nJapan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts\nstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\nancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\nher old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\nto the wild business that for more than half a century she had\nfollowed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he\ncommanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one\nof the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term\nof his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\ninlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\nunmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or\nbedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his\nneck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of\ntrophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\nbones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\ngarnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the\nsperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews\nand tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,\nbut deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile\nwheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller\nwas in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\nhereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,\nfelt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\nits jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things\nare touched with that."

  "content": "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\nauthority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at\nfirst I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\ntent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber\nblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\nright-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\nthese slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at\nthe apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved\nto and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A\ntriangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the\ninsider commanded a complete view forward.And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\nhis aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\nship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\ncommand. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\nover with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\nstout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\nconstructed.There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\nthe elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\nand heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\nonly there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his\ncontinual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\nwindward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\ntogether. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.“Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of\nthe tent.“Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of\nhim?” he demanded."

I’ve been\nseveral voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”“Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that\nleg?—I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of\nthe marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose\nnow ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant\nships.

  "content": "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\nship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\npointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\ncould see.“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye\nsee?”“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,\nand there’s a squall coming up, I think.”“Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\nround Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where\nyou stand?”I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\nPequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now\nrepeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\nwillingness to ship me.“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come\nalong with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\ncabin.Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\neach owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\nnail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\nwhaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\nstocks bringing in good interest.Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\nthis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\npeculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by\nthings altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance."

  "content": "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\nScripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\nQuaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\nthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\nglobular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\nseclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\nbeneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\nuntraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or\nsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\nbreast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\nadvantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes\none in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for\nnoble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\nregarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\na half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For\nall men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be\nsure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.\nBut, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;\nand still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\nanother phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\nBut unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called\nserious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\nveriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally\neducated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but\nall his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely\nisland creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native\nborn Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\nvest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\nconsistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\nhad illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn\nfoe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled\ntuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening\nof his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the\nreminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\nconclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world\nquite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\ncabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a\nbroad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,\nchief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted\nbefore, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\nactive life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining\ndays to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income."

  "content": "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\ntask-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\nupon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,\nsore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\nhe was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used\nto swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\ninordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\nBildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking\nat you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch\nsomething—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at\nsomething or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished\nbefore him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\ncharacter. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\nsuperfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like\nthe worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\nwas small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\nand never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\nplaced beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\nbuttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\nreading from a ponderous volume.“Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\nstudying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\ncertain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\nand seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.“I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.“He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\nhis book in a mumbling tone quite audible."

  "content": "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\nhis friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\nnothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\nand drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him,\nand seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\nto settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for\nthe voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\nno wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares\nof the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to\nthe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\nship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my\nown lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\nsea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\nthat from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th\nlay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,\nwhatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was\nwhat they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and\nif we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I\nwould wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,\nfor which I would not have to pay one stiver.It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\nfortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\nthat never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\nworld is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this\ngrim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the\n275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been\nsurprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a\nbroad-shouldered make.But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\nsomething of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\nhow that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\nthe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\nwhole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know\nbut what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\nshipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\nquite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\nown fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\njack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he\nwas such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\nus, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay\nshall we give this young man?”“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do\ncorrupt, but _lay_—’”"

  "content": "_Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\nshall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do\ncorrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from\nthe magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\nthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\nseventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\n_teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\nhundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.“Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to\nswindle this young man! he must have more than that.”“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting\nhis eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there\nwill your heart be also.”“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do\nye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n“Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\nduty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,\nmany of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\nyoung man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\norphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\ncabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\nmatters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\nheavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\nHorn.”“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing\nten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art\nstill an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering\ndown to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”“Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\ninsult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\nhe’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\nand start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat\nwith all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\ndrab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\nmarvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him."

  "content": "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\nidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\nI made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\nwrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\ntransom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\nwithdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\nlittle as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the\nsquall’s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\nsharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\nthe grindstone. That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\nIshmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\nfor the three hundredth lay.”“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship\ntoo—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”“To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\nwhich he had again been burying himself.“Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever\nwhaled it any?” turning to me.“Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”“Well, bring him along then.”And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\nhad done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical\nship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\nCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\nindeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and\nreceive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by\narriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,\nand the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the\ncaptain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he\ndoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to\nthe owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to\nhave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his\nhands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\nAhab was to be found.“And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou\nart shipped.”“Yes, but I should like to see him.”"

In fact, he ain’t\nsick; but no, he isn’t well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always\nsee me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain\nAhab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well enough; no\nfear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;\ndoesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.\nMark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s above the common; Ahab’s been in\ncolleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders\nthan the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than\nwhales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our\nisle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain’t Captain Peleg;\n_he’s Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”“And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\nthey not lick his blood?”“Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in\nhis eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board\nthe Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.\n’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died\nwhen he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at\nGayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,\nperhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn\nthee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed with him as\nmate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man,\nlike Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a\ngood deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;\nand I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind\nfor a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump\nthat brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever\nsince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a\nkind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all\npass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young\nman, it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\none. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens\nto have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages\nwedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that\nold man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm\nin Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his\nhumanities!”"

And somehow, at the time,\nI felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what,\nunless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange\nawe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\nnot exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\nnot disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed\nlike mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.\nHowever, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so\nthat for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.As Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all\nday, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I\ncherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,\nnever mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue\neven a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other\ncreatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of\nfootmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the\ntorso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the\ninordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\nthings, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\npagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\nsubjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg\nthought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;\nand there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let\nhim be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans\nalike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and\nsadly need mending."

I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\n“Queequeg,” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say,\nQueequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still\nas before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant\ntime; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through\nthe key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the\nkey-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see\npart of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing\nmore. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden\nshaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous\nhad taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That’s strange,\nthought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he\nseldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside\nhere, and no possible mistake.“Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.\nApoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\nRunning down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person\nI met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must\nbe the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was\nlocked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever\nsince. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your\nbaggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.\nHussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I\nfollowing.Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\nvinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation\nof attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy\nmeantime.“Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch\nsomething to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a stroke;\ndepend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs\nagain empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and\nvinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.“What’s the matter with you, young man?”“Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry\nit open!”“Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,\nso as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying\nopen any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the\nmatter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”"
