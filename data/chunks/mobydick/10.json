  "content": "Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\nt’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The\nbest man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head\nmanned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,\nupheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows\nof so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air\nbeneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic\ninfluences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the\nother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched\nAhab’s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two\ndifferent things were warring. While his one live leg made lively\nechoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a\ncoffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship\nso swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager\nglances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every\nsailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days\nafter, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it\nwas descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it\ndisappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after\nnight, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted\ninto the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;\ndisappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and\nsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still\nfurther and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever\nalluring us on.Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance\nwith the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested\nthe Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that\nwhenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however\nfar apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by\none self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there\nreigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as\nif it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the\nmonster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest\nand most savage seas.These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a\nwondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in\nwhich, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a\ndevilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so\nwearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful\nerrand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow."

And\nevery morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and\nspite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,\nas though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a\nthing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for\ntheir homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved\nthe black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great\nmundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering\nit had bred.Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called\nof yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had\nattended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where\nguilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed\ncondemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat\nthat black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and\nunvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still\nbeckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be\ndescried."

In tempestuous times like these, after everything\nabove and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but\npassively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become\npractical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its\naccustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for\nhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\neyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of\nthe ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,\nstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to\nguard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\nsort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened\nbelt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by\npainted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift\nmadness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness\nof humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence\nthe men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the\nblast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not\nseek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old\nman’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the\nbarometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his\nfloor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from\nwhich he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the\nunremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of\nthose charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken\nof. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body\nwas erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were\npointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in\nthe ceiling.*"

The Albatross.South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising\nground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)\nby name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the\nfore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro\nin the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\nskeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral\nappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all\nher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred\nover with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it\nwas to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They\nseemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment\nthat had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops\nnailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and\nthough, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men\nin the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped\nfrom the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those\nforlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not\none word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being\nheard from below.“Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”"

Meantime his ship was still increasing\nthe distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the\nPequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the\nfirst mere mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for\na moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a\nboat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But\ntaking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,\nand knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer\nand shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the\nPequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters\nto the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,\ntell them to address them to ——”At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,\nin accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,\nthat for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,\ndarted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves\nfore and aft with the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his\ncontinual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar\nsight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously\ncarry meanings.“Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.\nThere seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of\ndeep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.\nBut turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in\nthe wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion\nvoice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round the world!”Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;\nbut whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through\nnumberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that\nwe left behind secure, were all the time before us.Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for\never reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange\nthan any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise\nin the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in\ntormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims\nbefore all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they\neither lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.CHAPTER 53.

  "content": "The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\nspoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this\nnot been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded\nher—judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had\nbeen that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer\nto the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not\nto consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he\ncould contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But\nall this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said\nhere of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other\nin foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\nequally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering\neach other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of\nthem, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment\nto interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and\nresting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the\nillimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling\nvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—off lone\nFanning’s Island, or the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural,\nI say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only\ninterchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\nsociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of\ncourse, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose\ncaptains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to\neach other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to\ntalk about."

And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound\nship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\ncruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost\nimportance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\nwhaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the cruising-ground\nitself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of\nthem may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now\nfar remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of\nthe ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,\nand have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the\nsympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar\ncongenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared\nprivations and perils.Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;\nthat is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case\nwith Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number\nof English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when\nthey do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;\nfor your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not\nfancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English\nwhalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the\nAmerican whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his\nnondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this\nsuperiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be\nhard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill\nmore whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this\nis a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the\nNantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows\nthat he has a few foibles himself."

  "content": "So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\nwhalers have most reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some\nmerchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will\noftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,\nmutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies\nin Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism\nupon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at\nsea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and\nscrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be\nmuch right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As\ntouching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,\nthey run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,\nwhen they chance to cross each other’s cross-bones, the first hail\nis—“How many skulls?”—the same way that whalers hail—“How many\nbarrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer\napart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don’t like to\nsee overmuch of each other’s villanous likenesses.But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another\nwhaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “_Gam_,” a thing so\nutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\neven; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,\nand repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and\nsuch like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and\nalso all Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish\nsuch a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it\nwould be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should\nlike to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory\nabout it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at\nthe gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,\nhe has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I\nconclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,\nin that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.But what is a _Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up\nand down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr.\nJohnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not\nhold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years\nbeen in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees.\nCertainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the\nLexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.GAM. NOUN—_A social meeting of two_ (_or more_) _Whaleships, generally\non a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange\nvisits by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on\nboard of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other._"

  "content": "There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten\nhere. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\nhas the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the\ncaptain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern\nsheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often\nsteers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with\ngay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa\nof that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if\nwhaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old\naldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never\nadmits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete\nboat’s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or\nharpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the\noccasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to\nhis visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that\nbeing conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him\nfrom the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to\nthe importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor\nis this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting\nsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the\nafter-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus\ncompletely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself\nsideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent\npitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a\nspread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,\nit would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would\nnever do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying\nhimself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his\nhands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he\ngenerally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being\ngenerally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.\nNevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones\ntoo, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment\nor two, in a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s\nhair, and hold on there like grim death."

The Town-Ho’s Story.(_As told at the Golden Inn._)The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is\nmuch like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet\nmore travellers than in any other part.It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\nhomeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned\nalmost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us\nstrong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White\nWhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho’s\nstory, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain\nwondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of\nGod which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter\ncircumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may\nbe called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never\nreached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of\nthe story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the\nprivate property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of\nwhom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of\nsecrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and\nrevealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could\nnot well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did\nthis thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full\nknowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were\nthey governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among\nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s main-mast.\nInterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as\npublicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now\nproceed to put on lasting record.*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,\nstill used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin."

Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were\non the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they\noccasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.“Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,\nwas cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward\nfrom the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the\nnorthward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according\nto daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold\nthan common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But\nthe captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good\nluck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to\nquit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,\nthough, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low\ndown as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued\nher cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy\nintervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was\nthe leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that\nnow taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the\nnearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and\nrepaired.“Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\nfavoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the\nway, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically\nrelieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the\nship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well\nnigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous\nbreezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at\nher port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been\nfor the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the\nbitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from\nBuffalo."

Now,\ngentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\nlarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\nManilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet\nbeen nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly\nconnected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,\nthose grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\nSuperior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many\nof the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of\nraces and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic\nisles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by\ntwo great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long\nmaritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,\ndotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by\nbatteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they\nhave heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they\nyield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash\nfrom out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\nancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried\nlines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild\nAfric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give\nrobes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and\nCleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the\nfull-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,\nand the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as\ndireful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks\nare, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full\nmany a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,\nthough an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean\nnurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,\nthough in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket\nbeach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long\nfollowed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was\nhe quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods\nseaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet\nwas this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this\nLakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by\ninflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human\nrecognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this\nSteelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he\nhad proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and\nSteelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear."

So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was\non this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they\nstood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear\nwater; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the\npumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at\nthe lee scupper-holes.“Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\nworld of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command\nover his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his\nsuperior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\nconceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a\nchance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make\na little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,\ngentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\nhead like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled\nhousings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a\nheart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt\nCharlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne’s father. But Radney,\nthe mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.\nHe did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.“Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\nrest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with\nhis gay banterings.“‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\none of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I\ntell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut\naway his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that\nsword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of\nship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole\nposse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;\nmaking improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him\nto jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his\nestate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty\ntoo. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\nlooking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model\nof his nose.’"

Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\nto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\nnot; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\ncommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\nshovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\npig to run at large.“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household\nwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\nevening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\nfoundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\nsea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\nwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\nvessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\nif boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\nTown-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;\nand being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been\nregularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should\nhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly\nnautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all\nthese particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair\nstood between the two men."

Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\nunderstand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\nstill for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s\nmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\nand the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\ninstinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\nto stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a\nrepugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when\naggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over\nSteelkilt.“Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\nthe deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,\nwithout at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the\ncustomary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\nlittle or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a\nmost domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\ncommand; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\nuplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\nby.“Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\nall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\ncould but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\nsmothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\ndoggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\nhammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\nhis bidding.“Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\nhis intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\nnot the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\nhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\nwas to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the\nwindlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him\nthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\nLakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:"

Take that hammer away, or look to\nyourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\nthe Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\nhis teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\nRetreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\nwith the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his\nright hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\npersecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\nmurder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\nby the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\nthe lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch\nspouting blood like a whale.“Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\nleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\nmastheads. They were both Canallers.“‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our\nharbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are\nthey?’“‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.\nYou must have heard of it.’“‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary\nland, we know but little of your vigorous North.’“‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere\nproceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such\ninformation may throw side-light upon my story.’“For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire\nbreadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and\nmost thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and\naffluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room\nand bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman\narches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or\nbroken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk\ncounties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires\nstand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly\ncorrupt and often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;\nthere howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.\nFor by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan\nfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so\nsinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.“‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the\ncrowded plazza, with humorous concern.“‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in\nLima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’"

Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name of all\nus Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by\nno means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for\ndistant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look\nsurprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as Lima.”\nIt but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than\nbilliard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt as Lima.” So, too,\nVenice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.\nMark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you\npour out again.’“Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would\nmake a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\nhe. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery\nNile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked\nCleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,\nall this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller\nso proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his\ngrand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\nthrough which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not\nunshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received\ngood turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would\nfain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming\nqualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm\nto back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In\nsum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\nemphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so\nmany of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of\nmankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling\ncaptains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,\nthat to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its\nline, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole\ntransition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and\nrecklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.“‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha\nupon his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I\nhad thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were\ncold and holy as the hills.—But the story.’"

Hardly\nhad he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and\nthe four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down\nthe ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the\nuproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.\nOthers of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted\nturmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’s way, the valiant captain\ndanced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to\nmanhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the\nquarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of\nthe confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to\nprick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his\ndesperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the\nforecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks\nin a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves\nbehind the barricade.“‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing them\nwith a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come\nout of that, ye cut-throats!’“Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,\ndefied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to\nunderstand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal\nfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart\nlest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but\nstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.“‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their\nringleader.“‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to\nsink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and he\nonce more raised a pistol.“‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us\nturns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What\nsay ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their\nresponse.“The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye\non the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our\nfault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was\nboy’s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to\nprick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his\ncursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,\nmen? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to\nyourself; say the word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to\nturn to; treat us decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be\nflogged.’“‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’"

Down ye go.’“‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against\nit; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down\ninto their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.“As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain\nand his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide\nof the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called\nfor the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the\ncompanionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered\nsomething down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten\nin number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had\nremained neutral.“All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and\naft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at\nwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\nbreaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed\nin peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the\npumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary\nnight dismally resounded through the ship."

Water was\nthen lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were\ntossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,\nthe Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three\ndays this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,\nand then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;\nand suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were\nready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,\nunited perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained\nthem to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a\nterrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he\nbelonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up\ninto the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain\nthem. Only three were left.“‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.“‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.“‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.“It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\nseven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had\nlast hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as\nblack as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to\nthe two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst\nout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with\ntheir keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a\nhandle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if\nby any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For\nhimself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.\nThat was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met\nwith no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were\nready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a\nsurrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first\nman on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this\ntheir leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;\nparticularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,\nin the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder\nwould but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play\nof these miscreants must come out."
