  "content": "But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\nchat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\nthen ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\ntop-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\nat last mount to my ultimate destination.Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\nbut sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\ncould I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\naltitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\nwhale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out\nevery time.”And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\nNantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\nlean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who\noffers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware\nof such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be\nkilled; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes\nround the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor\nare these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery\nfurnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded\nyoung men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches\nhimself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,\nand in moody phrase ejaculates:—“Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand\nblubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”"

  "content": "Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\nphilosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\n“interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost\nto all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would\nrather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young\nPlatonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are\nshort-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have\nleft their opera-glasses at home.“Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been\ncruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale\nyet. Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.”\nPerhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in\nthe far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of\nvacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending\ncadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;\ntakes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,\nblue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,\nhalf-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every\ndimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him\nthe embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by\ncontinually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit\nebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;\nlike Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of\nevery shore the round globe over.There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\ngently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from\nthe inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on\nye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your\nidentity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And\nperhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled\nshriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no\nmore to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.(_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning\nshortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\ncabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that\nhour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in\nthe garden."

Did\nyou fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,\nyou would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one\nunsleeping, ever-pacing thought.But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his\nnervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his\nthought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the\nmain-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought\nturn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely\npossessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of\nevery outer movement.“D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks\nthe shell. ’Twill soon be out.”The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the\ndeck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\nbulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\nwith one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody\naft.“Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\nship-board except in some extraordinary case.“Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not\nwholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike\nthe weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly\nglancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,\nstarted from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him\nresumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched\nhat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among\nthe men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have\nsummoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.\nBut this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed\nvoices."

  "content": "“Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\nhearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\nthrown them.“And what do ye next, men?”“Lower away, and after him!”“And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”“A dead whale or a stove boat!”More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\ncountenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to\ngaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they\nthemselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\nalmost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\nwhale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a\nbroad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye\nsee it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\nto heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly\nhumming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\nvitality in him.Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\nwith the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the\nother, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises\nme a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;\nwhosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes\npunctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me\nthat same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”“Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\ntopmaul: “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”"

Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have\nseen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”“Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far\nbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\nstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain\nAhab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off\nthy leg?”"

Aye, aye,” he shouted\nwith a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;\n“Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor\npegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with\nmeasureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him\nround Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,\nand round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye\nhave shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,\nand over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin\nout. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do\nlook brave.”“Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\nexcited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for\nMoby Dick!”“God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye,\nmen. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long\nface about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not\ngame for Moby Dick?”“I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\nAhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I\ncame here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many\nbarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\nAhab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”“Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\nlittle lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,\nlet me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_”“He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it\nrings most vast, but hollow.”“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee\nfrom blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,\nCaptain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”"

But in each event—in the living act, the\nundoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth\nthe mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\nwill strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach\noutside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is\nthat wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond.\nBut ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous\nstrength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable\nthing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the\nwhite whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me\nof blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the\nsun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of\nfair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\nmaster, man, is even that fair play.

Look! see yonder\nTurkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by\nthe sun.

Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one\ntost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to\nhelp strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From\nthis one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely\nhe will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a\nwhetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!\nSpeak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.\n(_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in\nhis lungs.

  "content": "“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\ndid not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the\nhold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor\nyet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment\ntheir hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up\nwith the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the\nwinds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as\nbefore. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?\nBut rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so\nmuch predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things\nwithin. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost\nnecessities in our being, these still drive us on.“The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he\nordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him\nnear the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three\nmates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s\ncompany formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant\nsearchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,\nas the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their\nleader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,\nalas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.“Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\nnearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\ndraughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes\nround excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\nserpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this\nway it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so\nbrimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!"

It seemed as though, by some\nnameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\nsame fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own\nmagnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,\nand mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest\neye of Starbuck fell downright.“In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well.

Cant them; cant them over! know ye\nnot the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,\nadvance.

  "content": "For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\nsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of\nhis existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen\nhim; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\nbattle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of\nwhale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\nwatery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\nalong solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth\nor more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any\nsort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity\nof the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,\ndirect and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole\nworld-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings\nconcerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels\nreported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or\nsuch a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,\nwhich whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\ncompletely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair\npresumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other\nthan Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked\nby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and\nmalice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by\naccident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,\nfor the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,\nmore, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,\nthan to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous\nencounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\nregarded.And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\ncaught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one\nof them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any\nother whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue\nin these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken\nlimbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of\nfatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\npiling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake\nthe fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White\nWhale had eventually come.Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\nhorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\nfabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\nterrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in\nmaritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\nabound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.\nAnd as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\nfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\nare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\nsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they\nare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is\nappallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\ngreatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such\nremotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a\nthousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or\naught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\nlongitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is\nwrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\na mighty birth."

  "content": "No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\nthe widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in\nthe end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\nhalf-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which\neventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything\nthat visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally\nstrike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White\nWhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\njaw.But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\nNot even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm\nWhale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are\nthose this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\nenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\nperhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\nare plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\nthe Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\nrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\nseated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\nfireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\nwhaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale\nanywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\nwhich stem him."

  "content": "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\ntimes thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\nnaturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to\nbe a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be\nso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\nNor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost\nsimilar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\nhimself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks\nincluded) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the\nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with\nsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general\nexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in\ntheir full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the\nsuperstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\nof the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days\nof the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\npractised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\nwarfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\nhopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\nas the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be\ninevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are\nsome remarkable documents that may be consulted.Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\nwere ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,\nchancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\nspecific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\naccompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\noffered.One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\nwith the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was\nthe unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had\nactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\ninstant of time.Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\naltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as\nthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,\neven to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm\nWhale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to\nhis pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious\nand contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning\nthe mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he\ntransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant\npoints."

  "content": "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\nas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\nthat some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\nbodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\nseas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\nbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\nnot have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\nbelieved by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a\nproblem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\nreal living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old\ntimes of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\nsurface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\nnear Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\nLand by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\nfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\nshould go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not\nonly ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in\ntime); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he\nwould still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to\nspout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied\njet would once more be seen.But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\nthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\nthe imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his\nuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\nbut, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\nforehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\nfeatures; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\nrevealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\nsame shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\nappellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\nhis vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\nsea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\ngleamings."

  "content": "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\ndeformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\nterror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\nspecific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.\nMore than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than\nperhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,\nwith every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known\nto turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their\nboats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in\nthe fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s\ninfernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\nthat he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\nunintelligent agent.Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\nhis more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\nboats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\nwhite curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\nsunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal."
