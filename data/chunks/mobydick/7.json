  "content": "Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\nrounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over\ndented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did\nyou fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,\nyou would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one\nunsleeping, ever-pacing thought.But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his\nnervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his\nthought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the\nmain-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought\nturn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely\npossessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of\nevery outer movement.“D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks\nthe shell. ’Twill soon be out.”The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the\ndeck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\nbulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\nwith one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody\naft.“Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\nship-board except in some extraordinary case.“Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not\nwholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike\nthe weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly\nglancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,\nstarted from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him\nresumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched\nhat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among\nthe men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have\nsummoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.\nBut this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed\nvoices."

  "content": "“Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\nhearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\nthrown them.“And what do ye next, men?”“Lower away, and after him!”“And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”“A dead whale or a stove boat!”More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\ncountenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to\ngaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they\nthemselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\nalmost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\nwhale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a\nbroad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye\nsee it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\nto heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly\nhumming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\nvitality in him.Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\nwith the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the\nother, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises\nme a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;\nwhosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes\npunctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me\nthat same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”“Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\ntopmaul: “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”"

Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have\nseen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”“Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far\nbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\nstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain\nAhab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off\nthy leg?”"

Aye, aye,” he shouted\nwith a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;\n“Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor\npegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with\nmeasureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him\nround Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,\nand round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye\nhave shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,\nand over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin\nout. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do\nlook brave.”“Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\nexcited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for\nMoby Dick!”“God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye,\nmen. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long\nface about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not\ngame for Moby Dick?”“I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\nAhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I\ncame here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many\nbarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\nAhab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”“Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\nlittle lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,\nlet me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_”“He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it\nrings most vast, but hollow.”“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee\nfrom blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,\nCaptain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”"

But in each event—in the living act, the\nundoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth\nthe mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\nwill strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach\noutside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is\nthat wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond.\nBut ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous\nstrength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable\nthing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the\nwhite whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me\nof blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the\nsun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of\nfair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\nmaster, man, is even that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no\nconfines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is\na doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted\nthee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that\nthing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small\nindignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder\nTurkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by\nthe sun. The Pagan leopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things,\nthat live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!\nThe crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this\nmatter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he\nsnorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one\ntost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to\nhelp strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From\nthis one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely\nhe will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a\nwhetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!\nSpeak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.\n(_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in\nhis lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without\nrebellion.”"

  "content": "“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\ndid not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the\nhold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor\nyet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment\ntheir hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up\nwith the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the\nwinds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as\nbefore. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?\nBut rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so\nmuch predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things\nwithin. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost\nnecessities in our being, these still drive us on.“The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he\nordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him\nnear the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three\nmates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s\ncompany formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant\nsearchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,\nas the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their\nleader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,\nalas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.“Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\nnearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\ndraughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes\nround excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\nserpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this\nway it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so\nbrimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!"

Let me\ntouch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three\nlevel, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,\nsuddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from\nStarbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some\nnameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\nsame fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own\nmagnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,\nand mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest\neye of Starbuck fell downright.“In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but\nonce take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, _that_\nhad perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped\nye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do\nappoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three\nmost honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain\nthe task?

Cut your\nseizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!”Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the\ndetached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs\nup, before him.“Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye\nnot the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,\nadvance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith,\nslowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon\nsockets with the fiery waters from the pewter."

Once more, and finally, the replenished\npewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free\nhand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.CHAPTER 37.

But not all of them knew of\nhis existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen\nhim; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\nbattle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of\nwhale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\nwatery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\nalong solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth\nor more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any\nsort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity\nof the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,\ndirect and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole\nworld-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings\nconcerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels\nreported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or\nsuch a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,\nwhich whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\ncompletely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair\npresumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other\nthan Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked\nby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and\nmalice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by\naccident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,\nfor the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,\nmore, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,\nthan to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous\nencounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\nregarded.And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\ncaught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one\nof them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any\nother whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue\nin these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken\nlimbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of\nfatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\npiling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake\nthe fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White\nWhale had eventually come.Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\nhorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\nfabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\nterrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in\nmaritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\nabound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.\nAnd as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\nfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\nare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\nsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they\nare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is\nappallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\ngreatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such\nremotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a\nthousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or\naught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\nlongitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is\nwrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\na mighty birth."

So that in many cases such a panic did he finally\nstrike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White\nWhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\njaw.But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\nNot even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm\nWhale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are\nthose this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\nenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\nperhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\nare plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\nthe Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\nrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\nseated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\nfireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\nwhaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale\nanywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\nwhich stem him."

  "content": "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\ntimes thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\nnaturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to\nbe a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be\nso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\nNor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost\nsimilar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\nhimself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks\nincluded) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the\nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with\nsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general\nexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in\ntheir full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the\nsuperstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\nof the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days\nof the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\npractised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\nwarfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\nhopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\nas the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be\ninevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are\nsome remarkable documents that may be consulted.Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\nwere ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,\nchancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\nspecific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\naccompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\noffered.One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\nwith the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was\nthe unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had\nactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\ninstant of time.Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\naltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as\nthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,\neven to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm\nWhale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to\nhis pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious\nand contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning\nthe mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he\ntransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant\npoints."

Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\nbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\nnot have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\nbelieved by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a\nproblem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\nreal living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old\ntimes of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\nsurface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\nnear Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\nLand by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\nfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\nshould go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not\nonly ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in\ntime); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he\nwould still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to\nspout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied\njet would once more be seen.But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\nthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\nthe imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his\nuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\nbut, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\nforehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\nfeatures; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\nrevealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\nsame shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\nappellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\nhis vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\nsea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\ngleamings."

For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,\nwith every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known\nto turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their\nboats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in\nthe fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s\ninfernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\nthat he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\nunintelligent agent.Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\nhis more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\nboats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\nwhite curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\nsunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal."

That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping\nhis sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away\nAhab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,\nno hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming\nmalice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that\nalmost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness\nagainst the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness\nhe at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but\nall his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam\nbefore him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious\nagencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left\nliving on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity\nwhich has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern\nChristians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of\nthe east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and\nworship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the\nabhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All\nthat most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;\nall truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\nbrain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy\nAhab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby\nDick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general\nrage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if\nhis chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it."

Then, in darting at the\nmonster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\ncorporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\nYet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\nmonths of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\none hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\nCape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\nanother; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on\nthe homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals\nduring the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a\nleg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was\nmoreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to\nlace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a\nstrait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when\nrunning into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails\nspread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,\nthe old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\nand issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\ndireful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,\nraved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\nWhen you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\nstill subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\ncontracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his\nnarrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been\nleft behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural\nintellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\ninstrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\nstormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\nconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\nhis strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\nreasonable object."
