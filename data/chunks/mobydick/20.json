  "content": "But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\nrecondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient\nlook-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even\nthrough Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and\nlockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along\nall continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long\nendure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not\nat last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the\nlast man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final\npuff.Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,\nwhich, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the\nprairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and\nscowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous\nriver-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar\nan inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem\nfurnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy\nextinction.But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a\nperiod ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois\nexceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day\nnot one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the\ncause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far\ndifferent nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious\nan end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales\nfor forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank\nGod, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the\ndays of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West,\nwhen the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness\nand a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of\nmonths, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain\nnot forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need\nwere, could be statistically stated."

  "content": "Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the\ngradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former\nyears (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in\nsmall pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in\nconsequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more\nremunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,\ninfluenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense\ncaravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,\nand pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but\nwidely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally\nfallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone\nwhales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with\nthem, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being\ndriven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened\nwith their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been\nvery recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two\nfirm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain\nimpregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty\nSwiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas\nand glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort\nto their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers\nand walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed\ncircle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one\ncachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this\npositive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.\nBut though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than\n13,000, have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the\nAmericans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this\ncircumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this\nmatter.Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness\nof the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to\nHarto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the\nKing of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are\nnumerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems\nno reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted\nfor thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all\nthe successive monarchs of the East—if they still survive there in\ngreat numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since\nhe has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as\nall Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the\nIsles of the sea combined."

  "content": "Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of\nwhales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,\ntherefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations\nmust be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of,\nby imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of\ncreation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and\nchildren who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this\ncountless host to the present human population of the globe.Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his\nspecies, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas\nbefore the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the\nTuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah’s flood he\ndespised Noah’s Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like\nthe Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will\nstill survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial\nflood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.CHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\nEnderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to\nhis own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his\nboat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when\nafter gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so\nvehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it\nwas, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);\nthen, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\nwrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances\nlusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\npervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the\ncondition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not\nbeen very long prior to the Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he\nhad been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;\nby some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his\nivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise\nsmitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme\ndifficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured."

  "content": "Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all\nthe anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of\na former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most\npoisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as\nthe sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,\nall miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than\nequally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief\ngo further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of\nthis: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that\nwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them\nfor the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the\njoy-childlessness of all hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal\nmiseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally\nprogressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of\nthis, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the\nthing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities\never have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at\nbottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an\narchangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the\nobvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal\nmiseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the\ngods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft\ncymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that\nthe gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad\nbirth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the\nsigners.Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more\nproperly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other\nparticulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,\nwhy it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the\nsailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such\nGrand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought\nspeechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.\nCaptain Peleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means\nadequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab’s deeper part, every\nrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory\nlight. But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.\nThat direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And\nnot only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,\nwho, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach\nto him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—remaining, as it\ndid, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself with terrors, not\nentirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that,\nthrough their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them\nlay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it\nwas, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it\ntranspire upon the Pequod’s decks.But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,\nor the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not\nwith earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took\nplain practical procedures;—he called the carpenter."

Moreover, the ship’s forge was\nordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and,\nto accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at\nonce to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.CHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high\nabstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But\nfrom the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they\nseem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.\nBut most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of\nthe high, humane abstraction; the Pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate;\nhence, he now comes in person on this stage.Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging\nto whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,\nalike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his\nown; the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk\nof all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with\nwood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of\nthe generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly\nefficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually\nrecurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in\nuncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in\nordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the\nshape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new\ntree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more\ndirectly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover\nunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both\nuseful and capricious.The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\nwas his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\nvices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\nexcept when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\nathwartships against the rear of the Try-works."

A lost land-bird of strange plumage\nstrays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\nright-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter\nmakes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the\ncarpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars\nto be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his\nbig vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\nconstellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\ncarpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out\npincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;\nbut the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded\noperation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter\nsigns him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth."

  "content": "Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent\nand without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he\ndeemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But\nwhile now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with\nsuch liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue\nsome uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For\nnothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal\nstolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the\nsurrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general\nstolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\npauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,\nand ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was\nthis half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\nall-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an\nold, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked\nnow and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have\nserved to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded\nforecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a\nlife-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had\ngathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small\noutward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\nstript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\nbabe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.\nYou might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him\ninvolved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did\nnot seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he\nhad been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\nuneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\nprocess. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,\nmust have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was\nlike one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in\nparvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little\nswelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of\nvarious sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,\npens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted\nto use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open\nthat part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him\nup by the legs, and there they were."

If he did not have a\ncommon soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously\ndid its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few\ndrops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it\nhad abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same\nunaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept\nhim a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an\nunreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his\nbody was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking\nall the time to keep himself awake.CHAPTER 108.

Hereby the casks are sought\nto be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the\nwithdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the\nprecious cargo.Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and\nthe Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from\nthe China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a\ngeneral chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and\nanother separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the\nJapanese islands—Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new\nivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long\npruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with\nhis back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his\nold courses again.“Who’s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round\nto it. “On deck! Begone!”“Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir.\nWe must up Burtons and break out.”“Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here\nfor a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”“Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make\ngood in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth\nsaving, sir.”“So it is, so it is; if we get it.”“I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.”"

Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky\ncasks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that’s a far\nworse plight than the Pequod’s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my leak;\nfor who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it,\neven if found, in this life’s howling gale? Starbuck! I’ll not have the\nBurtons hoisted.”“What will the owners say, sir?”“Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What\ncares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck,\nabout those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But\nlook ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,\nmy conscience is in this ship’s keel.—On deck!”“Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,\nwith a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost\nseemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward\nmanifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half\ndistrustful of itself; “A better man than I might well pass over in\nthee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in\na happier, Captain Ahab.”“Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On\ndeck!”“Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be forbearing!\nShall we not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?”Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most\nSouth-Sea-men’s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,\nexclaimed: “There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one\nCaptain that is lord over the Pequod.—On deck!”For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,\nyou would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of\nthe levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and\nas he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: “Thou hast\noutraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware\nof Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;\nbeware of thyself, old man.”"

It may have been a flash of honesty in him;\nor mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously\nforbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,\nin the important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders\nwere executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold\nwere perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it\nbeing calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the\nslumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight\nsending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they\ngo; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost\npuncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone\ncask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted\nplacards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.\nTierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of\nstaves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the\npiled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under\nfoot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and\nrolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the\nship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was\nit that the Typhoons did not visit them then.Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast\nbosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh\nto his endless end."

So with poor Queequeg, who, as\nharpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but—as\nwe have elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and\nfinally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all\nday in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the\nclumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen,\nthe harpooneers are the holders, so called.Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should\nhave stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,\nstripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about\namid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom\nof a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor\npagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he\ncaught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after\nsome days’ suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill\nof the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few\nlong-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his\nframe and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his\ncheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller\nand fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but\ndeeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony\nto that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And\nlike circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his\neyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe\nthat cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of\nthis waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any\nbeheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly\nwondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And\nthe drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all\nwith a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could\nadequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee or Greek\nhad higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you\nsaw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his\nswaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his\nfinal rest, and the ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and\nhigher towards his destined heaven."

  "content": "Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,\nwhat he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he\nasked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was\njust breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had\nchanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich\nwar-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all\nwhalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,\nand that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was\nnot unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead\nwarrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated\naway to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the\nstars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own\nmild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form\nthe white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the\nthought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual\nsea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.\nNo: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial\nto him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes\nwere without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and\nmuch lee-way adown the dim ages.Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter\nwas at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might\ninclude. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,\nwhich, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal\ngroves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin\nwas recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the\norder, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent\npromptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took\nQueequeg’s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s\nperson as he shifted the rule.“Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island\nsailor.Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general\nreference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the\ncoffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two\nnotches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his\ntools, and to work.When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he\nlightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring\nwhether they were ready for it yet in that direction.Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people\non deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s\nconsternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to\nhim, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some\ndying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will\nshortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be\nindulged."

He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock\ndrawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along\nwith one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,\nbiscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh\nwater was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up\nin the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for\na pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that\nhe might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without\nmoving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his\nlittle god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo\nbetween, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed\nover him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay\nQueequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in\nview. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and\nsigned to be replaced in his hammock.But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all\nthis while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took\nhim by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.“Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where\ngo ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where\nthe beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little\nerrand for me? Seek out one Pip, who’s now been missing long: I think\nhe’s in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he\nmust be very sad; for look! he’s left his tambourine behind;—I found\nit. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll beat ye your\ndying march.”“I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in\nviolent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and\nthat when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their\nwholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken\nin their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor\nPip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers\nof all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he\nspeaks again: but more wildly now.”“Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his\nharpoon? Lay it across here.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game\ncock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye\nthat; Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies\ngame! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;\ndied all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the\nAntilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he\njumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine over base Pip,\nand hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame\nupon all cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that\njumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!”"

Pip\nwas led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\nthat his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon\nthere seemed no need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some\nexpressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the\ncause of his sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he\nhad just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;\nand therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,\nhe averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter\nof his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a\nword, it was Queequeg’s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to\nlive, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale,\nor some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;\nthat while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,\ngenerally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.\nSo, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after\nsitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a\nvigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms\nand legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then\nspringing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,\npronounced himself fit for a fight."

And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet\nand seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written\nout on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a\nmystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in\nhis own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one\nvolume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own\nlive heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore\ndestined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon\nthey were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought\nit must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his,\nwhen one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg—“Oh,\ndevilish tantalization of the gods!”CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great\nSouth Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear\nPacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my\nyouth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a\nthousand leagues of blue.There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently\nawful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those\nfabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.\nJohn. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery\nprairies and Potters’ Fields of all four continents, the waves should\nrise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of\nmixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all\nthat we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing\nlike slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by\ntheir restlessness.To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must\never after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of\nthe world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same\nwaves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday\nplanted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still\ngorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between\nfloat milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown\nArchipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine\nPacific zones the world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to\nit; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal\nswells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan."
