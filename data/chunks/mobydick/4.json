  "content": "I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\nthey fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;\nyes, it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll\nget up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,\nand his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very\npunctual then.I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\nstories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,\nas they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or\nbrig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);\nafter listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I\nwent up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg\nmust certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there\nhe was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\nto grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\nbe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\nholding a piece of wood on his head.“For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\nhave some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But\nnot a word did he reply.Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\nand no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\nturning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\nit promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\nordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\nget into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\nthought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy\nposition, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\nawake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\nday; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\nhad been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\nsun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but\nwith a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\nforehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over."

  "content": "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,\nbe it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\nother person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when\na man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\nto him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\nlodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\nargue the point with him.And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed\nnow, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise\nand progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\nreligions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\nQueequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings\nin cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;\nuseless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene\nand common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such\nan extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly\npained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\nRamadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;\nhence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must\nnecessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\none word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\nborn on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated\nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\nin. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\nfeast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the\nafternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening."

  "content": "“No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the\ninferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who\nhad visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,\nwhen a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in\nthe yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were\nplaced in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\nwith breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\nwere sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just\nas though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\nimpression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\nfrom his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\nthan one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\nfinally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\nreligion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\nconcern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such\na sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\npiety.At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\nmake much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\nPequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.CHAPTER 18. His Mark.As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\ncarrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us\nfrom his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,\nand furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that\ncraft, unless they previously produced their papers.“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the\nbulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from\nbehind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted.\nSon of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present\nin communion with any Christian church?”“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here\nbe it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at\nlast come to be converted into the churches."

I never saw him going there, and I pass\nit every Lord’s day.”“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said\nI; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First\nCongregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”“Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain\nthyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same\nancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,\nand Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us\nbelong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole\nworshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some\nqueer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all\njoin hands.”“Splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer.\n“Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast\nhand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father\nMapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come\naboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog\nthere—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great\nanchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and\nhe handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did\nyou ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a\nfish?”"

  "content": "Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon\nthe bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats\nhanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his\nharpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,\nspose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he\ndarted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the\nship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e\neye; why, dad whale dead.”“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\ngangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must\nhave Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,\nQuohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon\nenrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\nsigning, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know\nhow to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name\nor make thy mark?”But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken\npart in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the\noffered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact\ncounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so\nthat through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his\nappellative, it stood something like this:—Quohog. his X mark."

  "content": "Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,\nand at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his\nbroad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one\nentitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in\nQueequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,\nlooked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do\nmy duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for\nthe souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,\nwhich I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial\nbondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the\nwrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer\nclear of the fiery pit!”Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,\nheterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,”\ncried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the\nshark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty\nsharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out\nof all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never\ncame to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he\nshrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case\nhe got stove and went to Davy Jones.”“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself,\nas I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what\nit is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this\nungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this\nsame Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on\nJapan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st\nthou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and\nthrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye.\nThink of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death\nand the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an\neverlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over\nus, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to\nthink about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking\nof; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the\nnearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”"

There he stood, very quietly overlooking some\nsailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he\nstooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which\notherwise might have been wasted.CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.“Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from\nthe water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the\nabove words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,\nlevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but\nshabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a\nblack handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all\ndirections flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated\nribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.“Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.“You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little\nmore time for an uninterrupted look at him.“Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm,\nand then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed\nbayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.“Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”“Anything down there about your souls?”“About what?”“Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter though,\nI know many chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are\nall the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a\nwagon.”“What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.“_He’s_ got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that\nsort in other chaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous\nemphasis upon the word _he_.“Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from\nsomewhere; he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t know.”“Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old Thunder\nyet, have ye?”“Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness\nof his manner.“Captain Ahab.”“What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”“Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye\nhav’n’t seen him yet, have ye?”"

He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be\nall right again before long.”“All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a solemnly\nderisive sort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then\nthis left arm of mine will be all right; not before.”“What do you know about him?”“What did they _tell_ you about him? Say that!”“They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s\na good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”“That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump when\nhe gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s the word with\nCaptain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off\nCape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;\nnothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar\nin Santa?—heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver\ncalabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last\nvoyage, according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them\nmatters and something more, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye?\nWho knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve\nheard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of\nthat, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows a’most—I mean they\nknow he’s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.”“My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I\ndon’t know, and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be\na little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab,\nof that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all\nabout the loss of his leg.”“_All_ about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”“Pretty sure.”"

Anyhow, it’s all\nfixed and arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other must go with him,\nI suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity ’em!

Morning to ye, shipmates,\nmorning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one\nof ’em.”“Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us.

But stop, tell me your name, will you?”“Elijah.”Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each\nother’s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was\nnothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone\nperhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and\nlooking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,\nthough at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I\nsaid nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my\ncomrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner\nthat we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,\nbut with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This\ncircumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,\nshrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments\nand half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain\nAhab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver\ncalabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship\nthe day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the\nvoyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy\nthings."

All Astir.A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.\nNot only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on\nboard, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything\nbetokened that the ship’s preparations were hurrying to a close.\nCaptain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam\nkeeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing\nand providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on\nthe rigging were working till long after night-fall.On the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was given at\nall the inns where the ship’s company were stopping, that their chests\nmust be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the\nvessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,\nresolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they\nalways give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail\nfor several days.

Just so with whaling,\nwhich necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far\nfrom all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And\nthough this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means\nto the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of\nthe whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution\nof the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote\nharbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,\nwhaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and\nespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which\nthe success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare\nspars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but\na spare Captain and duplicate ship.At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the\nPequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,\nfuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time\nthere was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and\nends of things, both large and small.Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain\nBildad’s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable\nspirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_\ncould help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after\nonce fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a\njar of pickles for the steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of\nquills for the chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third time\nwith a roll of flannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back.\nNever did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt\nCharity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this\ncharitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn\nher hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,\nand consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother\nBildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of\nwell-saved dollars.But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\nboard, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and\na still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\nCaptain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him\na long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down\nwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a\nwhile Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men\ndown the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and\nthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwam."

To these questions they\nwould answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected\naboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could\nattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I\nhad been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly\nin my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so\nlong a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\nabsolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open\nsea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he\nbe already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up\nhis suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I\nsaid nothing, and tried to think nothing.At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\ncertainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early\nstart.CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we\ndrew nigh the wharf.“There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to\nQueequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come\non!”“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close\nbehind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating\nhimself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain\ntwilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.“Going aboard?”“Hands off, will you,” said I.“Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”“Ain’t going aboard, then?”“Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you\nknow, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”“No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and\nwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable\nglances.“Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We\nare going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be\ndetained.”“Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”“He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”“Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few\npaces.“Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\nshoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that\nship a while ago?”Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,\nI thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”“Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\ntouching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will\nye?“Find who?”"

I\nwas going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all one,\nall in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it? Good-bye to\nye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before the\nGrand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving\nme, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound\nquiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\nhatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\nto the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\nlight, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\ntattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\nface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\nslept upon him.“Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,\nlooking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\nwharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\nwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\nmatter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I\nbeat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\nQueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\nestablish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear,\nas though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,\nsat quietly down there.“Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.“Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him\nface.”“Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;\nbut how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you\nare heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,\nhe’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”"

  "content": "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\nlighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\nover the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\nhim in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\nland, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\nchiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening\nsome of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house\ncomfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy\nfellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was\nvery convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs\nwhich are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself\nunder a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\nfrom me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.“What’s that for, Queequeg?”“Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\nwhich, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\nhis soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\nstrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to\ntell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\ntroubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\nrubbed his eyes.“Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”“Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\ncame aboard last night.”“What Captain?—Ahab?”“Who but him indeed?”I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we\nheard a noise on deck.“Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,\nthat; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so\nsaying he went on deck, and we followed.It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and\nthrees; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\nengaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various\nlast things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly\nenshrined within his cabin.CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s\nriggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and\nafter the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with\nher last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her\nbrother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the\ntwo Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to\nthe chief mate, Peleg said:"

  "content": "“Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is\nall ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\nWell, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”“No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said\nBildad, “but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\nPeleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the\nquarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as\nwell as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign\nof him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But\nthen, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\ngetting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,\nas that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he\nwas not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab\nstayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\nmerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\nconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\ncabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,\nbefore they quit the ship for good with the pilot.But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\nPeleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and\ncommanding, and not Bildad.“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at\nthe main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this\nwhalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\nPequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known\nto be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and\nthe crew sprang for the handspikes."

And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be\nit known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed\npilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot\nin order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was\nconcerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might\nnow be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the\napproaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave\nof psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some\nsort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good\nwill. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that\nno profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\ngetting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\ncopy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he\nwould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I\npaused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of\nthe perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\na pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in\npious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred\nand seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,\nand turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\nthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my\nfirst kick.“Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.\n“Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye\nspring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\nwhiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\nsay, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved\nalong the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\nimperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,\nCaptain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\nwas a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into\nnight, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\nfreezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white\nivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from\nthe bows.Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as\nthe old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering\nfrost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his\nsteady notes were heard,—"

Spite of this frigid winter night in\nthe boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there\nwas yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and\nmeads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the\nspring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no\nlonger. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\nalongside.It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected\nat this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;\nvery loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a\nvoyage—beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his\nhard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate\nsailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to\nencounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to\na thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,—poor old Bildad\nlingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the\ncabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and\nlooked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only\nbounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the\nland; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and\nnowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,\nconvulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,\nfor a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,\n“Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\nhis philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern\ncame too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now\na word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate."

Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to\nye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye and good luck to ye\nall—and this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in\nold Nantucket.

Be\ncareful in the hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye\nharpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.\nwithin the year. Don’t forget your prayers, either.

I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon\nthe man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous\nvoyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another\ntempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest\nthings are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;\nthis six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only\nsay that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that\nmiserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give\nsuccor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,\nhearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our\nmortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s\ndirest jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,\nthough it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and\nthrough. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,\nfights ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks\nall the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly\nrushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid\neffort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the\nwildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the\ntreacherous, slavish shore?But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,\nindefinite as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,\nthan be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For\nworm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the\nterrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O\nBulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy\nocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!CHAPTER 24.

If a\nstranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,\nit would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were\nhe presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation\nof the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F.

Butchers we are, that is\ntrue. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been\nall Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And\nas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye\nshall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally\nunknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm\nwhale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But\neven granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered\nslippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable\ncarrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to\ndrink in all ladies’ plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much\nenhances the popular conceit of the soldier’s profession; let me assure\nye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would\nquickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale’s vast tail,\nfanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the\ncomprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and\nwonders of God!But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it\nunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding\nadoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn\nround the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of\nscales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.Why did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling\nfleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit\nout whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some\nscore or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did\nBritain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties\nupwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of\nAmerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;\nsail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen\nthousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,\nat the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our\nharbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if\nthere be not something puissant in whaling?But this is not the half; look again."
