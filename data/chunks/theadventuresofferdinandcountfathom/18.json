  "content": "“Meanwhile our worthy landlord was suddenly cut off by death; and his\nwidow being resolved to retire into her own country, we secretly\nembarked in the same ship, and arrived in England about eighteen months\nago. Antonia still continued to pine over the ruin of her house; as she\ncould hear no tidings of Don Diego, she concluded he was dead, and\nmourned with unabating sorrow. In vain I assured her, that, soon as my\nown affairs should be adjusted, I would exert my whole endeavours to\nfind and succour him. She could not imagine that a man of his spirit\nand disposition would live so long in obscurity. And her affliction\nderived new force from the death of the consul’s widow, with whom she\nhad lived in the most unbounded intimacy and friendship. From that day,\nher health evidently declined. She foresaw her dissolution, and\ncomforted herself with the hope of seeing her husband and her friend in\na place where no treachery is felt, and no sorrow is known; confident\nof my integrity, and the purity of my love, she, in the most pathetic\nterms, recommended Serafina to my care.“Ha! weepest thou, fair excellence, at the remembrance of that tender\nscene, when the good Antonia, on the bed of death, joined thy soft hand\nto mine, and said, ‘Renaldo, I bequeath this orphan to your love; it is\na sacred pledge, which, if you cherish with due honour and regard,\ninternal peace and happiness will ever smile within your bosom; but if\nyou treat it with indifference, dishonour, or neglect, just Heaven will\npunish your breach of trust with everlasting disappointments and\ndisquiet.’“Signior Don Diego, I see you are moved, and therefore will not dwell\non such distressful circumstances. The excellent Antonia exchanged this\nlife for a more happy state; and so exquisite was the sorrow of the\ntender-hearted Serafina, as to torture me with the apprehension that\nshe would not long survive her pious mother. How I obeyed the\ninjunctions of that departing saint, Monimia (for that name she now\nassumed) can testify, until that artful serpent Fathom glided into our\nmutual confidence, abused our ears, poisoned our unsuspected faith, and\neffected that fatal breach, productive of all the misery and vexation\nwhich we have suffered, and which is now so happily expelled.”“Heaven,” said the Castilian, “hath visited me for the sins and errors\nof my youth; yet, such mercy hath been mingled with its chastisements,\nI dare not murmur or repine. The tears of penitence and sorrow shall\nwater my Antonia’s grave; as for Mendoza, I rejoice at his treachery,\nby which the obligation of my promise is cancelled, and my honour fully\nacquitted. He shall not triumph in his guilt. My services, my\ncharacter, and innocence shall soon confront his perfidy, and, I hope,\ndefeat his interest. The King is just and gracious, nor is my family\nand name unknown.”"

  "content": "Here the Jew interposing, presented to him a letter from a person of\nconsequence at Madrid, whom Joshua had interested in the cause of Don\nDiego; that nobleman had already found means to represent the case of\nZelos to his Majesty, who had actually ordered Don Manuel to be\nconfined, until the injured person should appear to justify himself,\nand prosecute his accuser according to the terms of law. At the same\ntime Don Diego was summoned to present himself before the King within a\nlimited time, to answer to the charge which Mendoza had brought against\nhim.The Spaniard’s heart overflowed with gratitude and joy, when he read\nthis intimation; he embraced the Jew, who, before Zelos could give\nutterance to his thoughts, told him that the Spanish Ambassador at\nLondon, having been prepossessed in his favour, craved the honour of\nseeing Don Diego; and that he, Joshua, was ready to conduct him to the\nhouse.“Then is my heart at rest!” cried the Castilian; “the house of Zelos\nonce more shall lift up its head. I shall again revisit my native\ncountry with honour, and abase the villain who hath soiled my fame! O\nmy children! this day is replete with such joy and satisfaction, as I\ndid not think had been in the power of Heaven to grant, without the\ninterposition of a miracle! To you, Renaldo, to you illustrious lady,\nand to these worthy gentlemen, am I indebted for the restoration of\nthat for which alone I wish to live; and when my heart ceases to retain\nthe obligation, may I forfeit the name of a Castilian, and scorn and\ndishonour be my portion.”Perhaps all Europe could not produce another company so happy as that\nwhich now sat down to dinner in the house of Madam Clement, whose own\nbenevolent heart was peculiarly adapted for such enjoyment. The lovers\nfeasted their eyes more than their appetite, by a tender intercourse of\nglances, which needed not the slow interpretation of speech; while the\nSpaniard regarded them alternately with looks of wonder and paternal\njoy, and every individual surveyed the all-deserving pair with\nadmiration and esteem."

  "content": "Serafina taking the advantage of this general satisfaction, when the\nheart, softened into complacency, deposits every violent thought: “I\nmust now,” said she, “try my interest with Renaldo. The good company\nshall bear witness to my triumph or repulse. I do not ask you to\nforgive, but to withhold your vengeance from the wretched Fathom. His\nfraud, ingratitude, and villany are, I believe, unrivalled; yet his\nbase designs have been defeated; and Heaven perhaps hath made him the\ninvoluntary instrument for bringing our constancy and virtue to the\ntest; besides, his perfidy is already punished with the last degree of\nhuman misery and disgrace. The doctor, who has traced him in all his\nconduct and vicissitudes of fortune, will draw a picture of his present\nwretchedness, which, I doubt not, will move your compassion, as it hath\nalready excited mine.”The generous hostess was ready to enforce this charitable proposal with\nall her eloquence, when Melvil, with a look that well expressed his\nmagnanimity of love, replied, “Such a boon becomes the gentle Serafina!\nO! every moment furnishes me with fresh matter to admire the virtues of\nthy soul. If thou, whose tender heart hath been so rent with misery and\nanguish, canst intercede for thy tormentor, who now suffers in his\nturn, shall I refuse to pardon the miserable wretch! No, let me glory\nin imitating the great example, and solicit Don Diego in behalf of the\nsame miscreant whose perfidious barbarity cost him such intolerable\nwoe.” “Enough,” cried the Castilian, “I have disclaimed the vindictive\nprinciples of a Spaniard; and leave the miserable object to the sting\nof his own conscience, which, soon or late, will not fail to avenge the\nwrongs we have sustained from his deceit.”CHAPTER SIXTY-SIXTHE HISTORY DRAWS NEAR A PERIOD.Universal was the applause which they acquired by this noble sacrifice\nof their resentment. The afternoon was spent in the utmost harmony and\ngood-humour; and at the earnest solicitation of Renaldo, whose fancy\nstill harboured the apprehensions of another separation, Don Diego\nconsented that the indissoluble knot should be tied between that young\ngentleman and Serafina in two days, and the place appointed for the\nceremony was the very church where they had been restored to the arms\nof each other."

Fraught with this\ninstruction, the Israelite desired a private audience of the Castilian,\nin which, after an apology for the freedom of his demand, “Signior Don\nDiego,” said he, “as your fortune hath been so long embezzled by your\nadversary in Spain, and your correspondence with that country entirely\ncut off, it is not to be supposed that your finances are at present in\nsuch a condition as to maintain the splendour of your family. Count de\nMelvil’s whole fortune is at your command; and had not he been afraid\nof giving umbrage to the peculiar delicacy of your sentiments, he would\nhave pressed you to use it for your convenience. For my own part, over\nand above the inclination I have to serve Don Diego, I consult my own\nprivate advantage in desiring you to accept my service on this\noccasion. Money is the chief commodity in which I deal, and, if you\nhonour me with your commands, I shall be a gainer by my obedience.”Don Diego replied, with a smile that denoted how well he understood the\nmeaning of this address, “Surely, Signior, I am bound by the strongest\nties to exert my utmost endeavours for your advantage; and I pray God\nthis your proposal may have that issue. I am well acquainted with the\nCount’s generosity and refined notions of honour; and too much obliged\nby him already, to hesitate with punctilious reserve in accepting his\nfuture assistance. Nevertheless, since you have contrived a scheme for\nremoving all scruples of that sort, I shall execute it with pleasure;\nand, in the form of business, you shall have all the security I can\ngive for what shall be necessary to answer my present occasions.”"

Although the Spaniard had been accustomed to the\nuncommon generosity of Melvil, he could not help wondering at this\nnobleness of behaviour, so little to be expected from any merchant,\nmuch less from a Jewish broker.While this affair was on the anvil, Renaldo, who could no longer\nwithhold the communication of his happiness from his sister and\nrelations in Germany, took up the pen, and, in a letter to his\nbrother-in-law, recounted all the circumstances of the surprising turn\nof fate which he had experienced since his arrival in England. He\nlikewise related the story of Don Diego, informed them of the day\nappointed for his nuptials, and entreated the Major to make a journey\nto London with his wife; or, if that should be impracticable, to come\nas far as Brussels, where they should be met by him and his Serafina.\nThere was now but one day between him and the accomplishment of his\ndearest wish, and that was spent in procuring a licence, and adjusting\nthe preparations for the grand festival. Don Diego in the forenoon\nvisited Madam Clement, to whom he repeated his warm acknowledgments of\nher bounty and maternal affection to his daughter, and presented to\nSerafina bank notes to the amount of five hundred pounds, to defray the\nnecessary expense for her wedding ornaments."

  "content": "All the previous steps being taken for the solemnisation of this\ninteresting event, and the hour of appointment arrived, the bridegroom,\naccompanied by his father-in-law, hastened to the place of rendezvous,\nwhich was the vestry-room of the church we have already described;\nwhere they were received by the good clergyman in his canonicals; and\nhere they had not waited many minutes, when they were joined by Madam\nClement and the amiable bride, escorted by the friendly physician, who\nhad all along borne such a share in their concerns. Serafina was\ndressed in a sack of white satin, and the ornaments of her head were\nadjusted in the Spanish fashion, which gave a peculiar air to her\nappearance, and an additional spirit to those attractions which engaged\nthe heart of each beholder. There was nothing remarkable in the habit\nof Renaldo, who had copied the plainness and elegance of his mistress;\nbut, when she entered the place, his features were animated with a\ndouble proportion of vivacity, and their eyes meeting, seemed to kindle\na blaze which diffused warmth and joy through the countenances of all\npresent.After a short pause, her father led her to the altar, and gave her away\nto the transported Renaldo, before the priest who performed the\nceremony, and bestowed the nuptial benediction on this enraptured pair.\nThe sanction of the church being thus obtained, they withdrew into the\nvestry, where Melvil sealed his title on her rosy lips, and presented\nhis wife to the company, who embraced her in their turns, with fervent\nwishes for their mutual happiness.Though the scene of this transaction was remote from any inhabited\nneighbourhood, the church was surrounded by a crowd of people, who,\nwith uncommon demonstration of surprise and admiration, petitioned\nHeaven to bless so fair a couple. Such indeed was their eagerness to\nsee them, that some lives were endangered by the pressure of the crowd,\nwhich attended them with loud acclamations to the coach, after the\nbridegroom had deposited in the hands of the minister one hundred\npounds for the benefit of the poor of that parish, and thrown several\nhandfuls of money among the multitude. Serafina re-embarked in Madam\nClement’s convenience, with that good lady and Don Diego, while\nRenaldo, with the clergyman and doctor, followed in Joshua’s coach, to\na pleasant country-house upon the Thames, at a distance of a few miles\nfrom London. This the Jew had borrowed from the owner for a few days,\nand there they were received by that honest Hebrew, who had provided a\nvery elegant entertainment for the occasion. He had also bespoke a\nsmall but excellent band of music, which regaled their ears while they\nsat at dinner; and the afternoon being calm and serene, he prevailed on\nthem to take the air on the river, in a barge which he had prepared for\nthe purpose."

  "content": "But, notwithstanding this diversity of amusement, Renaldo would have\nfound it the longest day he had ever passed, had not his imagination\nbeen diverted by an incident which employed his attention during the\nremaining part of the evening. They had drunk tea, and engaged in a\nparty at whist, when they were surprised with a noise of contention\nfrom a public-house, that fronted the windows of the apartment in which\nthey sat. Alarmed at this uproar, they forsook their cards, and,\nthrowing up the casement, beheld a hearse surrounded by four men on\nhorseback, who had stopped the carriage, and violently pulled the\ndriver from his seat. This uncommon arrest had engaged the curiosity of\nthe publican’s family, who stood at the door to observe the\nconsequence, when all of a sudden appeared a person in canonicals, well\nmounted, who, riding up to those who maltreated the driver, bestowed\nupon one of them such a blow with the butt-end of his whip, as laid him\nsprawling on the ground; and, springing from his saddle upon the box,\ntook the reins into his own hand, swearing with great vehemence, that\nhe would murder every man who should attempt to obstruct the hearse.The good priest who had married Renaldo was not a little scandalised at\nthis ferocious behaviour in a clergyman, and could not help saying\naloud, he was a disgrace to the cloth when the horseman looking up to\nthe window, replied, “Sir, may I be d—n’d, if any man in England has a\ngreater respect for the cloth than I have; but at present I am quite\ndistracted.” So saying, he whipped up the horses, and had actually\ndisentangled the hearse from those who surrounded it, when he was\nopposed by another troop, one of whom alighted with great expedition,\nand cut the harness so as that he could not possibly proceed. Finding\nhimself thus driven to bay, he leaped upon the ground, and exercised\nhis weapon with such amazing strength and agility, that several of his\nantagonists were left motionless on the field, before he was\noverpowered and disarmed by dint of numbers, who assailed him on all\nsides.The mad parson being thus taken prisoner, an elderly person, of a very\nprepossessing appearance, went up to the hearse, and, unbolting the\ndoor, a young lady sprung out, and shrieking, ran directly to the\npublic-house, to the infinite astonishment and affright of the whole\nfamily, who believed it was the spirit of the deceased person, whose\nbody lay in the carriage. Renaldo, who was with difficulty restrained\nfrom interposing in behalf of the clergyman against such odds, no\nsooner perceived this apparition, than, supposing her to be some\ndistressed damsel, his Quixotism awoke, he descended in an instant, and\nrushed into the house, among those that pursued the fair phantom. Don\nDiego and the physician took the same road, while the real clergyman\nand Joshua tarried with the ladies, who were, by this time, very much\ninterested in the event."

  "content": "Melvil found the young lady in the hands of the old gentleman, who had\nreleased her from the hearse, and who now bitterly upbraided her for\nher folly and disobedience; while she protested with great vivacity,\nthat whatever she might suffer from his severity, she would never\nsubmit to the hateful match he had proposed, nor break the promise she\nhad already made to the gentleman who now attempted to rescue her from\nthe tyranny of a cruel father. This declaration was followed by a\nplentiful shower of tears, which the father could not behold with\nunmoistened eyes, although he reviled her with marks of uncommon\ndispleasure; and turning to the Count, “I appeal to you, sir,” said he,\n“whether I have not reason to curse the undutiful obstinacy of that\npert baggage, and renounce her for ever as an alien to my blood. She\nhas, for some months, been solicited in marriage by an honest citizen,\na thirty thousand pound man; and instead of listening to such an\nadvantageous proposal, she hath bestowed her heart upon a young fellow\nnot worth a groat. Ah! you degenerate hussy, this comes of your plays\nand romances. If thy mother were not a woman of an unexceptionable life\nand conversation, I should verily believe thou art no child of mine.\nRun away with a beggar! for shame!”“I suppose,” replied Renaldo, “the person to whom your daughter’s\naffection inclines, is that clergyman who exerted himself so manfully\nat the door?” “Clergyman!” cried the other, “adad! he has more of the\ndevil than the church about him. A ruffian! he has, for aught I know,\nmurdered the worthy gentleman whom I intended for my son-in-law; and\nthe rogue, if I had not kept out of his way, would, I suppose, have\nserved me with the same sauce. Me! who have been his master for many\nyears, and had resolved to make a man of him. Sir, he was my own clerk,\nand this is the return I have met with from the serpent which I\ncherished in my bosom.”Here he was interrupted by the arrival of the citizen for whom he had\nexpressed such concern; that gentleman had received a contusion upon\none eye, by which the sight was altogether obstructed, so that he\nconcluded he should never retrieve the use of that organ, and with\ngreat clamour took all the spectators to witness the injury he had\nsustained; he entered the room with manifest perturbation, demanded\nsatisfaction of the father, and peremptorily declared it should not be\na lost eye to him if there was law in England. This unseasonable\ndemand, and the boisterous manner in which it was made, did not at all\nsuit the present humour of the old gentleman, who told him peevishly he\nowed him no eye, and bade him go and ask reparation of the person who\nhad done him wrong."

The old gentleman thanked them for their courtesy, which he did\nnot think proper to refuse, and while he led, or rather hauled\nMademoiselle over the way, under the auspices of the Castilian, Renaldo\nset the lover at liberty, made him a tender of his good offices, and\nadvised him to wait at the public-house for an happy issue of their\nnegotiation.The pseudo-parson was very much affected by this generous proffer, for\nwhich he made suitable acknowledgments, and protested before God he\nwould die a thousand deaths rather than part with his dear Charlotte.\nHer father no sooner entered the apartment, than he was known by Joshua\nto be a considerable trader in the city of London, and the merchant was\nglad to find himself among his acquaintance. He was so full of the\nstory which had brought him thither, that he had scarce sat down when\nhe began to complain of his hard fate, in having an only child who was\nso mean, stubborn, and contumacious; and every sentence was concluded\nwith an apostrophe of reproaches to the delinquent.The Jew having allowed him to ring out his alarm, condoled his\nmisfortune, and gravely counselled the young lady to wean her\naffections from such an unworthy object, for he supposed her favourite\nwas a man of no principle, or liberal endowments, otherwise her father\nwould not exclaim so bitterly against her conduct. Charlotte, who\nwanted neither beauty nor understanding, assured him that her lover’s\ncharacter was, in all respects, unblemished, for the truth of which\nassertion she appealed to her papa, who owned, with reluctance, that\nthe young man was a gentleman by birth, that he had served him with\nremarkable diligence and integrity, and that his accomplishments were\nfar superior to his station in life. “But then,” said he, “the fellow\nhas not a shilling of his own, and would you have me give away my\ndaughter to a beggar?”"

Let us suppose you\ncan afford to give with your daughter ten thousand pounds, which would\nenable this young man to live with credit and reputation, and engage\nadvantageously in trade, for which you say he is well qualified, the\nalternative then will be, whether you would rather see her in the arms\nof a deserving youth whom she loves, enjoying all the comforts of life\nwith a moderate fortune, which it will always be in your own power to\nimprove, or tied for life to a monied man whom she detests, cursing her\nhard fate, and despising that superfluity of wealth, in spite of which\nshe finds herself so truly wretched.”The old gentleman seemed to be startled at this observation, which was\nreinforced by Renaldo’s saying, that he would, moreover, enjoy the\nunutterable pleasure of giving happiness to a worthy man, whose\ngratitude would co-operate with his love, in approving himself a\ndutiful son, as well as an affectionate husband. He then represented\nthe family disquiets and dismal tragedies produced from such mercenary\nand compulsive matches, and, in conclusion related the story of Don\nDiego and his daughter, which when the merchant heard, he started up\nwith marks of terror in his countenance, and, throwing up the casement,\ncalled upon Valentine with great vociferation. This was the name of his\ndaughter’s admirer, who no sooner heard the summons than he flew to the\nspot from whence it came, and the merchant, without any further\npreamble, seizing his hand, joined it with that of Charlotte, saying,\nwith great trepidation, “Here, take her, in the name of God, and thank\nthis honourable company for your good fortune.”The lovers were transported with exquisite joy at this sudden\ndetermination in their favour. Valentine, having kissed the hand of his\nmistress with all the eagerness of rapture, and acknowledged the\nmerchant’s generosity, paid his respects to the ladies with a very\npolite address, and with demonstrations of uncommon gratitude and\nsensibility, thanked the gentlemen, and the Count in particular, for\ntheir good offices, to which he attributed the happiness he now\nenjoyed. While Serafina and Madam Clement caressed the amiable\nCharlotte, the rest of the company congratulated her admirer upon his\nchoice and success, though the clergyman could not help reprehending\nhim for profaning the sacerdotal habit."

He then, at the request of Renaldo, unfolded the\nmystery of the hearse, by giving them to understand that Charlotte’s\nfather having got inkling of their mutual passion, had dismissed his\nclerk, and conveyed his daughter to a country-house in the\nneighbourhood of London, in order to cut off their correspondence;\nnotwithstanding these precautions they had found means to communicate\nwith each other by letters, which were managed by a third person; and\nhis rival being very importunate in his solicitations, they had\nconcerted the expedient of the hearse, which he provided and conducted\nthrough a road contiguous to the end of the merchant’s garden, where\nCharlotte, being apprised of the design, waited for its approach, and\nembarked in it without hesitation. Valentine thought himself\nsufficiently screened from discovery by his disguise, but he was\nunfortunately met by a servant of the family, who recollected his\nfeatures, and immediately gave the alarm, upon which the father and his\nfriends took horse, and pursued them by two different roads, until they\nwere overtaken at this place.He had scarce finished this short relation, when his rival, bluntly\nentering the apartment, with an handkerchief tied round his eye,\ncommitted Valentine to the charge of a constable, who attended him, by\na warrant from a justice of the peace in that neighbourhood, and\nthreatened to prosecute the merchant on an action of damages for the\nloss of an eye, which he said he had sustained in his service. The\ncompany endeavoured to appease this citizen, by representing that his\nmisfortune was no other than a common inflammation, nor was it owing to\nmalice aforethought, but entirely to the precipitate passion of an\nincensed young man, who, by the bye, acted in his own defence. At the\nsame time the merchant promised to make any reasonable satisfaction,\nupon which the other demanded an obligation, importing that he would,\nin ten days from the date, bestow upon him his daughter in marriage,\nwith a portion of fifteen thousand pounds, or, in case of failure, pay\nhim double the sum.The merchant, exasperated at this extravagant demand, told him flatly\nhe had already disposed of his daughter to Valentine, who, he believed,\nwas a much more deserving man, and that he was ready to wait upon the\nmagistrate who had granted the warrant, in order to give bail for his\nfuture son-in-law. This was a mortifying declaration to the plaintiff,\nthough he condoled himself with the hope of being a gainer by the loss\nof his eye, and now the pain was over would have been very sorry to\nfind his sight retrieved. The old gentleman, Joshua, and Renaldo\naccompanied the prisoner to the house of the justice, where he was\nimmediately admitted to bail.

Now his imagination\nbegan to anticipate with the enthusiastic rage of an inspired sibyl; he\nwas instantaneously transported from the conversation, and every nerve\nwas braced to such a degree of impatience, that human nature could not\nlong endure the tension.He, therefore, having withstood the impulse about a quarter of an hour,\nat length gave way to his impetuosity, and, springing from his friends,\nfound himself in a dark passage, at the farther end of which he\nperceived Madam Clement coming out of a chamber with a light, which, at\nsight of him, she set down, and vanished in a moment. This was the star\nthat pointed to his paradise; he hailed the signal, entered the\napartment, and, like a lion, rushing on his prey, approached the\nnuptial bed, where Serafina, surrounded by all the graces of beauty,\nsoftness, sentiment, and truth, lay trembling as a victim at the altar,\nand strove to hide her blushes from his view—the door was shut, the\nlight extinguished—he owned his lot was more than mortal man could\nclaim.Here let me draw the decent veil that ought to shade the secret\nmysteries of Hymen. Away, unhallowed scoffers, who profane, with idle\npleasantry or immodest hint, these holy rites; and leave those happy\nlovers to enjoy, in one another’s arms, unutterable bliss, the\nwell-earned palm of virtue and of constancy, which had undergone the\nmost severe refinement. A more deserving pair night’s curtain shrouds\nnot in its dark extent.The thoughts of Renaldo’s felicity threw a damp on the spirits of\nValentine, who saw the term of his probation protracted a few days\nlonger, and could not help wishing in his heart that he had achieved\nthe adventure which would have abridged his expectation, though at the\nexpense of the old gentleman’s displeasure. He filled a bumper to the\nhealth of the bride and bridegroom, and throwing up his eyes with marks\nof admiration, exclaimed, “How happy is the Count! alas! five days\nlonger must I rein my impatience!” “It is but reasonable, you rogue,\nthat your betters should have the start of you,” said the merchant, who\ndid him justice in the glass, and counselled him to drown his\nimpatience with good claret. The youth followed his advice, and it was\nlate before the company retired to rest."

The old gentleman\nwould fain have cracked a joke upon their extraordinary despatch, but\nhe was so much overawed by the dignity and tamed by the sweetness of\nSerafina’s carriage, that he durst not give utterance to his\nconception; and Valentine stood silent and abashed, as in the presence\nof a superior being. After breakfast these gentlemen and Charlotte\nagain expressed their sense of the obligations they owed to this happy\nfamily, repeated their invitation, and, taking leave, returned to\nLondon in a coach that was provided overnight.Our friends being thus left to themselves, Don Diego turned towards\nMelvil: “Now,” said he, “that I have yielded to the impatience of your\nlove, as well as to the eagerness of my own desire to make you happy, I\nmust beg leave to interrupt, for a little while, the stream of your\nmutual pleasure, and propose a melancholy excursion, which, however,\nwill not be wholly void of enjoyment. I have too long delayed the\nperformance of my duty at Antonia’s grave—let us spend the forenoon in\nthat pious pilgrimage—I will drop a few tears to the memory of that\nexcellent woman, and never afterwards shall my friends be troubled with\nmy grief.”The proposal being universally approved, they set out for the place,\nwhich had oft been visited by the gentle Serafina, who conducted her\nfather to a black marble stone, which Renaldo had ordered to be laid\nover the grave; and, as he kneeled to kiss the monument, he perceived\nthis plain inscription in the Spanish tongue:—Antonia de Zelos primera\nen todo lo que es ser bueno, y sin segundo en todo lo que fue ser\ndesdichado, quedad con Dios! that is, Antonia de Zelos, unmatched in\nvirtue, and unequalled in misfortune, adieu! “O faithful record!” cried\nthe Castilian, smiting his breast, while his tears distilled upon the\nmarble, “thy goodness was the gift of Heaven, but thy misfortunes were\nderived from the guilt of Don Diego; yet his sorrow shall expiate his\noffence, and his penitence find favour in the sight of Heaven! Rest,\nrest, ill-fated virtue!—eternal peace shall guard thy tomb, and angels\nminister to thy unspotted shade; nor shall thine ashes lie in dark\nobscurity here will I raise a monument, more suited to thy excellence\nand name.” Serafina melted with filial tenderness; nor were the rest\nunmoved at this affecting scene, which Don Diego did not quit without\nreluctance.CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVENTHE LONGEST AND THE LAST."

  "content": "The nature of this visit had softened every heart, and saddened every\ncountenance; and they walked in solemn silence to the other side of the\nchurch-yard, in order to regain their carriages; when, at the turning\nof the stile, they saw a young woman, in wretched attire, running out\nof a poor habitation, wringing her hands in all the agony of despair.\nNotwithstanding the distraction in her countenance, and the meanness of\nher apparel, she discovered a regularity of features, and a delicacy of\nair, which did not at all correspond with the misery of her equipage.\nThese exhibitions of extreme distress soon attracted the notice and\ncompassion of our company, and Melvil’s beauteous help-mate, accosting\nthis forlorn damsel with a pity-breathing aspect, asked the cause of\nher disorder.“Alas! dear lady,” cried the other, with all the emphasis of woe, “an\nunhappy gentleman now breathes his last within this inhospitable hovel,\namidst such excess of misery as would melt the most flinty bosom. What\nthen must I feel, who am connected with him by the strongest ties of\nlove and conjugal affection?” “Who is the unfortunate object?” said the\nphysician. “He was once well known in the gay world,” replied the young\nwoman; “his name is Fathom.” Every individual of the company started at\nmention of that detested name. Serafina began to tremble with emotion;\nand Renaldo, after a short pause, declared he would go in, not with a\nview to exult over his misery, but in order to contemplate the\ncatastrophe of such a wicked life, that the moral might be the more\ndeeply engraved on his remembrance. The young Countess, whose tender\nheart could not bear the shock of such a spectacle, retired to the\ncoach with Madam Clement and the Jew, while Renaldo, accompanied by the\nrest, entered a dismal apartment, altogether void of furniture and\nconvenience, where they beheld the wretched hero of these memoirs\nstretched almost naked upon straw, insensible, convulsed, and seemingly\nin the grasp of death. He was worn to the bone either by famine or\ndistemper; his face was overshadowed with hair and filth; his eyes were\nsunk, glazed, and distorted; his nostrils dilated; his lips covered\nwith a black slough; and his complexion faded into a pale clay-colour,\ntending to a yellow hue. In a word, the extremity of indigence,\nsqualor, and distress could not be more feelingly represented."

  "content": "While Melvil perused this melancholy lesson, and groaning, cried,\n“Behold the fate of man!” he perceived a letter in the right hand of\nthe unfortunate Fathom, which lay fast clenched across his breast.\nCurious to know the contents of this paper, which the young woman said\nhe had kept in that position for several days, he drew nearer the\nwretched couch, and was not a little surprised to see it addressed to\nthe Right Honourable Renaldo Count de Melvil, to the care of Mr. Joshua\nManesseh, merchant in London. When he attempted to disengage this\nbillet from the author’s hand, the sorrowing female fell upon her\nknees, entreating him to desist, and telling him, she had promised,\nupon oath, to communicate the contents to no person upon earth, but to\ncarry the letter, upon her husband’s decease, to the gentleman to whose\ncare it was directed.Renaldo assured her, upon his honour, that he was the very Renaldo\nCount de Melvil, for whom it was intended; and the young creature was\nso much confounded at this information, that, before she could\nrecollect herself, Melvil had opened the billet, and read these words:\n“If this paper should fall into the hands of the noble Renaldo, he will\nunderstand, that Fathom was the most execrable traitor that ever\nimposed upon unsuspecting benevolence, or attempted to betray a\ngenerous benefactor. His whole life was a series of fraud, perfidy, and\nthe most abominable ingratitude. But, of all the crimes that lay heavy\nupon his soul, his being accessory to the death of the incomparable\nSerafina, whose father he had also robbed, was that for which he\ndespaired of Heaven’s forgiveness, notwithstanding the dreadful\ncompunction and remorse which have long preyed upon his heart, together\nwith the incredible misery and deplorable death which by this time he\nhath undergone. Though these sufferings and sorrows cannot atone for\nhis enormous guilt, perhaps they will excite the compassion of the\nhumane Count de Melvil; at least, this confession, which my conscience\ndictates under all the terrors of death and futurity, may be a warning\nfor him to avoid henceforth a smiling villain, like the execrable\nFathom, upon whose miserable soul Almighty God have mercy.”"

  "content": "Renaldo was deeply affected with the contents of this scroll, which\ndenoted such horror and despair. He saw there could be no dissimulation\nor sinister design in this profession of penitence. He beheld the\ncondition of the writer, which put all his humane passions in\ncommotion; so that he remembered nothing of Fathom but his present\ndistress. He could scarce maintain those indications which might have\nbeen justly deemed the effect of weakness and infirmity; and having\ndesired the physician and clergyman to contribute their assistance for\nthe benefit of that wretch’s soul and body, he ran to the coach, and\ncommunicated the letter to the ladies; at the same time drawing a\npicture of the object he had seen, which brought tears into the eyes of\nthe gentle Serafina, who earnestly entreated her lord to use his\nendeavours for the relief and recovery of the unhappy man, that he\nmight, if possible, live to enjoy the benefit of mature repentance, and\nnot die in that dreadful despair which he manifested in the letter.Renaldo, returning to the house, found the pious clergyman reading\nprayers with great fervency, while Don Diego stood with his right hand\nupon his breast, looking steadfastly upon the agonising Fathom, and the\nyoung woman kneeled, with her streaming eyes lifted up to heaven, in an\necstasy of grief and devotion. The physician had run to an apothecary’s\nshop in the neighbourhood, from whence he soon returned with an\nassistant, who applied a large blister to the back of the miserable\npatient, while the female, by the doctor’s direction, moistened his\nmouth with a cordial which he had prescribed.These charitable steps being taken, Count de Melvil entreated the\napothecary’s servant to procure a tent-bed for the accommodation of the\nsick person with all imaginable despatch; and, in less than an hour,\none was actually pitched, and Fathom lifted into it, after he had been\nshifted, and in some measure purified from the dregs of his indigence.\nDuring this transaction the ladies were conducted to a tavern not far\noff, where dinner was bespoke, that they might be at hand to see the\neffect of their charity, which was not confined to what we have already\ndescribed, but extended so far, that, in a little time, the apartment\nwas comfortably furnished, and the young creature provided with change\nof apparel, and money to procure the necessaries of subsistence.Notwithstanding all their care, the wretched Fathom still remained\ninsensible, and the doctor pronounced a very unfavourable prognostic,\nwhile he ordered a pair of additional vesicatories to be laid upon his\narms, and other proper medicines to be administered. After dinner, the\nladies ventured to visit the place, and when Serafina crossed the\nthreshold, the weeping female fell at her feet, and, kissing her robe,\nexclaimed, “Sure you are an angel from heaven.”"

  "content": "The alteration in her dress had made a very agreeable change in her\nappearance, so that the Countess could now look upon her without\nshuddering at her distress. And, as Fathom was not in a condition to be\ndisturbed, she took this opportunity of inquiring by what steps that\nunfortunate wretch was conveyed from the prison, in which she knew he\nhad been confined, to the place where he now lay in such extremity; and\nby what occurrence he had found a wife in such an abyss of misfortune.\nHere the other’s tears began to flow afresh. “I am ashamed,” said she,\n“to reveal my own folly; yet I dare not refuse a satisfaction of this\nkind to a person who has laid me under such signal obligations.”"
