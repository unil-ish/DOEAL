  "content": "With this view, he one day presented himself at court in a very gay\nsuit of clothes, and bowed, at a distance, to many of his old\nfashionable friends of both sexes, not one of whom favoured him with\nany other notice, than that of a quarter curtsey, or slight inclination\nof the head. For, by this time, the few that remembered him knew from\nwhat retirement he now emerged, and avoided him accordingly as the jail\ninfection. But the greater part of those who had cultivated him in the\nzenith of his fortune were now utter strangers to his person, which\nthey had actually forgot, amidst the succession of novelties that\nsurrounded them; or, if they did recollect his name, it was remembered\nas an old fashion which had been many months out of date.Notwithstanding these mortifying discouragements, our hero, that same\nevening, effected a lodgment in a certain gaming-house not far from St.\nJames’s; and, as he played pretty high, and made a parade of his ready\nmoney, he was soon recognised by divers persons of consequence, who\ncordially welcomed him to England, on pretence of believing he had been\nabroad, and with great complacency repeated their former professions of\nfriendship. Though this was a certain way of retaining the favour of\nthose worthies, while his finances continued to flourish, and his\npayments were prompt, he knew the weakness of his funds too well, to\nthink they could bear the vicissitudes of play; and the remembrance of\nthe two British knights who had spoiled him at Paris, hung over his\nimagination with the most frightful presages. Besides, he perceived\nthat gaming was now managed in such a manner, as rendered skill and\ndexterity of no advantage. For the spirit of play having overspread the\nland, like a pestilence, raged to such a degree of madness and\ndesperation, that the unhappy people who were infected, laid aside all\nthoughts of amusement, economy, or caution, and risked their fortunes\nupon issues equally extravagant, childish, and absurd."

  "content": "The whole mystery of the art was reduced to the simple exercise of\ntossing up a guinea, and the lust of laying wagers, which they indulged\nto a surprising pitch of ridiculous intemperance. In one corner of the\nroom might be heard a pair of lordlings running their grandmothers\nagainst each other, that is, betting sums on the longest liver; in\nanother the success of the wager depended upon the sex of the\nlandlady’s next child; and one of the waiters happening to drop down in\nan apoplectic fit, a certain noble peer exclaimed, “Dead for a thousand\npounds.” The challenge was immediately accepted; and when the master of\nthe house sent for a surgeon to attempt the cure, the nobleman, who set\nthe price upon the patient’s head, insisted upon his being left to the\nefforts of nature alone, otherwise the wager should be void. Nay, when\nthe landlord harped upon the loss he should sustain by the death of a\ntrusty servant, his lordship obviated the objection, by desiring that\nthe fellow might be charged in the bill.In short, the rage of gaming seemed to have devoured all their other\nfaculties, and to have equalled the rash enthusiasm of the inhabitants\nof Malacca in the East Indies, who are so possessed with that\npernicious spirit, that they sacrifice to it not only their fortunes,\nbut also their wives and children; and then letting their hair down\nupon their shoulders, in imitation of the ancient Lacedaemonians when\nthey devoted themselves to death, those wretches unsheathe their\ndaggers, and murder every living creature in their way. In this,\nhowever, they differ from the gamesters of our country, who never find\ntheir senses, until they have lost their fortunes, and beggared their\nfamilies; whereas the Malays never run amuck, but in consequence of\nmisery and despair.Such are the amusements, or rather such is the continual employment of\nthose hopeful youths who are destined by birth to be the judges of our\nproperty, and pillars of our constitution. Such are the heirs and\nrepresentatives of those patriots who planned, and those heroes who\nmaintained, the laws and freedom of their country; who were the patrons\nof merit, the fathers of the poor, the terror of vice and immorality,\nand at once the ornaments and support of a happy nation.Our adventurer considered all these circumstances with his wonted\nsagacity, and, seeing upon what precarious footing he must stand,\nshould he rank himself with such society, he wisely came to the\nresolution of descending one step in the degrees of life, and of taking\nupon him the title of physician, under which he did not despair of\ninsinuating himself into the pockets of his patients, and into the\nsecrets of private families, so as to acquire a comfortable share of\npractice, or captivate the heart of some heiress or rich widow, whose\nfortune would at once render him independent and happy."

  "content": "After this determination, his next care was to concert measures for his\nfirst appearance in this new character; well knowing, that the success\nof a physician, in a great measure, depends upon the external equipage\nin which he first declares himself an adept in the healing art. He\nfirst of all procured a few books on the subject of medicine, which he\nstudied with great attention during the remaining part of the winter\nand spring, and repaired to Tunbridge with the first of the season,\nwhere he appeared in the uniform of Aesculapius, namely, a plain suit,\nfull trimmed, with a voluminous tie-periwig; believing that in this\nplace he might glide, as it were, imperceptibly into the functions of\nhis new employment, and gradually accustom himself to the method and\nform of prescription.A man so well known in the gay world could not be supposed to effect\nsuch a transformation without being observed; and therefore, in order\nto anticipate the censure and ridicule of those who might be tempted to\nmake themselves merry at his expense, he, on his arrival at the wells,\nrepaired to the shop of an apothecary, and calling for pen, ink, and\npaper, wrote a prescription, which he desired might be immediately made\nup. While this was doing by the servant, he was invited into a parlour\nby the master, with whom he entered into conversation touching the\nproperties of the Tunbridge water, which seemed to have been his\nparticular study; and indeed he had perused Rouzee’s treatise on that\nsubject with indefatigable assiduity. From this theme, he made\ndigressions into other parts of medicine, upon which he spoke with such\nplausible elocution, that the apothecary, whose knowledge in that art\nwas not very profound, looked upon him as a physician of great learning\nand experience, and hinted a desire of knowing his name and situation.Fathom accordingly gave him to understand, that he had studied physic,\nand taken his degrees at Padua, rather for his amusement, than with any\nview of exercising medicine, as he then could not possibly foresee the\nmisfortunes which had since happened to his family, and by which he was\nnow compelled to have recourse to a profession that was very much\nbeneath the expectations of his birth. Yet he bore his disappointments\nwith resignation, and even good-humour, and blessed his stars for\nhaving inclined him to the study of any branch of knowledge by which he\nmight be enabled to laugh at the vicissitudes of fortune. He then\nobserved, that he had practised with some applause at the hot well near\nBristol, before he thought he should be ever reduced to the necessity\nof taking a fee, and that, in all probability, his metamorphosis, when\nknown, would furnish matter of surprise and merriment to some of his\nold acquaintance."

  "content": "The apothecary was equally struck with his polite address, and pleased\nwith his agreeable discourse. He consoled him for the misfortunes of\nhis family, by assuring him, that in England nothing could be more\nhonourable, or indeed profitable, than the character of a physician,\nprovided he could once wriggle himself into practice; and insinuated,\nthat, although he was restricted by certain engagements with other\npersons of the faculty, he should be glad of an opportunity to show his\nregard for Doctor Fathom. This was a very effectual method which our\nhero took to intimate his new character to the public. By the industry\nand communicative disposition of the apothecary, it was circulated in\nhalf a day through every family in the place; and, next morning, when\nFerdinand appeared, the company forthwith assembled in separate groups,\nand from each knot he heard his name reverberated in a whisper.Having thus announced himself to all whom it might concern, and allowed\nthe ladies two days to discuss the merit of his transfiguration,\ntogether with the novelty of the case, he ventured to salute, at a\ndistance, a lady and her daughter, who had been his patients at the hot\nwell; and, although they honoured his bow with the return of a slight\ncurtsey, they gave him not the least encouragement to make a nearer\napproach. Notwithstanding this rebuff, he concluded, that, should the\nhealth of either come in question, they would renew their application\nto his skill, and what was refused by their pride would be granted by\ntheir apprehension. Here, however, he happened to be mistaken in his\nconjecture.The young lady being seized with a violent headache and palpitation,\nher mother desired the apothecary to recommend a physician; and the\nperson with whom he was contracted being at that time absent, he\nproposed Doctor Fathom as a man of great ability and discretion. But\nthe good lady rejected the proposal with disdain, because she had\nformerly known him in the character of a Count—though that very\ncharacter was the chief reason that had then induced her to crave his\nadvice."

  "content": "Such is the caprice of the world in general, that whatever bears the\nface of novelty captivates, or rather bewitches, the imagination, and\nconfounds the ideas of reason and common sense. If, for example, a\nscullion, from the clinking of pewter, shall conceive a taste for the\nclinking of rhyme, and make shift to bring together twenty syllables,\nso as that the tenth and last shall have the like ending, the\ncomposition is immediately extolled as a miracle; and what appeals to\nthe admiration is not the wit, the elegance, or poetry of the work, but\nthe uncultivated talent and humble station of the author. A reader does\nnot exclaim, “What a delicate sentiment! what a beautiful simile! what\neasy and musical versification!”—but cries in rapture, “Heavens! what a\nprodigy a poet from the scullery! a muse in livery! or, Apollo with a\ntrowel!”—The public is astonished into liberality—the scullion eats\nfrom those trenchers he scoured before—the footman is admitted into the\ncoach behind which he was wont to stand—and the bricklayer, instead of\nplastering walls, bedaubs his illustrious partner with the mortar of\nhis praise. Thus, lifted into a higher sphere, their talents receive\ncultivation; they become professed bards, and though their subsequent\nworks bear evident marks of improvement, they are neglected among the\nrest of their brethren, because that novelty, which recommended them in\nthe beginning, no longer remains.So it fared with our adventurer in his new occupation. There was\nsomething so extraordinary in a nobleman’s understanding medicine, and\nso uncommon in a physician’s prescribing gratis, that the curiosity and\nadmiration of the company at Bristol were engaged, and they followed\nhis advice, as the direction of some supernatural intelligence. But,\nnow that he professed himself one of the faculty, and might be supposed\nto have refreshed his memory, and reinforced his knowledge for the\noccasion, he was as much overlooked as any other physician unsupported\nby interest or cabal; or, at least, the notice he attracted was not at\nall to the advantage of his character, because it wholly regarded the\ndecline of his fortune, which is a never-failing fund of disgrace."

  "content": "These mortifications did not overcome the patience and perseverance of\nFathom, who foresaw, that the soothing hand of time would cast a veil\nof oblivion over those scenes which were remembered to his prejudice;\nand that, in the meantime, though he was excluded from the private\nparties of the fair sex, in which his main hope of success was placed,\nhe should be able to insinuate himself into some degree of favour and\npractice among the male patients; and some lucky cure, properly\ndisplayed, might be the means of propagating his fame, and banishing\nthat reserve which at present interfered with his purpose. Accordingly,\nit was not long before he found means to break that spell of universal\nprejudice that hedged him in. At the ordinary which he frequented, his\npolite carriage, facetious remarks, and agreeable stories soon\nconciliated the regard of his fellow-guests, among whom he sometimes\nrallied his own transformation with singular good-humour and success.\nHe was even witty upon his want of employment, and used to observe,\nthat a physician without practice had one comfort to which his brethren\nwere strangers, namely, that the seldomer he had occasion to prescribe,\nthe less he had upon his conscience on account of being accessory to\nthe death of his fellow-creatures.Nothing so effectually blunts the shafts of ridicule, and defeats the\naims of slander, as this method of anticipation. In spite of the arrows\nthat were levelled against his reputation from every tea-table at\nTunbridge, he made his party good among almost all the gay young\ngentlemen that frequented the place. Far from avoiding his company,\nthey began to court his conversation, and he was commonly seen in the\nwalks surrounded with a group of admirers.Having thus paved the way for a total removal of the invidious\nprepossession that obstructed his views, he, one night, while every\nperson was lulled in the arms of repose, and universal silence\nprevailed, tuned his violin, and began to play some masterly airs, in a\ntone so uncommonly expressive, and with such ravishing dexterity of\nexecution, that a certain lady, who lodged in the same house, being\nwaked by the music, and ignorant of the source from which it flowed,\nlistened with rapture, as to the harp of an angel, and, wrapping\nherself in a loose gown, rose and opened her chamber door, in order to\ndiscover in what apartment the musician resided. She no sooner entered\nthe passage, than she found her fellow-lodgers already assembled on the\nsame occasion; and there they remained during the best part of the\nnight, transported by the harmony which our hero produced.Doctor Fathom was immediately known to be the author of this\nentertainment; and thus retrieved the benefit of that admiration which\nhe had forfeited by appearing in the shape of a physician. For, as\npeople had formerly wondered to see a count skilled in medicine, they\nwere now amazed to find a physician such a master in music."

  "content": "The good effects of this stratagem were almost instantaneous. His\nperformance became the topic of discourse among all the fashionable\ncompany. His male friends complimented him from the information of the\nother sex; and that lady whom he had regaled, instead of that shyness\nand disdain with which she used to receive his salutation, at their\nvery next meeting in the thoroughfare, returned his bow with marks of\nprofound respect. Nay, at midnight, she, with the rest, took post in\nthe same place where they had been stationed before; and, by frequent\ntittering, and repeated whispers, gave intimation to Fathom, that they\nwould be glad of a second serenade. But he was too well acquainted with\nthe human passions to indulge this their desire. It was his interest to\ninflame their impatience, rather than to gratify their expectation; and\ntherefore he tantalised them for some hours, by tuning his violin, and\nplaying some flourishes, which, however, produced nothing to fulfil\ntheir wishes.At the ordinary, he was accosted by a gentleman, a lodger in the same\nhouse, who assured him, that the ladies would take it as a great favour\nif he would let them know when he intended to amuse himself again with\nhis instrument, that they might not, by falling asleep beforehand,\ndeprive themselves of the pleasure of hearing his music. To this\nmessage he replied, with an air of consequence and reserve, that,\nthough music was not the art he professed, he should be always\ncomplaisant enough to entertain the ladies to the utmost of his power,\nwhen their commands were signified to him in a manner suited to his\ncharacter; but that he would never put himself on the footing of an\nitinerate harper, whose music is tolerated through the medium of a\nboard partition. The gentleman having reported this answer to his\nconstituents, they empowered him to invite Doctor Fathom to breakfast,\nand he was next morning introduced with the usual ceremony, and treated\nwith uncommon regard by all the females of the house, assembled for his\nreception.Having thus broken the ice of their aversion in one part, so as that\nthe beams of his personal accomplishments had room to operate, he soon\neffected a general thaw in his favour, and found himself growing once\nmore into request amongst the most amiable part of the creation. His\ncompany was coveted, and his taste consulted in their balls, concerts,\nand private assemblies; and he recompensed the regard they paid to him\nwith an incessant exertion of his agreeable talents, politeness, and\ngood-humour.CHAPTER FIFTY-ONETRIUMPHS OVER A MEDICAL RIVAL."

  "content": "Yet, in the midst of all this attention, his medical capacity seemed to\nbe quite forgot. They respected his good breeding, were charmed with\nhis voice, and admired the fine touches of his hand upon the violin;\nbut in cultivating the fiddler, they utterly neglected the physician;\nand in vain did he attempt to divide their regard, by taking all\nopportunities to turn the conversation into a more interesting channel.\nIt was to little purpose he endeavoured to arouse the wonder of his\naudience with frequent descriptions of portentous maladies and amazing\ncures he had seen and performed in the course of his study and practice\nabroad; and to no effect did he publicly busy himself in making\nexperiments on the mineral water, in which he pretended to have made\nseveral new and important discoveries. These efforts did not make a\nlasting impression upon the minds of the company; because they saw\nnothing surprising in a physician’s being acquainted with all the\nmysteries of his art; and, as their custom was already bespoke for\nothers of the profession, whom it was their interest to employ, our\nadventurer might have starved amidst the caresses of his acquaintance,\nhad not he derived considerable advantage from a lucky accident in the\ncourse of his expectancy.A gentlewoman’s daughter, of a weakly constitution, by drinking the\nwaters, had so far recovered her health and complexion, as to allure\nthe affection of a young squire in the neighbourhood, who amused her\nfor some time with his addresses, until his heart was seduced by the\ncharms of another young lady lately arrived at the wells. The forsaken\nnymph, shocked at this disgrace and mortification, relapsed into her\nformer languishing disorder; and was by her mother put under the\nmanagement and prescription of a physician, who had been an industrious\nenemy of Fathom from his first appearance at Tunbridge. The patient,\nthough violently chagrined at the levity of her quondam admirer, was\nnot altogether without hope, that the very same inconstancy which had\nprompted him to leave her, might in time induce him to return, after\nthe novelty of his new passion should be wore off; and this hope served\nto support her under the sorrow and disgrace of her disappointment. At\nlength, however, the squire and his new mistress disappeared; and some\nbusybody was officious enough to communicate this piece of news to the\nforlorn shepherdess, with this additional circumstance, that they were\ngone to a neighbouring parish to be joined in the bands of wedlock."

  "content": "These fatal tidings were no sooner imparted to the abandoned Phillis,\nthan she was seized with an hysteric fit; and, what rendered the\naccident more unfortunate, her physician had been called to the\ncountry, and was not expected at Tunbridge till next day. The\napothecary was immediately summoned; and, being either puzzled by the\nsymptoms, or afraid of encroaching upon the province of his superiors,\nadvised the old lady to send for Doctor Fathom without delay. She had\nno other objection to this expedient, but the enmity which she knew\nsubsisted between the two leeches; yet, hearing that her own doctor\nwould not consult with Fathom upon his return but, perhaps renounce the\npatient, by which means her daughter’s health might be endangered, she\nwould not solicit our hero’s assistance, until the young lady had\nremained seven hours speechless and insensible; when, her fear\nprevailing over every other consideration, she implored the advice of\nour adventurer, who, having made the necessary interrogations, and felt\nthe patient’s pulse, which was regular and distinct, found reason to\nconclude that the fit would not last much longer, and, after having\nobserved that she was in a very dangerous way, prescribed some\nmedicines for external application; and, to enhance their opinion of\nhis diligence and humanity, resolved to stay in the room and observe\ntheir effect.His judgment did not fail him on this occasion. In less than half an\nhour after his embrocations had been applied, she recovered the use of\nher tongue, opened her eyes, and having, in delirious exclamations,\nupbraided her perfidious lover, became quite sensible and composed,\nthough she continued extremely low and dejected. To remedy these\nsinkings, certain cordials were immediately administered, according to\nthe prescription of Doctor Fathom, upon whom extraordinary encomiums\nwere bestowed by all present, who believed he had actually rescued her\nfrom the jaws of death; and as he was by this time let into the secrets\nof the family, he found himself in a fair way of being an egregious\nfavourite of the old gentlewoman; when, unluckily, his brother, having\ndismissed his country patient with uncommon despatch, entered the\napartment, and eyed his rival with looks of inexpressible rage; then,\nsurveying the patient, and the phials that stood upon the table, by\nturns, “What, in the name of God!” cried he, “is the meaning of all\nthis trash!”“Really, doctor,” replied the mother, a little confounded at being thus\ntaken by surprise, “Biddy has been taken dangerously ill, and lain\nseven or eight hours in a severe fit, from which I am confident she\nwould never have recovered without the help of a physician; and as you\nwere absent, we had recourse to this gentleman, whose prescription hath\nhad a happy and surprising effect.” “Effect!” cried this offended\nmember of the faculty, “pshaw!—stuff!—who made you judge of effects or\ncauses?” Then advancing to the patient, “What has been the matter, Miss\nBiddy, that you could not wait till my return?”"

Nor is there one physician of note in this\nkingdom who has not derived the greatest part of his medical knowledge\nfrom the instructions of foreigners.”Looby, incensed at this asseveration, which he was not prepared to\nrefute, exclaimed, in a most infuriate accent, “Who are you?—whence\ncame you?—where was you bred? You are one of those, I believe, who\ngraduate themselves, and commence doctors, the Lord knows how; an\ninterloper, who, without licence or authority, comes hither to take the\nbread out of the mouths of gentlemen who have been trained to the\nbusiness in a regular manner, and bestowed great pains and expense to\nqualify themselves for the profession. For my own part, my education\ncost me fifteen hundred pounds.”"

You have even debased\nthe noblest and most beneficial art that ever engaged the study of\nmankind, which cannot be too much cultivated, and too little\nrestrained, in seeking to limit the practice of it to a set of\nnarrow-minded, illiberal wretches, who, like the lowest handicraftsmen,\nclaim the exclusive privileges of a corporation. Had you doubted my\nability, you ought to have satisfied yourself in a manner consistent\nwith decency and candour; but your behaviour on this occasion is such a\nmalicious outrage upon good manners and humanity, that, were it not for\nmy regard to these ladies, I would chastise you for your insolence on\nthe spot. Meanwhile, madam,” addressing himself to the mother, “you\nmust give me leave to insist upon your dismissing either that\ngentleman, or me, without hesitation.”This peremptory language had an instantaneous effect upon the hearers.\nLooby’s face grew pale, and his nether lip began to tremble. The\npatient was dismayed, and the old gentlewoman concerned and perplexed.\nShe earnestly besought the gentlemen to be reconciled to each other,\nand enter into a friendly consultation upon her daughter’s distemper;\nbut, finding both equally averse to accommodation, and Fathom becoming\nmore and more importunate in his demand, she presented him with a\ndouble fee; and giving him to understand that Doctor Looby had long\nattended the family, and was intimately acquainted with her own and\nBiddy’s constitution, said, she hoped he would not take it amiss if she\nretained her old physician.Though our hero was much mortified at this triumph of his rival, he\nmade a virtue of necessity, and retired with great complaisance,\nwishing that Miss Biddy might never again be the subject of such a\ndisagreeable dispute. Whether the patient was frighted at this\naltercation, or displeased with her mother’s decision against an\nagreeable young fellow, who had, as it were, recalled her from the\ngrave, and made himself master of the secret that rankled at her heart,\nor the disease had wound up her nerves for another paroxysm, certain it\nis, she all of a sudden broke forth into a violent peal of laughter,\nwhich was succeeded by the most doleful cries, and other expressions of\ngrief; then she relapsed into a fit, attended with strong convulsions,\nto the unspeakable terror of the old gentlewoman, who entreated Doctor\nLooby to be expeditious in his prescription.

For\nthe more remedies that were administered, her convulsions became the\nmore violent; and in spite of all his endeavours, he could not overcome\nthe obstinacy of the distemper. Such a miscarriage, upon the back of\nhis rival’s success, could not fail to overwhelm him with confusion;\nespecially as the mother baited him with repeated entreaties to do\nsomething for the recovery of her daughter. At length, after having\nexercised her patience in vain for several hours, this affectionate\nparent could no longer suppress the suggestions of her concern, but, in\nan incoherent strain, told him that her duty would not suffer her to be\nlonger silent in an affair on which depended the life of her dear\nchild. That she had seen enough to believe he had mistaken the case of\npoor Biddy, and he could not justly blame her for recalling Doctor\nFathom, whose prescription had operated in a miraculous manner.Looby, shocked at this proposal, protested against it with great\nvehemence, as an expedient highly injurious to himself. “My remedies,”\nsaid he, “are just beginning to take effect, and, in all probability,\nthe fit will not last much longer; so that, by calling in another\nperson at this juncture, you will defraud me of that credit which is my\ndue, and deck my adversary with trophies to which he has no\npretension.” She was prevailed upon, by this remonstrance, to wait\nanother half hour, when perceiving, as yet, no alteration for the\nbetter, and being distracted with her fears, which reproached her with\nwant of natural affection, she sent a message to Doctor Fathom,\ndesiring to see him with all possible despatch.He was not slow in obeying the call, but hastening to the scene of\naction, was not a little surprised to find Looby still in the\napartment. This gentleman, since better might not be, resolved to\nsacrifice his pride to his interest, and, rather than lose his patient\naltogether, and run the risk of forfeiting his reputation at the same\ntime, stayed with intention to compromise his difference with Fathom,\nthat he might not be wholly excluded from the honour of the cure, in\ncase it could be effected. But he had reckoned without his host in his\ncalculation of the Count’s placability; for, when he put on his\ncapitulating face, and, after a slight apology for his late behaviour,\nproposed that all animosity should subside in favour of the young lady,\nwhose life was at stake, our hero rejected his advances with infinite\ndisdain, and assured the mother, in a very solemn tone, that, far from\nconsulting with a man who had treated him so unworthily, he would not\nstay another minute in the house, unless he should see him discarded; a\nsatisfaction barely sufficient to atone for the affront he himself had\nsuffered by the unjust preference she had before given to his rival."

Looby was obliged to retreat in his turn; then our\nadventurer, approaching the bedside, reconnoitred the patient, examined\nthe medicines which had been administered, and lifting up his eyes in\nexpressive silence, detached the footman with a new order to the\napothecary. It was well the messenger used expedition, otherwise Doctor\nFathom would have been anticipated by the operation of nature; for, the\nfit having almost run its career, Miss Biddy was on the point of\nretrieving her senses, when the frontal prescribed by Fathom was\napplied; to the efficacy of this, therefore, was ascribed her recovery,\nwhen she opened her eyes, and began to pour forth unconnected\nejaculations; and in a few moments after, she was persuaded to swallow\na draught prepared for the purpose, her perception returned, and\nFerdinand gained the reputation of having performed a second miracle.But he was furnished with a piece of intelligence, of much more energy\nthan all she had taken, and so soon as he concluded she was capable to\nbear the news without any dangerous emotion, he, among other articles\nof chit-chat culled for her amusement, took the opportunity of telling\nthe company, that Squire Stub (the cause of Miss Biddy’s disorder) had,\nin his way to matrimony, been robbed of his bride, by a gentleman to\nwhom she had been formerly engaged. He had waited for her on purpose at\nan inn on the road, where he found means to appease her displeasure,\nwhich he had, it seems, incurred, and to supersede her new lover, whom\nshe quitted without ceremony; upon which the squire had returned to\nTunbridge, cursing her levity, yet blessing his good stars for having\nso seasonably prevented his ruin, which would have infallibly been the\nconsequence of his marrying such an adventurer."

Fathom was not forgot amidst the rejoicings of the family.\nBesides an handsome gratuity for the effects of his extraordinary\nskill, the old lady favoured him with a general invitation to her\nhouse, and the daughter not only considered him as the restorer of her\nhealth, and angel of her good fortune, but also began to discover an\nuncommon relish for his conversation; so that he was struck with the\nprospect of succeeding Squire Stub in her affection. A conquest which,\nif sanctioned by the approbation of the mother, would console him for\nall the disappointments he had sustained; for Miss Biddy was entitled\nto a fortune of ten thousand pounds, provided she should marry with the\nconsent of her parent, who was the sole executrix of the father’s will.Animated with the hope of such an advantageous match, our adventurer\nmissed no opportunity of improving the lodgment he had made, while the\ntwo ladies failed not to extol his medical capacity among all their\nfemale acquaintances. By means of this circulation, his advice was\ndemanded in several other cases, which he managed with such an imposing\nair of sagacity and importance, that his fame began to spread, and\nbefore the end of the season, he had ravished more than one half of the\nbusiness from his competitor. Notwithstanding these fortunate events,\nhe foresaw, that he should find great difficulty in transplanting his\nreputation, so as to take root in London, which was the only soil in\nwhich he could propose to rise to any degree of prosperity and\nindependence; and this reflection was grounded upon a maxim which\nuniversally prevails among the English people, namely, to overlook and\nwholly neglect, on their return to the metropolis, all the connexions\nthey may have chanced to acquire during their residence at any of the\nmedical wells. And this social disposition is so scrupulously\nmaintained, that two persons who lived in the most intimate\ncorrespondence at Bath or Tunbridge, shall in four-and-twenty hours so\ntotally forget their friendship, as to meet in St. James’s Park,\nwithout betraying the least token of recognition; so that one would\nimagine these mineral waters were so many streams issuing from the\nriver Lethe, so famed of old for washing away all traces of memory and\nrecollection."

In\ndisplaying his accomplishments to captivate the daughter, he had\nunwittingly made an absolute conquest of the mother, who superintended\nthe conduct of Miss Biddy with such jealous vigilance, that he could\nfind no opportunity of profiting by the progress he had made in her\nheart; for the careful matron would never lose sight of her, no, not\nfor one moment.Had the old lady given the least intimation to our adventurer, of the\nsentiments she entertained in his behalf, his complaisance was of such\na pliable texture, that he would have quitted his other pursuit, and\nmade her the sole object of his attention. But she either depended upon\nthe effect of his own good taste and discernment, or was too proud to\ndisclose a passion which he had hitherto overlooked.CHAPTER FIFTY-TWOREPAIRS TO THE METROPOLIS, AND ENROLS HIMSELF AMONG THE SONS OF PAEAN.Before this affair could be brought to a proper explanation, the season\nbeing almost ended, the ladies departed from Tunbridge, and in a little\ntime Doctor Fathom followed them to London, having previously obtained\npermission to visit them in that metropolis. He had solicited the same\nfavour of some other families, in which he hoped to take root, though\nhe knew they were pre-engaged to different physicians; and resolving to\nmake his first medical appearance in London with some eclat, he not\nonly purchased an old chariot, which was new painted for the purpose,\nbut likewise hired a footman, whom he clothed in laced livery, in order\nto distinguish himself from the common run of his brethren."

A chariot was not now set up for the convenience of a\nman sinking under the fatigue of extensive practice, but as a piece of\nfurniture every way as necessary as a large periwig with three tails;\nand a physician, let his merit, in other respects, be never so\nconspicuous, can no more expect to become considerable in business,\nwithout the assistance of this implement, than he can hope to live\nwithout food, or breathe without a windpipe.This requisite is so well understood, that, exclusive of those who\nprofess themselves doctors, every raw surgeon, every idle apothecary,\nwho can make interest with some foolhardy coachmaker, may be seen\ndancing the bays in all places of public resort, and grinning to one\nanother from their respective carriages. Hence proceed many of those\ncruel accidents which are recorded in the daily papers. An apothecary’s\nhorses take fright, and run away with his chariot, which is heard of no\nmore. An eminent surgeon being overturned, is so terrified at the\nthoughts of mutilation, that he resolves to walk on foot all the days\nof his life; and the coachman of a physician of great practice, having\nthe misfortune to be disabled by a fall from the box, his master can\nnever find another to supply his place.None of these observations escaped the penetrating eye of Fathom, who,\nbefore he pretended to seat himself in this machine, had made proper\ninquiry into all the other methods practised, with a view to keep the\nwheels in motion. In his researches, he found that the great world was\nwholly engrossed by a few practitioners who had arrived at the summit\nof reputation, consequently were no longer obliged to cultivate those\narts by which they rose; and that the rest of the business was\nparcelled out into small enclosures, occupied by different groups of\npersonages, male and female, who stood in rings, and tossed the ball\nfrom one to another, there being in each department two sets, the\nindividuals of which relieved one another occasionally. Every knot was\ncomposed of a waiting-woman, nurse, apothecary, surgeon, and physician,\nand sometimes a midwife was admitted into the party; and in this manner\nthe farce was commonly performed."

Her favourite maid, tired with giving her attendance in the\nnight, thinks proper, for the benefit of her own repose, to complain of\na violent headache, and recommends to her mistress a nurse of approved\ntenderness and discretion; at whose house, in all likelihood, the said\nchambermaid hath oft given the rendezvous to a male friend. The nurse,\nwell skilled in the mysteries of her occupation, persuades the patient,\nthat her malady, far from being slight or chimerical, may proceed to a\nvery dangerous degree of the hysterical affection, unless it be nipt in\nthe bud by some very effectual remedy. Then she recounts a surprising\ncure performed by a certain apothecary, and appeals to the testimony of\nthe waiting-woman, who being the gossip of his wife, confirms the\nevidence, and corroborates the proposal. The apothecary being summoned,\nfinds her ladyship in such a delicate situation, that he declines\nprescribing, and advises her to send for a physician without delay. The\nnomination of course falls to him, and the doctor being called,\ndeclares the necessity of immediate venesection, which is accordingly\nperformed by a surgeon of the association.This is one way of beginning the game. Though the commencement often\nvaries, and sometimes the apothecary and sometimes the physician opens\nthe scene; but, be that as it will, they always appear in a string,\nlike a flight of wild geese, and each confederacy maintains a\ncorrespondence with one particular undertaker. Fathom, upon these\nconsiderations, set up his rest in the first floor of an apothecary in\nthe neighbourhood of Charing Cross, to whom he was introduced by a\nletter from a friend at Tunbridge, and who being made acquainted with\nhis ability and scheme, promised to let slip no opportunity of serving\nhim; and, indeed, seemed to espouse his interest with great alacrity.\nHe introduced him to some of his patients, on the strength of a gratis\nvisit, sounded forth his praise among all the good women of his\nacquaintance; and even prevailed upon him to publish advertisements,\nimporting that he would every day, at a certain time and place, give\nhis advice to the poor for nothing; hoping that, by means of some lucky\ncure, his fame might be extended, and his practice grow into request."

For the method of driving up\none street and down another, without halting, was become such a stale\nexpedient, that the very ’prentices used to stand at the shop doors,\nand ridicule the vain parade. At length, however, he perused the map of\nLondon with great diligence, and, having acquired a distinct idea of\nits topography, used to alight at the end of long narrow thoroughfares\nand paved courts, where the chariot was ordered to wait till his\nreturn; and, walking with great gravity through the different turnings\nof these alleys, regain his carriage by another passage, and resume his\nseat with an air of vast importance. With a view to protract the time\nof his supposed visits, he would, at one place, turn aside to a wall;\nat another, cheapen an urinal; at a third corner, read a quack\nadvertisement, or lounge a few minutes in some bookseller’s shop; and,\nlastly, glide into some obscure coffee-house, and treat himself with a\ndram of usquebaugh.The other means used to force a trade, such as ordering himself to be\ncalled from church, alarming the neighbourhood with knocking at his\ndoor in the night, receiving sudden messages in places of resort, and\ninserting his cures by way of news in the daily papers, had been so\ninjudiciously hackneyed by every desperate sculler in physic, that they\nhad lost their effect upon the public, and therefore were excluded from\nthe plan of our adventurer, whose scheme, for the present, was to exert\nhimself in winning the favour of those sage Sibyls, who keep, as it\nwere, the temple of medicine, and admit the young priest to the service\nof the altar; but this he considered as a temporary project only, until\nhe should have acquired interest enough to erect an hospital, lock, or\ninfirmary, by the voluntary subscription of his friends, a scheme which\nhad succeeded to a miracle with many of the profession, who had raised\nthemselves into notice upon the carcases of the poor.Yet even this branch was already overstocked, insomuch that almost\nevery street was furnished with one of these charitable receptacles,\nwhich, instead of diminishing the taxes for the maintenance of the\npoor, encouraged the vulgar to be idle and dissolute, by opening an\nasylum to them and their families, from the diseases of poverty and\nintemperance. For it remains to be proved, that the parish rates are\ndecreased, the bills of mortality lessened, the people more numerous,\nor the streets less infested with beggars, notwithstanding the immense\nsums yearly granted by individuals for the relief of the indigent."

So\nthat our hero got little else than experience and trouble, excepting a\nfew guineas which he made shift to glean among sojourners, with whom he\nbecame occasionally acquainted, or young people, who had been\nunfortunate in their amours.In the midst of these endeavours, he did not omit his duty to the old\ngentlewoman, whose daughter he had cured at Tunbridge; and was always\nreceived with particular complacency, which, perhaps, he, in some\nmeasure, owed to his genteel equipage, that gave credit to every door\nbefore which it was seen; yet, Miss Biddy was as inaccessible as ever,\nwhile the mother became more and more warm in her civilities, till at\nlength, after having prepared him with some extraordinary compliments,\nshe gave him to understand, that Biddy was no better than a\ngiddy-headed girl, far from being unexceptionable in her moral\ncharacter, and particularly deficient in duty and gratitude to her, who\nhad been always a tender and indulgent parent; she was therefore\ndetermined to punish the young minx for her levity and want of natural\naffection, by altering her own condition, could she find a worthy and\nagreeable man, on whom she could bestow her hand and fortune without a\nblush."
