  "content": "There was no remedy. Looby was obliged to retreat in his turn; then our\nadventurer, approaching the bedside, reconnoitred the patient, examined\nthe medicines which had been administered, and lifting up his eyes in\nexpressive silence, detached the footman with a new order to the\napothecary. It was well the messenger used expedition, otherwise Doctor\nFathom would have been anticipated by the operation of nature; for, the\nfit having almost run its career, Miss Biddy was on the point of\nretrieving her senses, when the frontal prescribed by Fathom was\napplied; to the efficacy of this, therefore, was ascribed her recovery,\nwhen she opened her eyes, and began to pour forth unconnected\nejaculations; and in a few moments after, she was persuaded to swallow\na draught prepared for the purpose, her perception returned, and\nFerdinand gained the reputation of having performed a second miracle.But he was furnished with a piece of intelligence, of much more energy\nthan all she had taken, and so soon as he concluded she was capable to\nbear the news without any dangerous emotion, he, among other articles\nof chit-chat culled for her amusement, took the opportunity of telling\nthe company, that Squire Stub (the cause of Miss Biddy’s disorder) had,\nin his way to matrimony, been robbed of his bride, by a gentleman to\nwhom she had been formerly engaged. He had waited for her on purpose at\nan inn on the road, where he found means to appease her displeasure,\nwhich he had, it seems, incurred, and to supersede her new lover, whom\nshe quitted without ceremony; upon which the squire had returned to\nTunbridge, cursing her levity, yet blessing his good stars for having\nso seasonably prevented his ruin, which would have infallibly been the\nconsequence of his marrying such an adventurer."

Fathom was not forgot amidst the rejoicings of the family.\nBesides an handsome gratuity for the effects of his extraordinary\nskill, the old lady favoured him with a general invitation to her\nhouse, and the daughter not only considered him as the restorer of her\nhealth, and angel of her good fortune, but also began to discover an\nuncommon relish for his conversation; so that he was struck with the\nprospect of succeeding Squire Stub in her affection. A conquest which,\nif sanctioned by the approbation of the mother, would console him for\nall the disappointments he had sustained; for Miss Biddy was entitled\nto a fortune of ten thousand pounds, provided she should marry with the\nconsent of her parent, who was the sole executrix of the father’s will.Animated with the hope of such an advantageous match, our adventurer\nmissed no opportunity of improving the lodgment he had made, while the\ntwo ladies failed not to extol his medical capacity among all their\nfemale acquaintances. By means of this circulation, his advice was\ndemanded in several other cases, which he managed with such an imposing\nair of sagacity and importance, that his fame began to spread, and\nbefore the end of the season, he had ravished more than one half of the\nbusiness from his competitor. Notwithstanding these fortunate events,\nhe foresaw, that he should find great difficulty in transplanting his\nreputation, so as to take root in London, which was the only soil in\nwhich he could propose to rise to any degree of prosperity and\nindependence; and this reflection was grounded upon a maxim which\nuniversally prevails among the English people, namely, to overlook and\nwholly neglect, on their return to the metropolis, all the connexions\nthey may have chanced to acquire during their residence at any of the\nmedical wells. And this social disposition is so scrupulously\nmaintained, that two persons who lived in the most intimate\ncorrespondence at Bath or Tunbridge, shall in four-and-twenty hours so\ntotally forget their friendship, as to meet in St. James’s Park,\nwithout betraying the least token of recognition; so that one would\nimagine these mineral waters were so many streams issuing from the\nriver Lethe, so famed of old for washing away all traces of memory and\nrecollection."

  "content": "Aware of this oblivious principle, Doctor Fathom collected all his\nqualifications, in order to make such an impression upon the heart of\nMiss Biddy, as would resist all her endeavours to shake him from her\nremembrance; and his efforts succeeded so well, that Squire Stub’s\nadvances to a reconciliation were treated with manifest indifference.\nIn all probability our hero would have made a very advantageous\ncampaign, had not his good fortune been retarded by an obstruction,\nwhich, as he did not perceive it, he could not possibly surmount. In\ndisplaying his accomplishments to captivate the daughter, he had\nunwittingly made an absolute conquest of the mother, who superintended\nthe conduct of Miss Biddy with such jealous vigilance, that he could\nfind no opportunity of profiting by the progress he had made in her\nheart; for the careful matron would never lose sight of her, no, not\nfor one moment.Had the old lady given the least intimation to our adventurer, of the\nsentiments she entertained in his behalf, his complaisance was of such\na pliable texture, that he would have quitted his other pursuit, and\nmade her the sole object of his attention. But she either depended upon\nthe effect of his own good taste and discernment, or was too proud to\ndisclose a passion which he had hitherto overlooked.CHAPTER FIFTY-TWOREPAIRS TO THE METROPOLIS, AND ENROLS HIMSELF AMONG THE SONS OF PAEAN.Before this affair could be brought to a proper explanation, the season\nbeing almost ended, the ladies departed from Tunbridge, and in a little\ntime Doctor Fathom followed them to London, having previously obtained\npermission to visit them in that metropolis. He had solicited the same\nfavour of some other families, in which he hoped to take root, though\nhe knew they were pre-engaged to different physicians; and resolving to\nmake his first medical appearance in London with some eclat, he not\nonly purchased an old chariot, which was new painted for the purpose,\nbut likewise hired a footman, whom he clothed in laced livery, in order\nto distinguish himself from the common run of his brethren."

A chariot was not now set up for the convenience of a\nman sinking under the fatigue of extensive practice, but as a piece of\nfurniture every way as necessary as a large periwig with three tails;\nand a physician, let his merit, in other respects, be never so\nconspicuous, can no more expect to become considerable in business,\nwithout the assistance of this implement, than he can hope to live\nwithout food, or breathe without a windpipe.This requisite is so well understood, that, exclusive of those who\nprofess themselves doctors, every raw surgeon, every idle apothecary,\nwho can make interest with some foolhardy coachmaker, may be seen\ndancing the bays in all places of public resort, and grinning to one\nanother from their respective carriages. Hence proceed many of those\ncruel accidents which are recorded in the daily papers. An apothecary’s\nhorses take fright, and run away with his chariot, which is heard of no\nmore. An eminent surgeon being overturned, is so terrified at the\nthoughts of mutilation, that he resolves to walk on foot all the days\nof his life; and the coachman of a physician of great practice, having\nthe misfortune to be disabled by a fall from the box, his master can\nnever find another to supply his place.None of these observations escaped the penetrating eye of Fathom, who,\nbefore he pretended to seat himself in this machine, had made proper\ninquiry into all the other methods practised, with a view to keep the\nwheels in motion. In his researches, he found that the great world was\nwholly engrossed by a few practitioners who had arrived at the summit\nof reputation, consequently were no longer obliged to cultivate those\narts by which they rose; and that the rest of the business was\nparcelled out into small enclosures, occupied by different groups of\npersonages, male and female, who stood in rings, and tossed the ball\nfrom one to another, there being in each department two sets, the\nindividuals of which relieved one another occasionally. Every knot was\ncomposed of a waiting-woman, nurse, apothecary, surgeon, and physician,\nand sometimes a midwife was admitted into the party; and in this manner\nthe farce was commonly performed."

  "content": "A fine lady, fatigued with idleness, complains of the vapours, is\ndeprived of her rest, though not so sick as to have recourse to\nmedicine. Her favourite maid, tired with giving her attendance in the\nnight, thinks proper, for the benefit of her own repose, to complain of\na violent headache, and recommends to her mistress a nurse of approved\ntenderness and discretion; at whose house, in all likelihood, the said\nchambermaid hath oft given the rendezvous to a male friend. The nurse,\nwell skilled in the mysteries of her occupation, persuades the patient,\nthat her malady, far from being slight or chimerical, may proceed to a\nvery dangerous degree of the hysterical affection, unless it be nipt in\nthe bud by some very effectual remedy. Then she recounts a surprising\ncure performed by a certain apothecary, and appeals to the testimony of\nthe waiting-woman, who being the gossip of his wife, confirms the\nevidence, and corroborates the proposal. The apothecary being summoned,\nfinds her ladyship in such a delicate situation, that he declines\nprescribing, and advises her to send for a physician without delay. The\nnomination of course falls to him, and the doctor being called,\ndeclares the necessity of immediate venesection, which is accordingly\nperformed by a surgeon of the association.This is one way of beginning the game. Though the commencement often\nvaries, and sometimes the apothecary and sometimes the physician opens\nthe scene; but, be that as it will, they always appear in a string,\nlike a flight of wild geese, and each confederacy maintains a\ncorrespondence with one particular undertaker. Fathom, upon these\nconsiderations, set up his rest in the first floor of an apothecary in\nthe neighbourhood of Charing Cross, to whom he was introduced by a\nletter from a friend at Tunbridge, and who being made acquainted with\nhis ability and scheme, promised to let slip no opportunity of serving\nhim; and, indeed, seemed to espouse his interest with great alacrity.\nHe introduced him to some of his patients, on the strength of a gratis\nvisit, sounded forth his praise among all the good women of his\nacquaintance; and even prevailed upon him to publish advertisements,\nimporting that he would every day, at a certain time and place, give\nhis advice to the poor for nothing; hoping that, by means of some lucky\ncure, his fame might be extended, and his practice grow into request."

For the method of driving up\none street and down another, without halting, was become such a stale\nexpedient, that the very ’prentices used to stand at the shop doors,\nand ridicule the vain parade. At length, however, he perused the map of\nLondon with great diligence, and, having acquired a distinct idea of\nits topography, used to alight at the end of long narrow thoroughfares\nand paved courts, where the chariot was ordered to wait till his\nreturn; and, walking with great gravity through the different turnings\nof these alleys, regain his carriage by another passage, and resume his\nseat with an air of vast importance. With a view to protract the time\nof his supposed visits, he would, at one place, turn aside to a wall;\nat another, cheapen an urinal; at a third corner, read a quack\nadvertisement, or lounge a few minutes in some bookseller’s shop; and,\nlastly, glide into some obscure coffee-house, and treat himself with a\ndram of usquebaugh.The other means used to force a trade, such as ordering himself to be\ncalled from church, alarming the neighbourhood with knocking at his\ndoor in the night, receiving sudden messages in places of resort, and\ninserting his cures by way of news in the daily papers, had been so\ninjudiciously hackneyed by every desperate sculler in physic, that they\nhad lost their effect upon the public, and therefore were excluded from\nthe plan of our adventurer, whose scheme, for the present, was to exert\nhimself in winning the favour of those sage Sibyls, who keep, as it\nwere, the temple of medicine, and admit the young priest to the service\nof the altar; but this he considered as a temporary project only, until\nhe should have acquired interest enough to erect an hospital, lock, or\ninfirmary, by the voluntary subscription of his friends, a scheme which\nhad succeeded to a miracle with many of the profession, who had raised\nthemselves into notice upon the carcases of the poor.Yet even this branch was already overstocked, insomuch that almost\nevery street was furnished with one of these charitable receptacles,\nwhich, instead of diminishing the taxes for the maintenance of the\npoor, encouraged the vulgar to be idle and dissolute, by opening an\nasylum to them and their families, from the diseases of poverty and\nintemperance. For it remains to be proved, that the parish rates are\ndecreased, the bills of mortality lessened, the people more numerous,\nor the streets less infested with beggars, notwithstanding the immense\nsums yearly granted by individuals for the relief of the indigent."

So\nthat our hero got little else than experience and trouble, excepting a\nfew guineas which he made shift to glean among sojourners, with whom he\nbecame occasionally acquainted, or young people, who had been\nunfortunate in their amours.In the midst of these endeavours, he did not omit his duty to the old\ngentlewoman, whose daughter he had cured at Tunbridge; and was always\nreceived with particular complacency, which, perhaps, he, in some\nmeasure, owed to his genteel equipage, that gave credit to every door\nbefore which it was seen; yet, Miss Biddy was as inaccessible as ever,\nwhile the mother became more and more warm in her civilities, till at\nlength, after having prepared him with some extraordinary compliments,\nshe gave him to understand, that Biddy was no better than a\ngiddy-headed girl, far from being unexceptionable in her moral\ncharacter, and particularly deficient in duty and gratitude to her, who\nhad been always a tender and indulgent parent; she was therefore\ndetermined to punish the young minx for her levity and want of natural\naffection, by altering her own condition, could she find a worthy and\nagreeable man, on whom she could bestow her hand and fortune without a\nblush."

Though this answer was\npronounced in such a manner as gave her to understand he had taken the\nhint, she would not cheapen her condescension so much as to explain\nherself further at that juncture, and he was very well contented to woo\nher on her own terms; accordingly he began to season his behaviour with\na spice of gallantry, when he had opportunities of being particular\nwith this new inamorata, and, in proportion to the returns she made, he\ngradually detached himself from Miss Biddy, by intermitting, and, at\nlast, discontinuing those ardent expressions of love and admiration,\nwhich he had made shift to convey in private looks and stolen whispers,\nduring the rancorous inspection of her mother.Such alteration could not long escape the jealous eyes of the young\nlady, no more than the cause of this alienation, which, in a moment,\nconverted all her love into irreconcilable hate, and filled her whole\nsoul with the most eager desire of vengeance. For she now not only\nconsidered him as a mercenary wretch, who had slighted her attractions\nfor the sordid gratifications of avarice, but also as an interloper,\nwho wanted to intercept her fortune, in the odious character of a\nfather-in-law. But, before she could bring her aim to any ripeness of\ncontrivance, her mother, having caught cold at church, was seized with\na rheumatic fever, became delirious in less than three days, and,\nnotwithstanding all the prescriptions and care of her admirer, gave up\nthe ghost, without having retrieved the use of her senses, or been able\nto manifest, by will, the sentiments she entertained in favour of her\nphysician, who, as the reader will easily perceive, had more reasons\nthan one to be mortally chagrined at this event.Miss Biddy being thus put in possession of the whole inheritance, not\nonly renounced all correspondence with Doctor Fathom, by forbidding him\nthe house, but likewise took all opportunities of prejudicing his\ncharacter, by hinting, that her dear mamma had fallen a sacrifice to\nhis ignorance and presumption.CHAPTER FIFTY-THREEACQUIRES EMPLOYMENT IN CONSEQUENCE OF A LUCKY MISCARRIAGE."

For, in consequence of her invectives, he was, in a\nfew days, called to the wife of a merchant, who piously hoped, that his\npractice would not give Miss Biddy the lie. The patient had long\nlingered under a complication of distempers, and being in no immediate\ndanger of her life, Doctor Fathom was in no hurry to strike a decisive\nstroke; till the husband growing impatient of delay, and so explicit in\nhis hints, that it was impossible to misapprehend his meaning, our\nadventurer resolved to do something effectual for his satisfaction, and\nprescribed a medicine of such rough operation, as he thought must\neither oblige his employer, or produce a change in the lady’s\nconstitution, that would make a noise in the world, and bring a new\naccession to his fame.Proceeding upon these maxims, he could not be disappointed. The remedy\nplayed its part with such violence, as reduced the patient to\nextremity, and the merchant had actually bespoke an undertaker; when,\nafter a series of swoonings and convulsions, nature so far prevailed,\nas to expel, at once, the prescription and the disease; yet the\ngood-natured husband was so much affected with the agonies to which he\nsaw the wife of his bosom exposed by this specific, that, although the\neffect of it was her perfect recovery, he could never bear the sight of\nFathom for the future, nor even hear his name mentioned, without giving\nsigns of horror and indignation. Nay, he did not scruple to affirm,\nthat, had our adventurer been endowed with the least tincture of\nhumanity, he would have suffered the poor woman to depart in peace,\nrather than restore her to health, at the expense of such anxiety and\ntorture."

When a physician becomes the town talk, he generally\nconcludes his business more than half done, even though his fame should\nwholly turn upon his malpractice; insomuch that some members of the\nfaculty have been heard to complain, that they never had the good\nfortune to be publicly accused of homicide; and it is well known, that\na certain famous empiric, of our day, never flourished to any degree of\nwealth and reputation till after he had been attacked in print, and\nfairly convicted of having destroyed a good number of the human\nspecies. Success raised upon such a foundation would, by a disciple of\nPlato, and some modern moralists, be ascribed to the innate virtue and\ngenerosity of the human heart, which naturally espouses the cause that\nneeds protection. But I, whose notions of human excellence are not\nquite so sublime, am apt to believe it is owing to that spirit of\nself-conceit and contradiction, which is, at least, as universal, if\nnot as natural, as the moral sense so warmly contended for by those\nideal philosophers.The most infamous wretch often finds his account in these principles of\nmalevolence and self-love. For wheresoever his character falls under\ndiscussion there is generally some person present, who, either from an\naffectation of singularity, or envy to the accusers, undertakes his\ndefence, and endeavours to invalidate the articles of his impeachment,\nuntil he is heated by altercation, and hurried into more effectual\nmeasures for his advantage. If such benefits accrue to those who have\nno real merit to depend upon, surely our hero could not but reap\nsomething extraordinary from the debates to which he now gave rise; as,\nby the miraculous cure he had affected, all his patient’s friends, all\nthe enemies of her husband, all those who envied his other adversary,\nwere interested in his behalf, exclusive of such admirers as surprise\nand curiosity might engage in his cause."

The newspapers teemed with\nhis praise; and in order to keep up the attention of the public, his\nemissaries, male and female, separated into different coffee-houses,\ncompanies, and clubs, where they did not fail to comment upon these\narticles of intelligence. Such a favourable incident is, of itself,\nsufficient to float the bark of a man’s fortune. He was, in a few days,\ncalled to another lady, labouring under the same disorder he had so\nsuccessfully dispelled, and she thought herself benefited by his\nadvice. His acquaintance naturally extended itself among the visitants\nand allies of his patients; he was recommended from family to family;\nthe fees began to multiply; a variety of footmen appeared every day at\nhis door; he discontinued his sham circuit, and looking upon the\npresent conjuncture, as that tide in his affairs, which, according to\nShakespeare, when taken at the full, leads on to fortune, he resolved\nthat the opportunity should not be lost, and applied himself with such\nassiduity to his practice, that, in all likelihood, he would have\ncarried the palm from all his contemporaries, had he not split upon the\nsame rock which had shipwrecked his hopes before.We have formerly descanted upon that venereal appetite which glowed in\nthe constitution of our adventurer, and with all his philosophy and\ncaution could hardly keep within bounds. The reader, therefore, will\nnot be much surprised to learn, that, in the exercise of his\nprofession, he contracted an intimacy with a clergyman’s wife, whom he\nattended as a physician, and whose conjugal virtue he subdued by a long\nand diligent exertion of his delusive arts, while her mind was\nenervated by sickness, and her husband abroad upon his necessary\noccasions. This unhappy patient, who was a woman of an agreeable person\nand lively conversation, fell a sacrifice to her own security and\nself-conceit; her want of health had confined her to a sedentary life,\nand her imagination being active and restless, she had spent those\nhours in reading which other young women devote to company and\ndiversion, but, as her studies were not superintended by any person of\ntaste, she had indulged her own fancy without method or propriety. The\nSpectator taught her to be a critic and philosopher; from plays she\nlearned poetry and wit, and derived her knowledge of life from books of\nhistory and adventures. Fraught with these acquisitions, and furnished\nby nature with uncommon vivacity, she despised her own sex, and courted\nthe society of men, among whom she thought her talents might be more\nhonourably displayed, fully confident of her own virtue and sagacity,\nwhich enabled her to set all their arts at defiance."

You stand amazed at this preamble,\nbut alas! how will you be shocked when I own that I have betrayed you\nin your absence, that I have trespassed against God and my marriage\nvow, and fallen from the pride and confidence of virtue to the most\nabject state of vice; yes, I have been unfaithful to your bed, having\nfallen a victim to the infernal insinuations of a villain, who took\nadvantage of my weak and unguarded moments.

By these means the doctor’s name became so\nnotorious that every man was afraid of admitting him into his house,\nand every woman ashamed of soliciting his advice.CHAPTER FIFTY-FOURHIS ECLIPSE, AND GRADUAL DECLINATION.Misfortunes seldom come single; upon the back of this hue and cry he\nunluckily prescribed phlebotomy to a gentleman of some rank, who\nchanced to expire during the operation, and quarrelled with his\nlandlord the apothecary, who charged him with having forgot the good\noffices he had done him in the beginning of his career, and desired he\nwould provide himself with another lodging.All these mishaps, treading upon the heels of one another, had a very\nmortifying effect upon his practice. At every tea-table his name was\noccasionally put to the torture, with that of the vile creature whom he\nhad seduced, though it was generally taken for granted by all those\nfemale casuists, that she must have made the first advances, for it\ncould not be supposed that any man would take much trouble in laying\nschemes for the ruin of a person whose attractions were so slender,\nespecially considering the ill state of her health, a circumstance that\nseldom adds to a woman’s beauty or good-humour; besides, she was always\na pert minx, that affected singularity, and a masculine manner of\nspeaking, and many of them had foreseen that she would, some time or\nother, bring herself into such a premunire.

Both these funds, however, failed\nin a very little time, his lawsuit was a gulf that swallowed up all his\nready money, and the gleanings of his practice were scarce sufficient\nto answer his pocket expenses, which now increased in proportion to the\ndecrease of business, for, as he had more idle time, and was less\nadmitted into private families, so he thought he had more occasion to\nenlarge his acquaintance among his own sex, who alone were able to\nsupport him in his disgrace with the other. He accordingly listed\nhimself in several clubs, and endeavoured to monopolise the venereal\nbranch of trade, though this was but an indifferent resource, for\nalmost all his patients of this class were such as either could not, or\nwould not, properly recompense the physician.For some time he lingered in this situation, without going upwards or\ndownwards, floating like a wisp of straw at the turning of the tide,\nuntil he could no longer amuse the person of whom he had hired his\ncoach-horses, or postpone the other demands, which multiplied upon him\nevery day. Then was his chariot overturned with a hideous crash, and\nhis face so much wounded with the shivers of the glass, which went to\npieces in the fall, that he appeared in the coffee-house with half a\ndozen black patches upon his countenance, gave a most circumstantial\ndetail of the risk he had run, and declared, that he did not believe he\nshould ever hazard himself again in any sort of wheel carriage."

  "content": "Soon after this accident, he took an opportunity of telling his\nfriends, in the same public place, that he had turned away his footman\non account of his drunkenness, and was resolved, for the future, to\nkeep none but maids in his service, because the menservants are\ngenerally impudent, lazy, debauched, or dishonest; and after all,\nneither so neat, handy, or agreeable as the other sex. In the rear of\nthis resolution, he shifted his lodgings into a private court, being\ndistracted with the din of carriages, that disturb the inhabitants who\nlive towards the open street; and gave his acquaintance to understand,\nthat he had a medical work upon the anvil, which he could not finish\nwithout being indulged in silence and tranquillity. In effect, he\ngradually put on the exteriors of an author. His watch, with an\nhorizontal movement by Graham, which he had often mentioned, and shown\nas a very curious piece of workmanship, began, about this time, to be\nvery much out of order, and was committed to the care of a mender, who\nwas in no hurry to restore it. His tie-wig degenerated into a major; he\nsometimes appeared without a sword, and was even observed in public\nwith a second day’s shirt. At last, his clothes became rusty; and when\nhe walked about the streets, his head turned round in a surprising\nmanner, by an involuntary motion in his neck, which he had contracted\nby a habit of reconnoitring the ground, that he might avoid all\ndangerous or disagreeable encounters.Fathom, finding himself descending the hill of fortune with an acquired\ngravitation, strove to catch at every twig, in order to stop or retard\nhis descent. He now regretted the opportunities he had neglected, of\nmarrying one of several women of moderate fortune, who had made\nadvances to him in the zenith of his reputation; and endeavoured, by\nforcing himself into a lower path of life than any he had hitherto\ntrod, to keep himself afloat, with the portion of some tradesman’s\ndaughter, whom he meant to espouse. While he exerted himself in this\npursuit, he happened, in returning from a place about thirty miles from\nLondon, to become acquainted, in the stage-coach, with a young woman of\na very homely appearance, whom, from the driver’s information, he\nunderstood to be the niece of a country justice, and daughter of a\nsoap-boiler, who had lived and died in London, and left her, in her\ninfancy, sole heiress of his effects, which amounted to four thousand\npounds. The uncle, who was her guardian, had kept her sacred from the\nknowledge of the world, resolving to effect a match betwixt her and his\nown son; and it was with much difficulty he had consented to this\njourney, which she had undertaken as a visit to her own mother, who had\nmarried a second husband in town."

  "content": "Fraught with these anecdotes, Fathom began to put forth his gallantry\nand good-humour, and, in a word, was admitted by the lady to the\nprivilege of an acquaintance, in which capacity he visited her during\nthe term of her residence in London; and, as there was no time to be\nlost, declared his honourable intentions. He had such a manifest\nadvantage, in point of personal accomplishments, over the young\ngentleman who was destined for her husband, that she did not disdain\nhis proposals; and, before she set out for the country, he had made\nsuch progress in her heart, that the day was actually fixed for their\nnuptials, on which he faithfully promised to carry her off in a coach\nand six. How to raise money for this expedition was all the difficulty\nthat remained; for, by this time, his finances were utterly dried up,\nand his credit altogether exhausted. Upon a very pressing occasion, he\nhad formerly applied himself to a certain wealthy quack, who had\nrelieved his necessities by lending him a small sum of money, in return\nfor having communicated to him a secret medicine, which he affirmed to\nbe the most admirable specific that ever was invented. The nostrum had\nbeen used, and, luckily for him, succeeded in the trial; so that the\nempiric, in the midst of his satisfaction, began to reflect, that this\nsame Fathom, who pretended to be in possession of a great many\nremedies, equally efficacious, would certainly become a formidable\nrival to him in his business, should he ever be able to extricate\nhimself from his present difficulties.In consequence of these suggestions, he resolved to keep our\nadventurer’s head under water, by maintaining him in the most abject\ndependence. Accordingly he had, from time to time, accommodated him\nwith small trifles, which barely served to support his existence, and\neven for these had taken notes of hand, that he might have a scourge\nover his head, in case he should prove insolent or refractory. To this\nbenefactor Fathom applied for a reinforcement of twenty guineas, which\nhe solicited with the more confidence, as that sum would certainly\nenable him to repay all other obligations. The quack would advance the\nmoney upon no other condition, than that of knowing the scheme, which\nbeing explained, he complied with Ferdinand’s request; but, at the same\ntime, privately despatched an express to the young lady’s uncle, with a\nfull account of the whole conspiracy; so that, when the doctor arrived\nat the inn, according to appointment, he was received by his worship in\nperson, who gave him to understand, that his niece had changed her\nmind, and gone fifty miles farther into the country to visit a\nrelation. This was a grievous disappointment to Fathom, who really\nbelieved his mistress had forsaken him through mere levity and caprice,\nand was not undeceived till several months after her marriage with her\ncousin, when, at an accidental meeting in London, she explained the\nstory of the secret intelligence, and excused her marriage, as the\neffect of rigorous usage and compulsion."

  "content": "Had our hero been really enamoured of her person, he might have\nprobably accomplished his wishes, notwithstanding the steps she had\ntaken. But this was not the case. His passion was of a different\nnature, and the object of it effectually without his reach. With regard\nto his appetite for women, as it was an infirmity of his constitution,\nwhich he could not overcome, and as he was in no condition to gratify\nit at a great expense, he had of late chosen a housekeeper from the\nhundreds of Drury, and, to avoid scandal, allowed her to assume his\nname. As to the intimation which had been sent to the country justice,\nhe immediately imputed it to the true author, whom he marked for his\nvengeance accordingly; but, in the meantime, suppressed his resentment,\nbecause he in some measure depended upon him for subsistence. On the\nother hand, the quack, dreading the forwardness and plausibility of our\nhero, which might, one time or other, render him independent, put a\nstop to those supplies, on pretence of finding them inconvenient; but,\nout of his friendship and goodwill to Fathom, undertook to procure for\nhim such letters of recommendation as would infallibly make his fortune\nin the West Indies, and even to set him out in a genteel manner for the\nvoyage. Ferdinand perceived his drift, and thanked him for his generous\noffer, which he would not fail to consider with all due deliberation;\nthough he was determined against the proposal, but obliged to\ntemporise, that he might not incur the displeasure of this man, at\nwhose mercy he lay. Meanwhile the prosecution against him in Doctors’\nCommons drew near a period, and the lawyers were clamorous for money,\nwithout which, he foresaw he should lose the advantage which his cause\nhad lately acquired by the death of his antagonist’s chief evidence; he\ntherefore, seeing every other channel shut up, began to doubt, whether\nthe risk of being apprehended or slain in the character of a\nhighwayman, was not overbalanced by the prospect of being acquitted of\na charge which had ruined his reputation and fortune, and actually\nentertained thoughts of taking the air on Hounslow Heath, when he was\ndiverted from this expedient by a very singular adventure."

  "content": "CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVEAFTER DIVERS UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS, HE HAS RECOURSE TO THE MATRIMONIAL\nNOOSE.Chancing to meet with one of his acquaintance at a certain\ncoffee-house, the discourse turned upon the characters of mankind,\nwhen, among other oddities, his friend brought upon the carpet a\ncertain old gentlewoman of such a rapacious disposition, that, like a\njackdaw, she never beheld any metalline substance, without an\ninclination, and even an effort to secrete it for her own use and\ncontemplation. Nor was this infirmity originally produced from\nindigence, inasmuch as her circumstances had been always affluent, and\nshe was now possessed of a considerable sum of money in the funds;\nnotwithstanding which, the avarice of her nature tempted her to let\nlodgings, though few people could live under the same roof with such an\noriginal, who, rather than be idle, had often filched pieces of her own\nplate, and charged her servants with the theft, or hinted suspicion of\nher lodgers. Fathom, struck with the description, soon perceived how\nthis woman’s disease might be converted to his advantage; and after\nhaving obtained sufficient intelligence, on pretence of satisfying his\ncuriosity, he visited the widow, in consequence of a bill at her door,\nand actually hired an apartment in her house, whither he forthwith\nrepaired with his inamorata."

  "content": "It was not long before he perceived that his landlady’s character had\nnot been misrepresented. He fed her distemper with divers\ninconsiderable trinkets, such as copper medals, corkscrews, odd\nbuckles, and a paltry seal set in silver, which were, at different\ntimes, laid as baits for her infirmity, and always conveyed away with\nremarkable eagerness, which he and his Dulcinea took pleasure in\nobserving from an unsuspected place. Thus confirmed in his opinion, he,\nat length, took an opportunity of exposing a metal watch that belonged\nto his mistress, and saw it seized with great satisfaction, in the\nabsence of his helpmate, who had gone abroad on purpose. According to\ninstruction, she soon returned, and began to raise a terrible clamour\nabout the loss of her watch; upon which she was condoled by her\nlandlady, who seemed to doubt the integrity of the maid, and even\nproposed that Mrs. Fathom should apply to some justice of the peace for\na warrant to search the servant’s trunk. The lady thanked her for the\ngood advice, in compliance with which she had immediate recourse to a\nmagistrate, who granted a search warrant, not against the maid, but the\nmistress; and she, in a little time, returned with the constable at her\nback.These precautions being taken, Doctor Fathom desired a private\nconference with the old gentlewoman, in which he gave her to\nunderstand, that he had undoubted proofs of her having secreted, not\nonly the watch, but also several other odd things of less consequence,\nwhich he lost since his residence in her house. He then showed the\nwarrant he had obtained against her, and asked if she had anything to\noffer why the constable should not do his duty? Inexpressible were the\nanguish and confusion of the defendant, when she found herself thus\nentrapped, and reflected, that she was on the point of being detected\nof felony; for she at once concluded, that the snare was laid for her,\nand knew that the officer of justice would certainly find the unlucky\nwatch in one of the drawers of her scrutoire.Tortured with these suggestions, afraid of public disgrace, and\ndreading the consequence of legal conviction, she fell on her knees\nbefore the injured Fathom, and, after having imputed her crime to the\ntemptations of necessity, implored his compassion, promised to restore\nthe watch, and everything she had taken, and begged he would dismiss\nthe constable, that her reputation might not suffer in the eye of the\nworld."

  "content": "Ferdinand, with a severity of countenance purposely assumed, observed\nthat, were she really indigent, he had charity enough to forgive what\nshe had done; but, as he knew her circumstances were opulent, he looked\nupon this excuse as an aggravation of her guilt, which was certainly\nthe effect of a vicious inclination; and he was therefore determined to\nprosecute her with the utmost severity of the law, as an example and\nterror to others, who might be infected with the same evil disposition.\nFinding him deaf to all her tears and entreaties, she changed her note,\nand offered him one hundred guineas, if he would compromise the affair,\nand drop the prosecution, so as that her character should sustain no\ndamage. After much argumentation, he consented to accept of double the\nsum, which being instantly paid in East India bonds, Doctor Fathom told\nthe constable, that the watch was found; and for once her reputation\nwas patched up. This seasonable supply enabled our hero to stand trial\nwith his adversary, who was nonsuited, and also to mend his external\nappearance, which of late had not been extremely magnificent.Soon after this gleam of good fortune, a tradesman, to whom he was\nconsiderably indebted, seeing no other probable means to recover his\nmoney, introduced Fathom to the acquaintance of a young widow who\nlodged at his house, and was said to be in possession of a considerable\nfortune. Considering the steps that were taken, it would have been\nalmost impossible for him to miscarry in his addresses. The lady had\nbeen bred in the country, was unacquainted with the world, and of a\nvery sanguine disposition, which her short trial of matrimony had not\nserved to cool. Our adventurer was instructed to call at the\ntradesman’s house, as if by accident, at an appointed time, when the\nwidow was drinking tea with her landlady. On these occasions he always\nbehaved to admiration. She liked his person, and praised his\npoliteness, good-humour, and good sense; his confederates extolled him\nas a prodigy of learning, taste, and good-nature; they likewise\nrepresented him as a person on the eve of eclipsing all his competitors\nin physic. An acquaintance and intimacy soon ensued, nor was he\nrestricted in point of opportunity. In a word, he succeeded in his\nendeavours, and, one evening, on pretence of attending her to the play,\nhe accompanied her to the Fleet, where they were married, in presence\nof the tradesman and his wife, who were of the party."
