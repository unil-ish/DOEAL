  "content": "This profound director did not fail, in honour of his own discernment,\nto whisper about the misrepresentation, as an instance of the young\nCount’s insolence, and Fathom’s humility and good sense. The story was\ncirculated among the servants, especially the maids belonging to the\nfamily, whose favour our hero had acquired by his engaging behaviour;\nand at length it reached the ears of his patron, who, incensed at his\nson’s presumption and inhospitality, called him to a severe account,\nwhen the young gentleman absolutely denied the truth of the allegation,\nand appealed to the evidence of Fathom himself. Our adventurer was\naccordingly summoned by the father, and encouraged to declare the\ntruth, with an assurance of his constant protection; upon which\nFerdinand very wisely fell upon his knees, and, while the tears gushed\nfrom his eyes, acquitted the young Count of the imputation, and\nexpressed his apprehension, that the report had been spread by some of\nhis enemies, who wanted to prejudice him in the opinion of his patron.The old gentleman was not satisfied of his son’s integrity by this\ndeclaration; being naturally of a generous disposition, highly\nprepossessed in favour of the poor orphan, and chagrined at the\nunpromising appearance of his heir, he suspected that Fathom was\noverawed by the fear of giving offence, and that, notwithstanding what\nhe had said, the case really stood as it had been represented. In this\npersuasion, he earnestly exhorted his son to resist and combat with any\nimpulse he might feel within himself, tending to selfishness, fraud, or\nimposition; to encourage every sentiment of candour and benevolence,\nand to behave with moderation and affability to all his\nfellow-creatures. He laid upon him strong injunctions, not without a\nmixture of threats, to consider Fathom as the object of his peculiar\nregard; to respect him as the son of the Count’s preserver, as a\nBriton, a stranger, and, above all, an helpless orphan, to whom the\nrights of hospitality were doubly due."

  "content": "Such admonitions were not lost upon the youth, who, under the rough\nhusk of his personal exhibition, possessed a large share of generous\nsensibility. Without any formal professions to his father, he resolved\nto govern himself according to his remonstrances; and, far from\nconceiving the least spark of animosity against Fathom, he looked upon\nthe poor boy as the innocent cause of his disgrace, and redoubled his\nkindness towards him, that his honour might never again be called in\nquestion, upon the same subject. Nothing is more liable to\nmisconstruction than an act of uncommon generosity; one half of the\nworld mistake the motive, from want of ideas to conceive an instance of\nbeneficence that soars so high above the level of their own sentiments;\nand the rest suspect it of something sinister or selfish, from the\nsuggestions of their own sordid and vicious inclinations. The young\nCount subjected himself to such misinterpretation, among those who\nobserved the increased warmth of civility and complaisance in his\nbehaviour to Ferdinand. They ascribed it to his desire of still\nprofiting by our adventurer’s superior talents, by which alone they\nsupposed him enabled to maintain any degree of reputation at school; or\nto the fear of being convicted by him of some misdemeanour of which he\nknew himself guilty. These suspicions were not effaced by the conduct\nof Ferdinand, who, when examined on the subject, managed his answers in\nsuch a manner, as confirmed their conjectures, while he pretended to\nrefute them, and at the same time acquired to himself credit for his\nextraordinary discretion and self-denial.If he exhibited such a proof of sagacity in the twelfth year of his\nage, what might not be expected from his finesse in the maturity of his\nfaculties and experience? Thus secured in the good graces of the whole\nfamily, he saw the days of his puerility glide along in the most\nagreeable elapse of caresses and amusement. He never fairly plunged\ninto the stream of school-education, but, by floating on the surface,\nimbibed a small tincture of those different sciences which his master\npretended to teach. In short, he resembled those vagrant swallows that\nskim along the level of some pool or river, without venturing to wet\none feather in their wings, except in the accidental pursuit of an\ninconsiderable fly. Yet, though his capacity or inclination was\nunsuited for studies of this kind, he did not fail to manifest a\nperfect genius in the acquisition of other more profitable arts. Over\nand above the accomplishments of address, for which he hath been\nalready celebrated, he excelled all his fellows in his dexterity at\nfives and billiards; was altogether unrivalled in his skill at draughts\nand backgammon; began, even at these years, to understand the moves and\nschemes of chess; and made himself a mere adept in the mystery of\ncards, which he learned in the course of his assiduities and attention\nto the females of the house.CHAPTER SIXHE MEDITATES SCHEMES OF IMPORTANCE.It was in these parties that he attracted the notice and friendship of\nhis patron’s daughter, a girl by two years older than himself, who was\nnot insensible to his qualifications, and looked upon him with the most\nfavourable eyes of prepossession. Whether or not he at this period of\nhis life began to project plans for availing himself of her\nsusceptibility, is uncertain; but, without all doubt, he cultivated her\nesteem with as obsequious and submissive attention as if he had already\nformed the design, which, in his advanced age, he attempted to put in\nexecution."

  "content": "Divers circumstances conspired to promote him in the favour of this\nyoung lady; the greenness of his years secured him from any appearance\nof fallacious aim; so that he was indulged in frequent opportunities of\nconversing with his young mistress, whose parents encouraged this\ncommunication, by which they hoped she would improve in speaking the\nlanguage of her father. Such connexions naturally produce intimacy and\nfriendship. Fathom’s person was agreeable, his talents calculated for\nthe meridian of those parties, and his manners so engaging, that there\nwould have been no just subject for wonder, had he made an impression\nupon the tender unexperienced heart of Mademoiselle de Melvil, whose\nbeauty was not so attractive as to extinguish his hope, in raising up a\nnumber of formidable rivals; though her expectations of fortune were\nsuch as commonly lend additional lustre to personal merit.All these considerations were so many steps towards the success of\nFerdinand’s pretensions; and though he cannot be supposed to have\nperceived them at first, he in the sequel seemed perfectly well\napprised of his advantages, and used them to the full extent of his\nfaculties. Observing that she delighted in music, he betook himself to\nthe study of that art, and, by dint of application and a tolerable ear,\nlearned of himself to accompany her with a German flute, while she sung\nand played upon the harpsichord. The Count, seeing his inclination, and\nthe progress he had made, resolved that his capacity should not be lost\nfor want of cultivation; and accordingly provided him with a master, by\nwhom he was instructed in the principles of the art, and soon became a\nproficient in playing upon the violin."

  "content": "In the practice of these improvements and avocations, and in attendance\nupon his young master, whom he took care never to disoblige or neglect,\nhe attained to the age of sixteen, without feeling the least abatement\nin the friendship and generosity of those upon whom he depended; but,\non the contrary, receiving every day fresh marks of their bounty and\nregard. He had before this time been smit with the ambition of making a\nconquest of the young lady’s heart, and foresaw manifold advantages to\nhimself in becoming son-in-law to Count Melvil, who, he never doubted,\nwould soon be reconciled to the match, if once it could be effectuated\nwithout his knowledge. Although he thought he had great reason to\nbelieve that Mademoiselle looked upon him with an eye of peculiar\nfavour, his disposition was happily tempered with an ingredient of\ncaution, that hindered him from acting with precipitation; and he had\ndiscerned in the young lady’s deportment certain indications of\nloftiness and pride, which kept him in the utmost vigilance and\ncircumspection; for he knew, that, by a premature declaration, he\nshould run the risk of forfeiting all the advantages he had gained, and\nblasting those expectations that now blossomed so gaily in his heart.Restricted by these reflections, he acted at a wary distance, and\ndetermined to proceed by the method of sap, and, summoning all his\nartifice and attractions to his aid, employed them under the insidious\ncover of profound respect, in order to undermine those bulwarks of\nhaughtiness or discretion, which otherwise might have rendered his\napproaches to her impracticable. With a view to enhance the value of\nhis company, and sound her sentiments at the same time, he became more\nreserved than usual, and seldomer engaged in her parties of music and\ncards; yet, in the midst of his reserve, he never failed in those\ndemonstrations of reverence and regard, which he knew perfectly well\nhow to express, but devised such excuses for his absence, as she could\nnot help admitting. In consequence of this affected shyness, she more\nthan once gently chid him for his neglect and indifference, observing,\nwith an ironical air, that he was now too much of a man to be\nentertained with such effeminate diversions; but her reproofs were\npronounced with too much ease and good-humour to be agreeable to our\nhero, who desired to see her ruffled and chagrined at his absence, and\nto hear himself rebuked with an angry affectation of disdain. This\neffort, therefore, he reinforced with the most captivating carriage he\ncould assume, in those hours which he now so sparingly bestowed upon\nhis mistress. He regaled her with all the entertaining stories he could\nlearn or invent, particularly such as he thought would justify and\nrecommend the levelling power of love, that knows no distinctions of\nfortune. He sung nothing but tender airs and passionate complaints,\ncomposed by desponding or despairing swains; and, to render his\nperformances of this kind the more pathetic, interlarded them with some\nseasonable sighs, while the tears, which he had ever at command, stood\ncollected in either eye."

  "content": "It was impossible for her to overlook such studied emotions; she in a\njocose manner taxed him with having lost his heart, rallied the excess\nof his passion, and in a merry strain undertook to be an advocate for\nhis love. Her behaviour was still wide of his wish and expectation. He\nthought she would, in consequence of her discovery, have betrayed some\ninterested symptom; that her face would have undergone some favourable\nsuffusion; that her tongue would have faltered, her breast heaved, and\nher whole deportment betokened internal agitation and disorder, in\nwhich case, he meant to profit by the happy impression, and declare\nhimself, before she could possibly recollect the dictates of her\npride.—Baffled however in his endeavours, by the serenity of the young\nlady, which he still deemed equivocal, he had recourse to another\nexperiment, by which he believed he should make a discovery of her\nsentiments beyond all possibility of doubt. One day, while he\naccompanied Mademoiselle in her exercise of music, he pretended all of\na sudden to be taken ill, and counterfeited a swoon in her apartment.\nSurprised at this accident, she screamed aloud, but far from running to\nhis assistance, with the transports and distraction of a lover, she\nordered her maid, who was present, to support his head, and went in\nperson to call for more help. He was accordingly removed to his own\nchamber, where, willing to be still more certified of her inclinations,\nhe prolonged the farce, and lay groaning under the pretence of a severe\nfever.The whole family was alarmed upon this occasion; for, as we have\nalready observed, he was an universal favourite. He was immediately\nvisited by the old Count and his lady, who expressed the utmost concern\nat his distemper, ordered him to be carefully attended, and sent for a\nphysician without loss of time. The young gentleman would scarce stir\nfrom his bedside, where he ministered unto him with all the\ndemonstrations of brotherly affection; and Miss exhorted him to keep up\nhis spirits, with many expressions of unreserved sympathy and regard.\nNevertheless, he saw nothing in her behaviour but what might be\nnaturally expected from common friendship, and a compassionate\ndisposition, and was very much mortified at his disappointment."

  "content": "Whether the miscarriage actually affected his constitution, or the\ndoctor happened to be mistaken in his diagnostics, we shall not pretend\nto determine; but the patient was certainly treated secundum artem, and\nall his complaints in a little time realised; for the physician, like a\ntrue graduate, had an eye to the apothecary in his prescriptions; and\nsuch was the concern and scrupulous care with which our hero was\nattended, that the orders of the faculty were performed with the utmost\npunctuality. He was blooded, vomited, purged, and blistered, in the\nusual forms (for the physicians of Hungary are generally as well\nskilled in the arts of their occupation as any other leeches under the\nsun), and swallowed a whole dispensary of bolusses, draughts, and\napozems, by which means he became fairly delirious in three days, and\nso untractable, that he could be no longer managed according to rule;\notherwise, in all likelihood, the world would never have enjoyed the\nbenefit of these adventures. In short, his constitution, though unable\nto cope with two such formidable antagonists as the doctor and the\ndisease he had conjured up, was no sooner rid of the one, than it\neasily got the better of the other; and though Ferdinand, after all,\nfound his grand aim unaccomplished, his malady was productive of a\nconsequence, which, though he had not foreseen it, he did not fail to\nconvert to his own use and advantage.CHAPTER SEVENENGAGES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A FEMALE ASSOCIATE, IN ORDER TO PUT HIS\nTALENTS IN ACTION.While he displayed his qualifications in order to entrap the heart of\nhis young mistress, he had unwittingly enslaved the affections of her\nmaid. This attendant was also a favourite of the young lady, and,\nthough her senior by two or three good years at least, unquestionably\nher superior in point of personal beauty; she moreover possessed a good\nstock of cunning and discernment, and was furnished by nature with a\nvery amorous complexion. These circumstances being premised, the reader\nwill not be surprised to find her smitten by those uncommon\nqualifications which we have celebrated in young Fathom. She had in\ngood sooth long sighed in secret, under the powerful influence of his\ncharms, and practised upon him all those little arts, by which a woman\nstrives to attract the admiration, and ensnare the heart of a man she\nloves; but all his faculties were employed upon the plan which he had\nalready projected; that was the goal of his whole attention, to which\nall his measures tended; and whether or not he perceived the impression\nhe had made upon Teresa, he never gave her the least reason to believe\nhe was conscious of his victory, until he found himself baffled in his\ndesign upon the heart of her mistress.—She therefore persevered in her\ndistant attempts to allure him, with the usual coquetries of dress and\naddress, and, in the sweet hope of profiting by his susceptibility,\nmade shift to suppress her feelings, and keep her passion within\nbounds, until his supposed danger alarmed her fears, and raised such a\ntumult within her breast, that she could no longer conceal her love,\nbut gave a loose to her sorrow in the most immoderate expressions of\nanguish and affliction, and, while his delirium lasted, behaved with\nall the agitation of a despairing shepherdess."

  "content": "Ferdinand was, or pretended to be, the last person in the family who\nunderstood the situation of her thoughts; when he perceived her\npassion, he entered into deliberation with himself, and tasked his\nreflection and foresight, in order to discover how best he might\nconvert this conquest to his own advantage. Here, then, that we may\nneglect no opportunity of doing justice to our hero, it will be proper\nto observe, that, howsoever unapt his understanding might be to receive\nand retain the usual culture of the schools, he was naturally a genius\nself-taught, in point of sagacity and invention.—He dived into the\ncharacters of mankind, with a penetration peculiar to himself, and, had\nhe been admitted as a pupil in any political academy, would have\ncertainly become one of the ablest statesmen in Europe.Having revolved all the probable consequences of such a connexion, he\ndetermined to prosecute an amour with the lady whose affection he had\nsubdued; because he hoped to interest her as an auxiliary in his grand\nscheme upon Mademoiselle, which he did not as yet think proper to lay\naside; for he was not more ambitious in the plan, than indefatigable in\nthe prosecution of it. He knew it would be impossible to execute his\naims upon the Count’s daughter under the eye of Teresa, whose natural\ndiscernment would be whetted with jealousy, and who would watch his\nconduct, and thwart his progress with all the vigilance and spite of a\nslighted maiden. On the other hand, he did not doubt of being able to\nbring her over to his interest, by the influence he had already gained,\nor might afterwards acquire over her passions; in which case, she would\neffectually espouse his cause, and employ her good offices with her\nmistress in his behalf; besides, he was induced by another motive,\nwhich, though secondary, did not fail in this case to have an effect\nupon his determination. He looked upon Teresa with the eyes of\nappetite, which he longed to gratify; for he was not at all dead to the\ninstigations of the flesh, though he had philosophy enough to resist\nthem, when he thought they interfered with his interest. Here the case\nwas quite different. His desire happened to be upon the side of his\nadvantage, and therefore, resolving to indulge it, he no sooner found\nhimself in a condition to manage such an adventure, than he began to\nmake gradual advances in point of warmth and particular complacency to\nthe love-sick maid."

  "content": "He first of all thanked her, in the most grateful terms, for the\nconcern she had manifested at his distemper, and the kind services he\nhad received from her during the course of it; he treated her upon all\noccasions with unusual affability and regard, assiduously courted her\nacquaintance and conversation, and contracted an intimacy that in a\nlittle time produced a declaration of love. Although her heart was too\nmuch intendered to hold out against all the forms of assault, far from\nyielding at discretion, she stood upon honourable terms, with great\nobstinacy of punctilio, and, while she owned he was master of her\ninclinations, gave him to understand, with a peremptory and resolute\nair, that he should never make a conquest of her virtue; observing,\nthat, if the passion he professed was genuine, he would not scruple to\ngive such a proof of it as would at once convince her of his sincerity;\nand that he could have no just cause to refuse her that satisfaction,\nshe being his equal in point of birth and situation; for, if he was the\ncompanion and favourite of the young Count, she was the friend and\nconfidant of Mademoiselle.He acknowledged the strength of her argument, and that her\ncondescension was greater than his deserts, but objected against the\nproposal, as infinitely prejudicial to the fortunes of them both. He\nrepresented the state of dependence in which they mutually stood; their\nutter incapacity to support one another under the consequences of a\nprecipitate match, clandestinely made, without the consent and\nconcurrence of their patrons. He displayed, with great eloquence, all\nthose gay expectations they had reason to entertain, from that eminent\ndegree of favour which they had already secured in the family; and set\nforth, in the most alluring colours, those enchanting scenes of\npleasure they might enjoy in each other, without that disagreeable\nconsciousness of a nuptial chain, provided she would be his associate\nin the execution of a plan which he had projected for their reciprocal\nconvenience.Having thus inflamed her love of pleasure and curiosity, he, with great\ncaution, hinted his design upon the young lady’s fortune, and,\nperceiving her listening with the most greedy attention, and perfectly\nripe for the conspiracy, he disclosed his intention at full length,\nassuring her, with the most solemn protestations of love and\nattachment, that, could he once make himself legal possessor of an\nestate which Mademoiselle inherited by the will of a deceased aunt, his\ndear Teresa should reap the happy fruits of his affluence, and wholly\nengross his time and attention.Such a base declaration our hero would not have ventured to make, had\nhe not implicitly believed the damsel was as great a latitudinarian as\nhimself, in point of morals and principle; and been well assured, that,\nthough he should be mistaken in her way of thinking, so far as to be\nthreatened with a detection of his purpose, he would always have it in\nhis power to refute her accusation as mere calumny, by the character he\nhad hitherto maintained, and the circumspection of his future conduct."

  "content": "He seldom or never erred in his observations on the human heart.\nTeresa, instead of disapproving, relished the plan in general, with\ndemonstrations of singular satisfaction. She at once conceived all the\nadvantageous consequences of such a scheme, and perceived in it only\none flaw, which, however, she did not think incurable. This defect was\nno other than a sufficient bond of union, by which they might be\neffectually tied down to their mutual interest. She foresaw, that, in\ncase Ferdinand should obtain possession of the prize, he might, with\ngreat ease, deny their contract, and disavow her claim of\nparticipation. She therefore demanded security, and proposed, as a\npreliminary of the agreement, that he should privately take her to\nwife, with a view to dispel all her apprehensions of his inconstancy or\ndeceit, as such a previous engagement would be a check upon his\nbehaviour, and keep him strictly to the letter of their contract.He could not help subscribing to the righteousness of this proposal,\nwhich, nevertheless, he would have willingly waived, on the supposition\nthat they could not possibly be joined in the bands of wedlock with\nsuch secrecy as the nature of the case absolutely required. This would\nhave been a difficulty soon removed, had the scene of the transaction\nbeen laid in the metropolis of England, where passengers are plied in\nthe streets by clergymen, who prostitute their characters and\nconsciences for hire, in defiance of all decency and law; but in the\nkingdom of Hungary, ecclesiastics are more scrupulous in the exercise\nof their function, and the objection was, or supposed to be, altogether\ninsurmountable; so that they were fain to have recourse to an\nexpedient, with which, after some hesitation, our she-adventurer was\nsatisfied. They joined hands in the sight of Heaven, which they called\nto witness, and to judge the sincerity of their vows, and engaged, in a\nvoluntary oath, to confirm their union by the sanction of the church,\nwhenever a convenient opportunity for so doing should occur."

  "content": "The scruples of Teresa being thus removed, she admitted Ferdinand to\nthe privileges of a husband, which he enjoyed in stolen interviews, and\nreadily undertook to exert her whole power in promoting his suit with\nher young mistress, because she now considered his interest as\ninseparably connected with her own. Surely nothing could be more absurd\nor preposterous than the articles of this covenant, which she insisted\nupon with such inflexibility. How could she suppose that her pretended\nlover would be restrained by an oath, when the very occasion of\nincurring it was an intention to act in violation of all laws human and\ndivine? and yet such ridiculous conjuration is commonly the cement of\nevery conspiracy, how dark, how treacherous, how impious soever it may\nbe: a certain sign that there are some remains of religion left in the\nhuman mind, even after every moral sentiment hath abandoned it; and\nthat the most execrable ruffian finds means to quiet the suggestions of\nhis conscience, by some reversionary hope of Heaven’s forgiveness.CHAPTER EIGHTTHEIR FIRST ATTEMPT; WITH A DIGRESSION WHICH SOME READERS MAY THINK\nIMPERTINENT.Be this as it will, our lovers, though real voluptuaries, amidst the\nfirst transports of their enjoyment did not neglect the great political\naim of their conjunction. Teresa’s bedchamber, to which our hero\nconstantly repaired at midnight, was the scene of their deliberations,\nand there it was determined that the damsel, in order to avoid\nsuspicion, should feign herself irritated at the indifference of\nFerdinand, her passion for whom was by this time no secret in the\nfamily; and that, with a view to countenance this affectation, he\nshould upon all occasions treat her with an air of loftiness and\ndisdain.So screened from all imputation of fraud, she was furnished by him with\nartful instructions how to sound the inclinations of her young\nmistress, how to recommend his person and qualifications by the sure\nmethods of contradiction, comparisons, revilings, and reproach; how to\nwatch the paroxysms of her disposition, inflame her passions, and\nimprove, for his advantage, those moments of frailty from which no\nwoman is exempted. In short, this consummate politician taught his\nagent to poison the young lady’s mind with insidious conversation,\ntending to inspire her with the love of guilty pleasure, to debauch her\nsentiments, and confound her ideas of dignity and virtue. After all,\nthe task is not difficult to lead the unpractised heart astray, by dint\nof those opportunities her seducer possessed. The seeds of insinuation\nseasonably sown upon the warm luxuriant soil of youth, could hardly\nfail of shooting up into such intemperate desires as he wanted to\nproduce, especially when cultured and cherished in her unguarded hours,\nby that stimulating discourse which familiarity admits, and the looser\npassions, ingrafted in every breast, are apt to relish and excuse."

  "content": "Fathom had previously reconnoitred the ground, and discovered some\nmarks of inflammability in Mademoiselle’s constitution; her beauty was\nnot such as to engage her in those gaieties of amusement which could\nflatter her vanity and dissipate her ideas; and she was of an age when\nthe little loves and young desires take possession of the fancy; he\ntherefore concluded, that she had the more leisure to indulge these\nenticing images of pleasure that youth never fails to create,\nparticularly in those who, like her, were addicted to solitude and\nstudy.Teresa, full fraught with the wily injunctions of her confederate, took\nthe field, and opened the campaign with such remarkable sourness in her\naspect when Ferdinand appeared, that her young lady could not help\ntaking notice of her affected chagrin, and asked the reason of such\napparent alteration in her way of thinking. Prepared for this question,\nthe other replied, in a manner calculated for giving Mademoiselle to\nunderstand, that, whatever impressions Ferdinand might have formerly\nmade on her heart, they were now altogether effaced by the pride and\ninsolence with which he had received her advances; and that her breast\nnow glowed with all the revenge of a slighted lover.To evince the sincerity of this declaration, she bitterly inveighed\nagainst him, and even affected to depreciate those talents, in which\nshe knew his chief merit to consist; hoping, by these means, to\ninterest Mademoiselle’s candour in his defence. So far the train\nsucceeded. That young lady’s love for truth was offended at the\ncalumnies that were vented against Ferdinand in his absence. She chid\nher woman for the rancour of her remarks, and undertook to refute the\narticles of his dispraise. Teresa supported her own assertions with\ngreat obstinacy, and a dispute ensued, in which her mistress was heated\ninto some extravagant commendations of our adventurer."

  "content": "His supposed enemy did not fail to make a report of her success, and to\nmagnify every advantage they had gained; believing, in good earnest,\nthat her lady’s warmth was the effect of a real passion for the\nfortunate Mr. Fathom. But he himself viewed the adventure in a\ndifferent light, and rightly imputed the violence of Mademoiselle’s\nbehaviour to the contradiction she had sustained from her maid, or to\nthe fire of her natural generosity glowing in behalf of innocence\ntraduced. Nevertheless, he was perfectly well pleased with the nature\nof the contest; because, in the course of such debates, he foresaw that\nhe should become habitually her hero, and that, in time, she would\nactually believe those exaggerations of his merit, which she herself\nhad feigned, for the honour of her own arguments.This presage, founded upon that principle of self-respect, without\nwhich no individual exists, may certainly be justified by manifold\noccurrences in life. We ourselves have known a very pregnant example,\nwhich we shall relate, for the emolument of the reader. A certain needy\nauthor having found means to present a manuscript to one of those sons\nof fortune who are dignified with the appellation of patrons, instead\nof reaping that applause and advantage with which he had regaled his\nfancy, had the mortification to find his performance treated with\ninfinite irreverence and contempt, and, in high dudgeon and\ndisappointment, appealed to the judgment of another critic, who, he\nknew, had no veneration for the first.This common consolation, to which all baffled authors have recourse,\nwas productive of very happy consequences to our bard; for, though the\nopinions of both judges concerning the piece were altogether the same,\nthe latter, either out of compassion to the appellant, or desire of\nrendering his rival ridiculous in the eye of taste, undertook to repair\nthe misfortune, and in this manner executed the plan. In a meeting of\nliterati, to which both these wits belonged, he who had espoused the\npoet’s cause, having previously desired another member to bring his\ncomposition on the carpet, no sooner heard it mentioned, than he began\nto censure it with flagrant marks of scorn, and, with an ironical air,\nlooking at its first condemner, observed, that he must be furiously\ninfected with the rage of patronising, who could take such a deplorable\nperformance into his protection. The sarcasm took effect."

A rejoinder\nsucceeded this reply, and produced a long train of altercation, in\nwhich the gentleman, who had formerly treated the book with such\ndisrespect, now professed himself its passionate admirer, and held\nforth in praise of it with great warmth and elocution.Not contented with having exhibited this instance of regard, he next\nmorning sent a message to the owner, importing, that he had but\nsuperficially glanced over the manuscript, and desiring the favour of\nperusing it a second time. Being indulged in this request, he\nrecommended it in terms of rapture to all his friends and dependants,\nand, by dint of unwearied solicitation, procured a very ample\nsubscription for the author.But, to resume the thread of our story. Teresa’s practices were not\nconfined to simple defamation. Her reproaches were contrived so as to\nimply some intelligence in favour of the person she reviled. In\nexemplifying his pertness and arrogance, she repeated his witty\nrepartee; on pretence of blaming his ferocity, she recounted proofs of\nhis spirit and prowess; and, in explaining the source of his vanity,\ngave her mistress to understand, that a certain young lady of fashion\nwas said to be enamoured of his person. Nor did this well-instructed\nunderstrapper omit those other parts of her cue which the principal\njudged necessary for the furtherance of his scheme. Her conversation\nbecame less guarded, and took a freer turn than usual; she seized all\nopportunities of introducing little amorous stories, the greatest part\nof which were invented for the purposes of warming her passions, and\nlowering the price of chastity in her esteem; for she represented all\nthe young lady’s contemporaries in point of age and situation, as so\nmany sensualists, who, without scruple, indulged themselves in the\nstolen pleasures of youth."

He redoubled, if possible, his deference and respect,\nwhetting his assiduity to the keenest edge of attention; and, in short,\nregulated his dress, conversation, and deportment, according to the\nfancy, turn, and prevailing humour of his young mistress. He, moreover,\nattempted to profit by her curiosity, which he knew to be truly\nfeminine; and having culled from the library of his patron certain\ndangerous books, calculated to debauch the minds of young people, left\nthem occasionally upon the table in his apartment, after having\ndirected Teresa to pick them up, as if by accident, in his absence, and\ncarry them off for the entertainment of Mademoiselle; nay, this crafty\nprojector found means to furnish his associate with some mischievous\npreparations, which were mingled in her chocolate, tea, or coffee, as\nprovocations to warm her constitution; yet all these machinations,\ningenious as they were, failed, not only in fulfilling their aim, but\neven in shaking the foundations of her virtue or pride, which stood\ntheir assaults unmoved, like a strong tower built upon a rock,\nimpregnable to all the tempestuous blasts of heaven.Not but that the conspirators were more than once mistaken in the\neffects of their artifices, and disposed to applaud themselves on the\nprogress they had made. When at any time she expressed a desire to\nexamine those performances which were laid before her as snares to\nentrap her chastity, they attributed that, which was no other than\ncuriosity, to a looseness of sentiment; and when she discovered no\naversion to hear those anecdotes concerning the frailty of her\nneighbours, they imputed to abatement of chastity that satisfaction\nwhich was the result of self-congratulation on her own superior virtue.So far did the treacherous accomplice of Fathom presume upon these\nmisconstructions, that she at length divested her tongue of all\nrestraint, and behaved in such a manner, that the young lady,\nconfounded and incensed at her indecency and impudence, rebuked her\nwith great severity, and commanded her to reform her discourse, on pain\nof being dismissed with disgrace from her service.CHAPTER NINETHE CONFEDERATES CHANGE THEIR BATTERY, AND ACHIEVE A REMARKABLE\nADVENTURE."

  "content": "Thunderstruck at this disappointment, the confederates held a council,\nin order to deliberate upon the next measures that should be taken; and\nFerdinand, for the present, despairing of accomplishing his grand aim,\nresolved to profit in another manner, by the conveniency of his\nsituation. He represented to his helpmate, that it would be prudent for\nthem to make hay while the sun shone, as their connexion might be\nsooner or later discovered, and an end put to all those opportunities\nwhich they now so happily enjoyed. All principles of morality had been\nalready excluded from their former plan; consequently he found it an\neasy task to interest Teresa in any other scheme tending to their\nmutual advantage, howsoever wicked and perfidious it might be. He\ntherefore persuaded her to be his auxiliary in defrauding Mademoiselle\nat play, and gave her suitable directions for that purpose; and even\ntutored her how to abuse the trust reposed in her, by embezzling the\nyoung lady’s effects, without incurring the suspicion of dishonesty.On the supposition that every servant in the house was not able to\nresist such temptation, the purse of her mistress, to which the maid\nhad always access, was dropped in a passage which the domestics had\noccasion to frequent; and Fathom posted himself in a convenient place,\nin order to observe the effect of his stratagem. Here he was not\ndisappointed in his conjecture. The first person who chanced to pass\nthat way, was one of the chambermaids, with whom Teresa had lived for\nsome time in a state of inveterate enmity, because the wench had failed\nin that homage and respect which was paid to her by the rest of the\nservants.Ferdinand had, in his heart, espoused the quarrel of his associate, and\nlonged for an occasion to deliver her from the malicious observance of\nsuch an antagonist. When he, therefore, saw her approach, his heart\nthrobbed with joyful expectations; but, when she snatched up the purse,\nand thrust it in her bosom, with all the eagerness and confusion of one\ndetermined to appropriate the windfall to her own use, his transports\nwere altogether unspeakable. He traced her to her own apartment,\nwhither she immediately retreated with great trepidation, and then\ncommunicated the discovery to Teresa, together with instructions how to\nbehave in the sequel."

The young lady,\nhaving rummaged her pockets in vain, expressed some surprise at the\nloss of her purse; upon which her attendant gave indications of extreme\namazement and concern. She said, it could not possibly be lost;\nentreated her to search her escritoir, while she herself ran about the\nroom, prying into every corner, with all the symptoms of fear and\ndistraction. Having made this unsuccessful inquiry, she pretended to\nshed a flood of tears, bewailing her own fate, in being near the person\nof any lady who met with such a misfortune, by which, she observed, her\ncharacter might be called in question. She produced her own keys, and\nbegged upon her knees, that her chamber and boxes might be searched\nwithout delay.In a word, she demeaned herself so artfully upon this occasion, that\nher mistress, who never entertained the least doubt of her integrity,\nnow looked upon her as a miracle of fidelity and attachment, and was at\ninfinite pains to console her for the accident which had happened;\nprotesting that, for her own part, the loss of the money should never\naffect her with a moment’s uneasiness, if she could retrieve a certain\nmedal which she had long kept in her purse, as a remembrance of her\ndeceased aunt, from whom she received it in a present.Fathom entered accidentally into the midst of this well-acted scene,\nand, perceiving the agitation of the maid, and the concern of the\nmistress, desired, in a respectful manner, to know the cause of their\ndisorder. Before the young lady had time to make him acquainted with\nthe circumstances of the case, his accomplice exclaimed, in an affected\npassion, “Mr. Fathom, my lady has lost her purse; and, as no persons in\nthe family are so much about her as you and I, you must give me leave,\nin my own justification, to insist upon Mademoiselle’s ordering the\napartments of us both to be searched without loss of time. Here are my\npockets and my keys, and you cannot scruple to give her the same\nsatisfaction; for innocence has nothing to fear.”Miss Melvil reprimanded her sharply for her unmannerly zeal; and\nFerdinand eyeing her with a look of disdain, “Madam,” said he, “I\napprove of your proposal; but, before I undergo such mortification, I\nwould advise Mademoiselle to subject the two chambermaids to such\ninquiry; as they also have access to the apartments, and are, I\napprehend, as likely as you or I to behave in such a scandalous\nmanner.”"

The chambermaids\nbeing accordingly summoned, she calmly asked if either of them had\naccidentally found the purse she had dropped? and both replying in the\nnegative, she assumed an air of severity and determination, and\ndemanding their keys, threatened to examine their trunks on the\ninstant.The guilty Abigail, who, though an Hungarian, was not inferior, in\npoint of effrontery, to any one of the sisterhood in England, no sooner\nheard this menace, than she affected an air of affronted innocence,\nthanked God she had lived in many reputable families, and been trusted\nwith untold gold, but was never before suspected of theft; that the\nother maid might do as she should think proper, and be mean-spirited\nenough to let her things be tumbled topsy-turvy and exposed; but, for\nher own part, if she should be used in that inhuman and disgraceful\nmanner, she would not stay another hour in the house; and in conclusion\nsaid, that Mademoiselle had more reason to look sharp after those who\nenjoyed the greatest share of her favour, than believe their malicious\ninsinuations against innocent people whom they were well known to hate\nand defame.This declaration, implying an hint to the prejudice of Teresa, far from\ndiverting Miss Melvil from her purpose, served only to enhance the\ncharacter of the accused in her opinion, and to confirm her suspicion\nof the accuser, of whom she again demanded her keys, protesting that,\nshould she prove refractory, the Count himself should take cognisance\nof the affair, whereas, if she would deal ingenuously, she should have\nno cause to repent of her confession. So saying, she desired our\nadventurer to take the trouble of calling up some of the men-servants;\nupon which the conscious criminal began to tremble, and, falling upon\nher knees, acknowledged her guilt, and implored the forgiveness of her\nyoung mistress."

This adventure\nfully answered all the purposes of our politician; it established the\nopinion of his fellow-labourer’s virtue, beyond the power of accident\nor information to shake, and set up a false beacon to mislead the\nsentiments of Mademoiselle, in case she should for the future meet with\nthe like misfortune.CHAPTER TENTHEY PROCEED TO LEVY CONTRIBUTIONS WITH GREAT SUCCESS, UNTIL OUR HERO\nSETS OUT WITH THE YOUNG COUNT FOR VIENNA, WHERE HE ENTERS INTO LEAGUE\nWITH ANOTHER ADVENTURER.Under this secure cover, Teresa levied contributions upon her mistress\nwith great success. Some trinket was missing every day; the young\nlady’s patience began to fail; the faithful attendant was overwhelmed\nwith consternation, and, with the appearance of extreme chagrin,\ndemanded her dismission, affirming that these things were certainly\neffected by some person in the family, with a view of murdering her\nprecious reputation. Miss Melvil, not without difficulty, quieted her\nvexation with assurances of inviolable confidence and esteem, until a\npair of diamond earrings vanished, when Teresa could no longer keep her\naffliction within bounds. Indeed, this was an event of more consequence\nthan all the rest which had happened, for the jewels were valued at\nfive hundred florins."

She asked, if her daughter had reason to suspect any\nindividual in the family, and if she was perfectly confident of her own\nwoman’s integrity? Upon which Mademoiselle, with many encomiums on the\nfidelity and attachment of Teresa, recounted the adventure of the\nchambermaid, who immediately underwent a strict inquiry, and was even\ncommitted to prison, on the strength of her former misdemeanour. Our\nadventurer’s mate insisted upon undergoing the same trial with the rest\nof the domestics, and, as usual, comprehended Fathom in her\ninsinuations; while he seconded the proposal, and privately counselled\nthe old lady to introduce Teresa to the magistrate of the place. By\nthese preconcerted recriminations, they escaped all suspicion of\ncollusion. After a fruitless inquiry, the prisoner was discharged from\nher confinement, and turned out of the service of the Count, in whose\nprivate opinion the character of no person suffered so much, as that of\nhis own son, whom he suspected of having embezzled the jewels, for the\nuse of a certain inamorata, who, at that time, was said to have\ncaptivated his affections.The old gentleman felt upon this occasion all that internal anguish\nwhich a man of honour may be supposed to suffer, on account of a son’s\ndegeneracy; and, without divulging his sentiments, or even hinting his\nsuspicions to the youth himself, determined to detach him at once from\nsuch dangerous connexions, by sending him forthwith to Vienna, on\npretence of finishing his exercises at the academy, and ushering him\ninto acquaintance with the great world. Though he would not be thought\nby the young gentleman himself to harbour the least doubt of his\nmorals, he did not scruple to unbosom himself on that subject to\nFerdinand, whose sagacity and virtue he held in great veneration. This\nindulgent patron expressed himself in the most pathetic terms, on the\nuntoward disposition of his son; he told Fathom, that he should\naccompany Renaldo (that was the youth’s name) not only as a companion,\nbut a preceptor and pattern; conjured him to assist his tutor in\nsuperintending his conduct, and to reinforce the governor’s precepts by\nhis own example; to inculcate upon him the most delicate punctilios of\nhonour, and decoy him into extravagance, rather than leave the least\nilliberal sentiment in his heart."
