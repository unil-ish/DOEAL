  "content": "Influenced by this dire mistake, the breast of those unhappy lovers\nbegan to be invaded with the horrors of jealousy. The tender-hearted\nMonimia endeavoured to devour her griefs in silence; she in secret\nbemoaned her forlorn fate without ceasing; her tears flowed without\nintermission from night to morn, and from morn to night. She sought not\nto know the object for which she was forsaken; she meant not to upbraid\nher undoer; her aim was to find a sequestered corner, in which she\ncould indulge her sorrow; where she could brood over the melancholy\nremembrance of her former felicity; where she could recollect those\nhappy scenes she had enjoyed under the wings of her indulgent parents,\nwhen her whole life was a revolution of pleasures, and she was\nsurrounded with affluence, pomp, and admiration; where she could,\nunmolested, dwell upon the wretched comparison between her past and\npresent condition, and paint every circumstance of her misery in the\nmost aggravating colours, that they might make the deeper impression\nupon her mind, and the more speedily contribute to that dissolution for\nwhich she ardently wished, as a total release from woe.Amidst these pinings, she began to loathe all sustenance; her cheeks\ngrew wan, her bright eyes lost their splendour, the roses vanished from\nher lips, and her delicate limbs could hardly support their burden; in\na word, her sole consolation was limited to the prospect of depositing\nher sorrows in the grave; and her only wish was to procure a retreat in\nwhich she might wait with resignation for that happy period. Yet this\nmelancholy comfort she could not obtain without the advice and\nmediation of Fathom, whom she therefore still continued to see and\nconsult. While these consultations were held, Renaldo’s bosom was\nravaged with tempests of rage and distraction. He believed himself\nsuperseded in the affection of his mistress, by some favoured rival,\nwhose success rankled at his soul; and though he scarce durst\ncommunicate the suspicion to his own heart, his observation continually\nwhispered to him that he was supplanted by his friend Fathom; for\nMonimia was totally detached from the conversation of every other man,\nand he had of late noted their intercourse with distempered eyes."

  "content": "These considerations sometimes transported him to such a degree of\nfrenzy, that he was tempted to sacrifice them both as traitors to\ngratitude, friendship, and love; but such deliriums soon vanished\nbefore his honour and humanity. He would not allow himself to think\namiss of Ferdinand, until some undoubted mark of his guilt should\nappear; and this was so far from being the case, that hitherto there\nwas scarce a presumption. “On the contrary,” said he to himself, “I am\nhourly receiving proofs of his sympathy and attachment. Not but that he\nmay be the innocent cause of my mishap. His superior qualifications may\nhave attracted the eye, and engaged the heart of that inconstant fair,\nwithout his being sensible of the victory he has won; or, perhaps,\nshocked at the conquest he hath unwillingly made, he discourages her\nadvances, tries to reason down her unjustifiable passion, and in the\nmeantime conceals from me the particulars, out of regard to my\nhappiness and quiet.”Under cover of these favourable conjectures, our adventurer securely\nprosecuted his scheme upon the unfortunate Monimia. He dedicated\nhimself wholly to her service and conversation, except at those times\nwhen his company was requested by Renaldo, who now very seldom exacted\nhis attendance. In his ministry about the person of the beauteous\norphan, this cunning incendiary mingled such awful regard, such melting\ncompassion, as effectually screened him from the suspicion of\ntreachery, while he widened the fatal breach between her and her lover\nby the most diabolical insinuations. He represented his friend as a\nvoluptuary, who gratified his own appetite without the least regard to\nhonour or conscience; and, with a show of infinite reluctance, imparted\nsome anecdotes of his sensuality, which he had feigned for the purpose;\nthen he would exclaim in an affected transport, “Gracious Heaven! is it\npossible for any man who has the least title to perception or humanity\nto injure such innocence and perfection! for my own part, had I been so\nundeservedly happy—Heaven and earth! forgive my transports, madam, I\ncannot help seeing and admiring such divine attractions. I cannot help\nresenting your wrongs; it is the cause of virtue I espouse; it ought to\nbe the cause of every honest man.”"

  "content": "He had often repeated such apostrophes as these, which she ascribed to\nnothing else than sheer benevolence and virtuous indignation, and\nactually began to think he had made some impression upon her heart, not\nthat he now entertained the hope of an immediate triumph over her\nchastity. The more he contemplated her character, the more difficult\nthe conquest seemed to be: he therefore altered his plan, and resolved\nto carry on his operations under the shelter of honourable proposals,\nforeseeing that a wife of her qualifications, if properly managed,\nwould turn greatly to the account of the husband, or, if her virtue\nshould prove refractory, that he could at any time rid himself of the\nencumbrance, by decamping without beat of drum, after he should be\ncloyed with possession.Elevated by these expectations, he one day, in the midst of a\npreconcerted rhapsody, importing that he could no longer conceal the\nfire that preyed upon his heart, threw himself on his knees before the\nlovely mourner, and imprinted a kiss on her fair hand. Though he did\nnot presume to take this liberty till after such preparation as he\nthought had altogether extinguished her regard for Melvil, and paved\nthe way for his own reception in room of that discarded lover, he had\nso far overshot his mark, that Monimia, instead of favouring his\ndeclaration, started up, and retired in silence, her cheeks glowing\nwith shame, and her eyes gleaming with indignation.Ferdinand no sooner recovered from the confusion produced by this\nunexpected repulse, than he saw the necessity of coming to a speedy\ndetermination, lest the offended fair one should appeal to Renaldo, in\nwhich case they might be mutually undeceived, to his utter shame and\nconfusion; he therefore resolved to deprecate her anger by humble\nsupplications, and by protesting, that, whatever tortures he might\nsuffer by suppressing his sentiments, she should never again be\noffended with a declaration of his passion.Having thus appeased the gentle Monimia, and discovered that, in spite\nof her resentment, his friend still kept possession of her heart, he\ndetermined to work an effectual separation, so as that the young lady,\nbeing utterly deserted by Melvil, should be left altogether in his\npower. With this Christian intention, he began to sadden his visage\nwith a double shade of pensive melancholy, in the presence of Renaldo,\nto stifle a succession of involuntary sighs, to answer from the\npurpose, to be incoherent in his discourse, and, in a word, to act the\npart of a person wrapt up in sorrowful cogitation."

  "content": "Count Melvil, soon as he perceived these symptoms, very kindly inquired\ninto the cause of them, and was not a little alarmed to hear the artful\nand evasive answers of Ferdinand, who, without disclosing the source of\nhis disquiet, earnestly begged leave to retire into some other corner\nof the world. Roused by this entreaty, the Hungarian’s jealousy awoke,\nand with violent agitation, he exclaimed, “Then are my fears too true,\nmy dear Fathom: I comprehend the meaning of your request. I have for\nsome time perceived an host of horrors approaching from that quarter. I\nknow your worth and honour. I depend upon your friendship, and conjure\nyou, by all the ties of it, to free me at once from the most miserable\nsuspense, by owning you have involuntarily captivated the heart of that\nunhappy maiden.”To this solemn interrogation he made no reply, but shedding a flood of\ntears, of which he had always a magazine at command, he repeated his\ndesire of withdrawing, and took God to witness, that what he proposed\nwas solely for the quiet of his honoured patron and beloved friend.\n“Enough,” cried the unfortunate Renaldo, “the measure of my woes is now\nfilled up.” So saying, he fell backwards in a swoon, from which he was\nwith difficulty recovered to the sensation of the most exquisite\ntorments. During this paroxysm, our adventurer nursed him with infinite\ncare and tenderness, he exhorted him to summon all his fortitude to his\nassistance, to remember his forefathers, and exert himself in the\nimitation of their virtues, to fly from those bewitching charms which\nhad enslaved his better part, to retrieve his peace of mind by\nreflecting on the inconstancy and ingratitude of woman, and amuse his\nimagination in the pursuit of honour and glory."

  "content": "After these admonitions he abused his ears with a forged detail of the\ngradual advances made to him by Monimia, and the steps he had taken to\ndiscourage her addresses, and re-establish her virtue, poisoning the\nmind of that credulous youth to such a degree, that, in all\nprobability, he would have put a fatal period to his own existence, had\nnot Fathom found means to allay the rage of his ecstasy, by the cunning\narrangement of opposite considerations. He set his pride against his\nlove, he opposed his resentment to his sorrow, and his ambition to his\ndespair. Notwithstanding the balance of power so settled among these\nantagonists, so violent were the shocks of their successive conflicts,\nthat his bosom fared like a wretched province, harassed, depopulated,\nand laid waste, by two fierce contending armies. From this moment his\nlife was nothing but an alternation of starts and reveries; he wept and\nraved by turns, according to the prevailing gust of passion; food\nbecame a stranger to his lips, and sleep to his eyelids; he could not\nsupport the presence of Monimia, her absence increased the torture of\nhis pangs; and, when he met her by accident, he started back with\nhorror, like a traveller who chances to tread upon a snake.The poor afflicted orphan, worn to a shadow with self-consuming\nanguish, eager to find some lowly retreat, where she could breath out\nher soul in peace, and terrified at the frantic behaviour of Renaldo,\ncommunicated to Fathom her desire of removing, and begged that he would\ntake a small picture of her father, decorated with diamonds, and\nconvert them into money, for the expense of her subsistence. This was\nthe last pledge of her family, which she had received from her mother,\nwho had preserved it in the midst of numberless distresses, and no\nother species of misery but that which she groaned under could have\nprevailed upon the daughter to part with it; but, exclusive of other\nmotives, the very image itself, by recalling to her mind the honours of\nher name, upbraided her with living in dependence upon a man who had\ntreated her with such indignity and ingratitude; besides, she flattered\nherself with the hope that she should not long survive the loss of this\ntestimonial."

In the meantime, however, he repaired to his\nfriend Renaldo, and, after having admonished him to arm his soul with\npatience and philosophy, declared that Monimia’s guilty passion for\nhimself could no longer be kept within bounds, that she had conjured\nhim, in the most pressing manner, to assist her in escaping from an\nhouse which she considered as the worst of dungeons, because she was in\nit daily exposed to the sight and company of a man whom she detested,\nand that she had bribed him to compliance with her request, not only\nwith repeated promises of eternal love and submission, but also with\nthe picture of her father set with diamonds, which she had hitherto\nreserved as the last and greatest testimony of her affection and\nesteem.With these words he presented the fatal pledge to the eyes of the\nastonished youth, upon whom it operated like the poisonous sight of the\nbasilisk, for in an instant, the whole passions of his soul were in the\nmost violent agitation. “What!” cried he, in an ecstasy of rage, “is\nshe so abandoned to perfidy, so lost to shame, so damned to constancy,\nto gratitude, and virtuous love, as to meditate the means of leaving me\nwithout decency, without remorse! to forsake me in my adversity, when\nmy hapless fortune can no longer flatter the pride and vanity of her\nexpectation! O woman! woman! woman! what simile shall I find to\nillustrate the character of the sex? But I will not have recourse to\nvain complaints and feeble exclamations. By Heaven! she shall not\n’scape, she shall not triumph in her levity, she shall not exult in my\ndistress; no! I will rather sacrifice her to my just resentment, to the\ninjured powers of love and friendship. I will act the avenging minister\nof Heaven! I will mangle that fair bosom, which contains so false a\nheart! I will tear her to pieces, and scatter those beauteous limbs as\na prey to the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air!”"

Your endeavours to drive her from your thoughts must create an\nagony much more severe than that which divorces the soul from the body.\nNevertheless, I am so confident of your virtue and your manhood, as to\nforesee, that you will allow the fair Monimia to execute that\nresolution which she hath so unwisely taken, to withdraw herself from\nyour love and protection. Believe me, my best friend and benefactor,\nthis is a step, in consequence of which you will infallibly retrieve\nyour peace of mind. It may cost you many bitter pangs, it may probe\nyour wounds to the quick; but those pangs will be soothed by the gentle\nand salutary wing of time, and that probing will rouse you to a due\nsense of your own dignity and importance, which will enable you to\nconvert your attention to objects far more worthy of your\ncontemplation. All the hopes of happiness you had cherished in the\npossession of Monimia are now irrecoverably blasted; her heart is now\ndebased beneath your consideration; her love is, without all doubt,\nextinguished, and her honour irretrievably lost; insomuch, that, were\nshe to profess sorrow for her indiscretion, and implore your\nforgiveness, with the most solemn promises of regarding you for the\nfuture with unalterable fidelity and affection, you ought not to\nrestore her to that place in your heart which she hath so meanly\nforfeited, because you could not at the same time reinstate her in the\npossession of that delicate esteem without which there is no harmony,\nno rapture, no true enjoyment in love."

Your glory demands her dismission; the world\nwill applaud your generosity, and your own heart approve of your\nconduct. So disencumbered, let us exert ourselves once more in\npromoting your departure from this island, that you may revisit your\nfather’s house, do justice to yourself and amiable sister, and take\nvengeance on the author of your wrongs; then dedicate yourself to\nglory, in imitation of your renowned ancestors, and flourish in the\nfavour of your imperial patron.”These remonstrances had such an effect upon the Hungarian, that his\nface was lighted up with a transient gleam of satisfaction. He embraced\nFerdinand with great ardour, calling him his pride, his Mentor, his\ngood genius, and entreated him to gratify the inclination of that\nfickle creature so far as to convey her to another lodging, without\nloss of time, while he would, by absenting himself, favour their\nretreat.Our hero having obtained this permission, went immediately to the\nskirts of the town, where he had previously bespoke a small, though\nneat apartment, at the house of an old woman, widow of a French\nrefugee. He had already reconnoitred the ground, by sounding his\nlandlady, from whose poverty and complaisance he found reason to expect\nall sorts of freedom and opportunity for the accomplishment of his aim\nupon Monimia’s person. The room being prepared for her reception, he\nreturned to that disconsolate beauty, to whom he presented ten guineas,\nwhich he pretended to have raised by pledging the picture, though he\nhimself acted as the pawnbroker on this occasion, for a very plain and\nobvious reason.The fair orphan was overjoyed to find her wish so speedily\naccomplished. She forthwith packed up her necessaries in a trunk; and a\nhackney-coach was called in the dusk of the evening, in which she\nembarked with her baggage and conductor."

In the\ninstant of parting, the idea of that unfortunate youth was associated\nwith every well-known object that presented itself to her eyes; not as\nan inconstant, ungenerous, and perjured swain, but as the accomplished,\nthe virtuous, the melting lover, who had captivated her virgin heart.\nAs Fathom led her to the door, she was met by Renaldo’s dog, which had\nlong been her favourite; and the poor animal fawning upon her as she\npassed, her heart was overwhelmed with such a gush of tenderness, that\na flood of tears streamed down her cheeks, and she had well-nigh sunk\nupon the floor.Ferdinand, considering this emotion as the last tribute she would pay\nto Renaldo, hurried her into the coach, where she soon recovered her\ncomposure; and in a little time he ushered her into the house of Madam\nla Mer, by whom she was received with great cordiality, and conducted\nto her apartment, with which she found no other fault than that of its\nbeing too good for one in her forlorn situation. Here, while the tear\nof gratitude started in either eye, she thanked our adventurer for his\nbenevolence and kind concern, assuring him, that she would not fail\nduly to beseech the Most High to shower down blessings upon him, as the\norphan’s friend and protector.Fathom was not deficient in those expressions that were best adapted to\nher present turn of mind. He observed, that what he had done was in\nobedience to the dictates of common humanity, which would have prompted\nhim to assist any fellow-creature in distress; but that her peculiar\nvirtue and qualifications were such as challenged the utmost exertion\nof his faculties in her service. He said, that surely Heaven had not\ncreated such perfection in vain; that she was destined to receive as\nwell as to communicate happiness; and that the Providence, which she so\npiously adored, would not fail, in due season, to raise her from\ndistress and affliction, to that honour and felicity for which she was\ncertainly ordained. In the meantime, he entreated her to depend upon\nhis service and fidelity, and the article of her board being settled,\nhe left her to the company and consolation of her discreet hostess, who\nsoon insinuated herself into the good opinion of her beauteous lodger."

  "content": "While our hero was employed in this transaction, Renaldo sallied forth\nin a sort of intoxication, which Fathom’s admonitions had inspired;\nand, repairing to a certain noted coffee-house, engaged at chess with\nan old French refugee, that his attention, by being otherwise employed,\nmight not stray towards that fatal object which he ardently wished to\nforget. But, unluckily for him, he had scarce performed three moves of\nthe game, when his ears were exposed to a dialogue between two young\ngentlemen, one of whom asked the other if he would go and see the\n“Orphan” acted at one of the theatres; observing, as a farther\ninducement, that the part of Monimia would be performed by a young\ngentlewoman who had never appeared on the stage. At mention of that\nname, Renaldo started; for though it did not properly belong to his\norphan, it was the appellation by which she had been distinguished ever\nsince her separation from her father’s house, and therefore it recalled\nher to his imagination in the most interesting point of view. Though he\nendeavoured to expel the image, by a closer application to his play,\nevery now and then it intruded upon his fancy, and at each return made\na stronger impression; so that he found himself in the situation of an\nunfortunate bark stranded upon some hidden rock, which, when the wind\nbegins to blow, feels every succeeding wave more boisterous than the\nformer, until, with irresistible fury, they surmount her deck, sweep\neverything before them, and dash her all to pieces.The refugee had observed his first emotion, which he attributed to an\nunforeseen advantage he himself had gained over the Hungarian; but\nseeing him, in the sequel, bite his lip, roll his eyes, groan, writhe\nhis body, ejaculate incoherent curses, and neglect his game, the\nHuguenot concluded that he was mad, and being seized with terror and\ndismay, got up and scampered off, without ceremony or hesitation.Melvil, thus left to the horrors of his own thought, which tortured him\nwith the apprehension of losing Monimia for ever, could no longer\ncombat that suggestion, but ran homewards with all the speed he could\nexert, in order to prevent her retreat. When he crossed the threshold,\nhe was struck with such a damp of presaging fear, that he durst not in\nperson approach her apartment, nor even, by questioning the servant,\ninform himself of the particulars he wanted to know. Yet his suspense\nbecoming more insupportable than his fear, he rushed from room to room\nin quest of that which was not to be found; and, seeing Monimia’s\nchamber door open, entered the deserted temple in a state of\ndistraction, calling aloud upon her name. All was silent, solitary, and\nwoful. “She is gone,” he cried, shedding a flood of tears, “she is for\never lost; and all my hopes of happiness are fled!”So saying, he sunk upon that couch on which Monimia had oft reposed,\nand abandoned himself to all the excess of grief and despondence. In\nthis deplorable condition he was found by our adventurer, who gently\nchid him for his want of resolution, and again repelled his sorrow, by\narousing his resentment against the innocent cause of his disquiet,\nhaving beforehand forged the particulars of provocation."

Is it possible he can be\nso disturbed by the loss of a creature who is herself lost to all\nvirtue and decorum?—Time and reflection, my worthy friend, will cure\nyou of that inglorious malady. And the future misconduct of that\nimprudent damsel will, doubtless, contribute to the recovery of your\npeace. Her behaviour, at leaving the house where she had received so\nmany marks of the most delicate affection, was in all respects so\nopposite to honour and decency, that I could scarce refrain from\ntelling her I was shocked at her deportment, even while she loaded me\nwith protestations of love. When a woman’s heart is once depraved, she\nbids adieu to all restraint;—she preserves no measures. It was not\nsimply contempt which she expressed for Renaldo; she seems to resent\nhis being able to live under her disdain; and that resentment stoops to\nobjects unworthy of indignation. Even your dog was not exempted from\nthe effects of her displeasure. For, in her passage to the door, she\nkicked the poor animal as one of your dependents; and, in our way to\nthe apartment I had provided for her, she entertained me with a\nludicrous comment upon the manner in which you first made her\nacquainted with your passion. All that modesty of carriage, all that\nchastity of conversation, all that dignity of grief, which she knew so\nwell how to affect, is now entirely laid aside, and, when I quitted\nher, she seemed the most gay, giddy, and impertinent of her sex.”“Gracious powers!” exclaimed Renaldo, starting from the couch, “am I\nunder the delusion of a dream; or are these things really so, as my\nfriend has represented them? Such a total and sudden degeneracy is\namazing! is monstrous and unnatural!”“Such, my dear Count,” replied our hero, “is the caprice of a female\nheart, fickle as the wind, uncertain as a calm at sea, fixed to no\nprinciple, but swayed by every fantastic gust of passion, or of whim.\nCongratulate yourself, therefore, my friend, upon your happy\ndeliverance from such a domestic plague—upon the voluntary exile of a\ntraitor from your bosom.—Recollect the dictates of your duty, your\ndiscretion, and your glory, and think upon the honours and elevated\nenjoyment for which you are certainly ordained.

After\ndivers modish congees, he begged to know to what he should attribute\nthe honour of their message; when Ferdinand, who acted the orator, told\nhim, that his friend Count Melvil, having occasion for a sum of money,\nhad been directed to a gentleman of his name, “and, I suppose,” added\nhe, “you are the son of the person with whom the affair is to be\nnegotiated.”“Sir,” said this petit-maitre, with a smile, “I perceive you are\nsurprised to see one of my profession in the appearance of a gentleman;\nand perhaps your wonder will not cease, when I tell you, that my\neducation was liberal, and that I once had the honour to bear a\ncommission in the British army. I was indeed a first lieutenant of\nmarines, and will venture to say, that no officer in the service was\nmore delicate than myself in observing all the punctilios of honour. I\nentertained the utmost contempt for all the trading part of the nation,\nand suffered myself to be run through the body in a duel, rather than\nroll with a brother-lieutenant, who was a broker’s son. But, thank\nHeaven! I have long ago conquered all those ridiculous prejudices. I\nsoon observed, that without money there was no respect, honour, or\nconvenience to be acquired in life; that wealth amply supplied the want\nof wit, merit, and pedigree, having influence and pleasure ever at\ncommand; and that the world never failed to worship the flood of\naffluence, without examining the dirty channels through which it\ncommonly flowed.“At the end of the war, finding my appointments reduced to two\nshillings and fourpence per day, and being addicted to pleasures which\nI could not possibly purchase from such a fund, I sold my half-pay for\ntwo hundred pounds, which I lent upon bond to a young officer of the\nsame regiment, on condition that he should insure his life, and restore\none-fourth part of the sum by way of premium. I happened to be lucky in\nthis first essay; for the borrower, having in six weeks expended the\nmoney, made an excursion on the highway, was apprehended, tried,\nconvicted of felony, and cut his own throat, to prevent the shame of a\npublic execution; so that his bond was discharged by the insurers."

As he did not foresee what would happen, he had\nmade no provision for the demand, and his sphere of life secluding him\nfrom all sorts of monied intercourse, he could not raise the cash by\nhis credit in the usual way of borrowing; so that, without my\nassistance, he must have gone to jail; a disgrace which would have\nproved fatal to the peace of his family, and utterly ruined his\nreputation.—Nay, that very young gentleman, from whom I am just now\nparted, will, in all probability, be indebted to me for a very genteel\nlivelihood. He had obtained the absolute promise of being provided for\nby a great man, who sits at the helm of affairs in a neighbouring\nkingdom; but, being destitute of all other resources, he could not have\nequipped himself for the voyage, in order to profit by his lordship’s\nintention, unless I had enabled him to pursue his good fortune.”"

I own your countenance prepossesses me in your favour; and\nyou shall be accommodated, upon those terms from which I never deviate,\nprovided you can find proper security, that you shall not quit the\nBritish dominions; for that, with me, is a condition sine qua non.”This was a very disagreeable declaration to Renaldo, who candidly\nowned, that, as his concerns lay upon the Continent, his purpose was to\nleave England without delay. The usurer professed himself sorry that it\nwas not in his power to oblige him; and, in order to prevent any\nfurther importunity, assured them, he had laid it down as a maxim, from\nwhich he would never swerve, to avoid all dealings with people whom, if\nneed should be, he could not sue by the laws of this realm.Thus the intervention of one unlucky and unforeseen circumstance\nblasted in an instant the budding hopes of Melvil, who, while his\nvisage exhibited the most sorrowful disappointment, begged to know, if\nthere was any person of his acquaintance who might be less scrupulous\nin that particular."

This instance of politeness was, however, no more than a\nshift to disengage himself the more easily from their entreaties; for,\nwhen the case was opened to the second usurer, he blessed himself from\nsuch customers, and dismissed them with the most mortifying and boorish\nrefusal. Notwithstanding these repulses, Renaldo resolved to make one\ndesperate push; and, without allowing himself the least respite,\nsolicited, one by one, not fewer than fifteen persons who dealt in this\nkind of traffic, and his proposals were rejected by each. At last,\nfatigued by the toil, and exasperated at the ill success of his\nexpedition, and half mad with the recollection of his finances, which\nwere now drained to half-a-crown, “Since we have nothing to expect,”\ncried he, “from the favour of Christians, let us have recourse to the\ndescendants of Judah. Though they lie under the general reproach of\nnations, as a people dead to virtue and benevolence, and wholly devoted\nto avarice, fraud, and extortion, the most savage of their tribe cannot\ntreat me with more barbarity of indifference, than I have experienced\namong those who are the authors of their reproach.”Although Fathom looked upon this proposal as an extravagant symptom of\ndespair, he affected to approve of the scheme, and encouraged Renaldo\nwith the hope of succeeding in another quarter, even if this expedition\nshould fail; for, by this time, our adventurer was half resolved to\nexport him at his own charge, rather than he should be much longer\nrestricted in his designs upon Monimia.Meanwhile, being resolved to try the experiment upon the children of\nIsrael, they betook themselves to the house of a rich Jew, whose wealth\nthey considered as a proof of his rapaciousness; and, being admitted\ninto his counting-house, they found him in the midst of half a dozen\nclerks, when Renaldo, in his imagination, likened him unto a minister\nof darkness surrounded by his familiars, and planning schemes of misery\nto be executed upon the hapless sons of men. In spite of these\nsuggestions, which were not at all mitigated by the forbidding aspect\nof the Hebrew, he demanded a private audience; and, being ushered into\nanother apartment, he explained his business with manifest marks of\ndisorder and affliction. Indeed, his confusion was in some measure\nowing to the looks of the Jew, who, in the midst of this exordium,\npulled down his eyebrows, which were surprisingly black and bushy, so\nas, in appearance, totally to extinguish his visage, though he was all\nthe time observing our youth from behind those almost impenetrable\nthickets.Melvil, having signified his request, “Young gentleman,” said the\nIsraelite, with a most discordant voice, “what in the name of goodness\ncould induce you to come to me upon such an errand? Did you ever hear\nthat I lent money to strangers without security?” “No,” replied\nRenaldo, “nor did I believe I should profit by my application; but my\naffairs are desperate; and my proposals having been rejected by every\nChristian to whom they were offered, I was resolved to try my fate\namong the Jews, who are reckoned another species of men.”"

If you are really the\nCount de Melvil, you will excuse my caution. We cannot be too much on\nour guard against fraud; though I must own you have not the air of an\nimpostor.”Renaldo’s eyes began to sparkle at this preliminary question; to which\nhe replied, that he could procure the testimony of the Emperor’s\nminister, to whom he had occasionally paid his respects since his first\narrival in England.“If that be the case,” said the Jew, “take the trouble to call here\nto-morrow morning, at eight o’clock, and I will carry you in my own\ncoach to the house of his excellency, with whom I have the honour to be\nacquainted; and, if he has nothing to object against your character or\npretensions, I will contribute my assistance towards your obtaining\njustice at the Imperial court.”The Hungarian was so much confounded at this unexpected reception, that\nhe had not power to thank the merchant for his promised favour, but\nstood motionless and silent, while the streams of emotion of the heart\nwas of more weight with the Jew, than the eloquent acknowledgment which\nFerdinand took the opportunity of making for his friend; and he was\nfain to dismiss them a little abruptly, in order to prevent a second\ndischarge of that same rheum of which he had already complained."

He\nwas, in truth, overwhelmed with the obligation, and certainly disposed\nto believe that his benefactor was something more than human. As for\nFathom, his sentiments took a different turn; and he scrupled not to\nimpute all this kindness to some deep-laid interested scheme, the scope\nof which he could not at present comprehend."

He mentioned her\nname to Fathom with marks of the most melting compassion, deplored her\napostasy, and, while he protested that he had divorced her for ever\nfrom his heart, expressed an inclination to see her once more before\nhis departure, that he might in person exhort her to penitence and\nreformation.Our adventurer, who dreaded such an interview as the infallible means\nof his own ruin, resisted the proposal with the whole power of his\nelocution. He affirmed, that Renaldo’s desire was a manifest proof that\nhe still retained part of the fatal poison which that enchantress had\nspread within his veins; and that the sight of her, softened by his\nreproaches into tears and affected contrition, would dispel his\nresentment, disable his manhood, and blow the embers of his former\npassion to such a rage, as would hurry him on to a reconciliation,\nwhich would debase his honour, and ruin his future peace. In a word,\nFerdinand described the danger that would attend the meeting in such\nemphatic terms, that the Hungarian started with horror at the picture\nwhich he drew, and in this particular conformed with the admonition of\nhis friend.One hundred pounds of the Jew’s money was immediately appropriated for\nthe payment of his most urgent debts; the like sum he presented to his\nfriend Fathom, with a solemn promise of sharing with him whatever good\nfortune might await him in Germany. And though Monimia had forfeited\nall title to his regard, so ill could he bear the prospect of her\ndistress, that he entrusted his dear companion with the half of what\nremained, to be expended for her use, fully resolving to screen her\nfrom the shocks and temptations of want, as the circumstances of his\nfuture fate would allow.Fathom, far from opposing, applauded his generosity with marks of\nextreme wonder and admiration, assuring him, that she should be put in\npossession of his bounty immediately after his departure, he being\nunwilling to make her acquainted with her good fortune before that\nperiod, lest, finding his affairs in a fair way of being retrieved, she\nshould be base enough to worship his returning prosperity, and, by\nfalse professions, and artful blandishments, seek to ensnare his heart\nanew.CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT"

He had before\nsolicited him to be his fellow-traveller, that he might personally\nenjoy the benefit of his conversation and superior sagacity; but these\nentreaties he strenuously opposed, on pretence of his being determined\nto push his fortune in England, which he considered as his native\ncountry, and as the land in which, of all others, a man of merit has\nthe best encouragement. Such were the reasons he alleged for refusing\nto attend his benefactor, who was himself eagerly desirous of attaining\na settlement in the island of Great Britain. But our hero’s real\nmotives for staying were of a very different complexion.—The reader is\nalready informed of his aim upon the fair orphan, which, at present,\nwas the chief spring of his conduct. He may also recollect such\npassages of his life, as were sufficient to deter him from reappearing\nat Presburg or Vienna. But, besides these reflections, he was detained\nby a full persuasion that Renaldo would sink under the power and\ninfluence of his antagonist, consequently be rendered incapable to\nprovide for his friends; and that he himself, fraught with wiles and\nexperience as he was, could not fail to make himself amends for what he\nhad suffered among a people equally rich and unthinking."

He found her in the attitude of\nwriting a letter to her inconstant lover, the contents of which the\nreader will be acquainted with in due time. Her countenance,\nnotwithstanding the veil of melancholy by which it was overcast, seemed\naltogether serene and composed; she was the picture of pious\nresignation, and sat like PATIENCE on a monument, smiling at grief.\nAfter having paid the compliment of the morning, Fathom begged pardon\nfor having omitted to visit her during three days, in which, he said,\nhis time had been wholly engrossed in procuring a proper equipage for\nCount Melvil, who had at last bid an eternal adieu to the island of\nGreat Britain.At this information the hapless Monimia fell back in her chair, and\ncontinued some minutes in a swoon; from which being recovered, “Excuse\nme, Mr. Fathom,” cried she with a deep sigh; “this, I hope, is the last\nagony I shall feel from my unhappy passion.”—Then wiping the tears from\nher lovely eyes, she retrieved her tranquillity, and desired to know by\nwhat means Renaldo had been enabled to undertake his journey into the\nempire. Our hero, upon this occasion, assumed the whole merit of having\npromoted the interest of his friend, by giving her to understand, that\nhe, in consequence of an unforeseen windfall, had defrayed the expense\nof the Count’s equipment; though he observed, that it was not without\nreluctance he saw Renaldo make a wrong use of his friendship.“Although I was happy,” proceeded this artful traitor, “in being able\nto discharge my obligations to the house of Melvil, I could not help\nfeeling the most sensible chagrin, when I saw my assistance rendered\nsubservient to the triumphs of the youth’s baseness and infidelity; for\nhe chose, as the companion of his travels, the abandoned woman for whom\nhe had forsaken the all-perfect Monimia, whose virtue and\naccomplishments did not preserve her sacred from his ungrateful\nsarcasms and unmannerly ridicule. Believe me, madam, I was so shocked\nat his conversation on that subject, and so much incensed at his want\nof delicacy, that my temper was scarce sufficient for the ceremony of\nparting. And, now that my debt to his family is over-paid, I have\nsolemnly renounced his correspondence.”"
