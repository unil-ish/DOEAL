  "content": "Renaldo’s life was now become a sacrifice to the most poignant\ndistress. Almost his whole time was engrossed by a double scheme,\ncomprehending his efforts to render his departure practicable, and his\nexpedients for raising the means of daily bread. With regard to the\nfirst, he exerted himself among a set of merchants, some of whom knew\nhis family and expectations; and, for the last, he was fain to depend\nupon the assistance of a few intimates, who were not in a condition to\nfurnish him with sums of consequence. These, however, gradually dropped\noff, on pretence of friendly resentment for his indiscreet conduct; so\nthat he found himself naked and deserted by all his former companions,\nexcept one gentleman, with whom he had lived in the most unreserved\ncorrespondence, as with a person of the warmest friendship, and the\nmost unbounded benevolence; nay, he had actually experienced repeated\nproofs of his generosity; and such were the Count’s sentiments of the\ngratitude, love, and esteem, which were due to the author of these\nobligations, that he would have willingly laid down his own life for\nhis interest or advantage. He had already been at different times\naccommodated by this benefactor with occasional supplies, amounting in\nthe whole to about forty or fifty pounds; and so fearful was he of\ntaking any step by which he might forfeit the goodwill of this\ngentleman, that he struggled with unparelleled difficulty and vexation,\nbefore he could prevail upon himself to put his liberality to another\nproof.What maxims of delicacy will not the dire calls of necessity infringe!\nReduced to the alternative of applying once more to that beneficence\nwhich had never failed him, or of seeing Monimia starve, he chose the\nfirst, as of two evils the least, and intrusted Fathom with a letter\nexplaining the bitterness of his case. It was not without trepidation\nthat he received in the evening from his messenger an answer to this\nbillet; but what were his pangs when he learned the contents! The\ngentleman, after having professed himself Melvil’s sincere well-wisher,\ngave him to understand, that he was resolved for the future to detach\nhimself from every correspondence which would be inconvenient for him\nto maintain; that he considered his intimacy with the Count in that\nlight; yet, nevertheless, if his distress was really as great as he had\ndescribed it, he would still contribute something towards his relief;\nand accordingly had sent by the bearer five guineas for that purpose;\nbut desired him to take notice, that, in so doing, he laid himself\nunder some difficulty."

  "content": "Renaldo’s grief and mortification at this disappointment were\nunspeakable. He now saw demolished the last screen betwixt him and the\nextremity of indigence and woe; he beheld the mistress of his soul\nabandoned to the bleakest scenes of poverty and want; and he deeply\nresented the lofty strain of the letter, by which he conceived himself\ntreated as a worthless spendthrift and importunate beggar. Though his\npurse was exhausted to the last shilling; though he was surrounded with\nnecessities and demands, and knew not how to provide another meal for\nhis fair dependent, he, in opposition to all the suggestions and\neloquence of Fathom, despatched him with the money and another billet,\nintimating, in the most respectful terms, that he approved of his\nfriend’s new-adopted maxim, which, for the future, he should always\ntake care to remember; and that he had sent back the last instance of\nhis bounty, as a proof how little he was disposed to incommode his\nbenefactor.This letter, though sincerely meant, and written in a very serious\nmood, the gentleman considered as an ungrateful piece of irony, and in\nthat opinion complained to several persons of the Count’s acquaintance,\nwho unanimously exclaimed against him as a sordid, unthankful, and\nprofligate knave, that abused and reviled those very people who had\ngenerously befriended him, whenever they found it inconvenient to\nnourish his extravagance with further supplies. Notwithstanding these\naccumulated oppressions, he still persevered with fortitude in his\nendeavours to disentangle himself from this maze of misery. To these he\nwas encouraged by a letter which about this time he received from his\nsister, importing, that she had good reason to believe the real will of\nher father had been suppressed for certain sinister views; and desiring\nhim to hasten his departure for Hungary, where he would still find some\nfriends who were both able and willing to support his cause. He had\nsome trinkets left; the pawnbroker’s shop was still open; and hitherto\nhe made shift to conceal from Monimia the extent of his affliction.The money-broker whom he employed, after having amused him with a\nvariety of schemes, which served no other purpose than that of\nprotracting his own job, at length undertook to make him acquainted\nwith a set of monied men who had been very venturous in lending sums\nupon personal security; he was therefore introduced to their club in\nthe most favourable manner, after the broker had endeavoured to\nprepossess them separately, with magnificent ideas of his family and\nfortune.—By means of this anticipation he was received with a manifest\nrelaxation of that severity which people of this class mingle in their\naspects to the world in general; and they even vied with each other in\ntheir demonstrations of hospitality and respect; for every one in\nparticular looked upon him as a young heir, who would bleed freely, and\nmortgage at cent. per cent."

  "content": "Renaldo, buoyed up with these exterior civilities, began to flatter\nhimself with hopes of success, which, however, were soon checked by the\nnature of the conversation; during which the chairman upbraided one of\nthe members in open club for having once lent forty pounds upon slight\nsecurity. The person accused alleged, in his own defence, that the\nborrower was his own kinsman, whose funds he knew to be sufficient;\nthat he had granted his bond, and been at the expense of insuring his\nlife for the money; and, in conclusion, had discharged it to the day\nwith great punctuality. These allegations were not deemed exculpatory\nby the rest of the assembly, who with one voice pronounced him guilty\nof unwarrantable rashness and indiscretion, which, in time coming, must\nundoubtedly operate to the prejudice of his character and credit.This was a bitter declaration to the young Count, who nevertheless\nendeavoured to improve the footing he had gained among them, by\ncourting their company, conforming to their manners, and attentively\nlistening to their discourse. When he had cultivated them with great\nassiduity for the space of some weeks, dined at their houses upon\npressing invitations, and received repeated offers of service and\nfriendship, believing that things were now ripe for the purpose, he,\none day, at a tavern to which he had invited him to dinner, ventured to\ndisclose his situation to him whose countenance was the least\nunpromising; and as he introduced the business with a proposal of\nborrowing money, he perceived his eyes sparkle with a visible alacrity,\nfrom which he drew a happy presage. But, alas! this was no more than a\ntransient gleam of sunshine, which was suddenly obumbrated by the\nsequel of his explanation; insomuch, that, when the merchant understood\nthe nature of the security, his visage was involved in a most\ndisagreeable gloom, and his eyes distorted into a most hideous\nobliquity of vision; indeed, he squinted so horribly, that Renaldo was\namazed and almost affrighted at his looks, until he perceived that this\ndistortion proceeded from concern for a silver tobacco box which he had\nlaid down by him on the table, after having filled his pipe. As the\nyouth proceeded to unfold his necessities, the other became gradually\nalarmed for this utensil, to which he darted his eyes askance in this\npreternatural direction, until he had slyly secured it in his pocket."

  "content": "Having made this successful conveyance, he shifted his eyes alternately\nfrom the young gentleman to the broker for a considerable pause, during\nwhich he in silence reproached the last for introducing such a beggarly\nvarlet to his acquaintance; then taking the pipe from his mouth, “Sir,”\nsaid he, addressing himself to the Count, “if I had all the inclination\nin the world to comply with your proposal, it is really not in my\npower. My correspondents abroad have remitted such a number of bad\nbills of late, that all my running cash hath been exhausted in\nsupporting their credit. Mr. Ferret, sure I am, you was not ignorant of\nmy situation; and I’m not a little surprised that you should bring the\ngentleman to me on business of this kind; but, as the wise man\nobserves, Bray a fool in a mortar, and he’ll never be wise.” So saying,\nwith a most emphatic glance directed to the broker, he rung the bell,\nand called for the reckoning; when, finding that he was to be the guest\nof Renaldo, he thanked him drily for his good cheer, and in an abrupt\nmanner took himself away.Though baffled in this quarter, the young gentleman would not despair;\nbut forthwith employed Mr. Ferret in an application to another of the\nsociety; who, after having heard the terms of his commission, desired\nhim to tell his principal, that he could do nothing without the\nconcurrence of his partner, who happened to be at that time in one of\nour American plantations. A third being solicited, excused himself on\naccount of an oath which he had lately taken on the back of a\nconsiderable loss. A fourth being tried, made answer, that it was not\nin his way. And a fifth candidly owned, that he never lent money\nwithout proper security."

  "content": "Thus the forlorn Renaldo tried every experiment without success, and\nnow saw the last ray of hope extinguished. Well-nigh destitute of\npresent support, and encompassed with unrelenting duns, he was obliged\nto keep within doors, and seek some comfort in the conversation of his\ncharming mistress, and his faithful friend; yet, even there, he\nexperienced the extremest rigour of adverse fate. Every rap at the door\nalarmed him with the expectation of some noisy tradesman demanding\npayment. When he endeavoured to amuse himself with drawing, some\nunlucky feature of the occasional portrait recalled the image of an\nobdurate creditor, and made him tremble at the work of his own hands.\nWhen he fled for shelter to the flattering creation of fancy, some\nabhorred idea always started up amidst the gay vision, and dissolved\nthe pleasing enchantment.—Even the seraphic voice of Monimia had no\nlonger power to compose the anxious tumults of his mind. Every song she\nwarbled, every tune she played, recalled to his remembrance some scene\nof love and happiness elapsed; and overwhelmed his soul with the woful\ncomparison of past and present fate. He saw all that was amiable and\nperfect in woman, all that he held most dear and sacred upon earth,\ntottering on the brink of misery, without knowing the danger of her\nsituation, and found himself unable to prevent her fall, or even to\nforewarn her of the peril; for as we have already observed, his soul\ncould not brook the thought of communicating the tidings of distress to\nthe tender-hearted Monimia.CHAPTER FORTY-FIVERENALDO’S DISTRESS DEEPENS, AND FATHOM’S PLOT THICKENS.Such aggravated misfortune could not fail to affect his temper and\ndeportment. The continual efforts he made to conceal his vexation\nproduced a manifest distraction in his behaviour and discourse. He\nbegan to be seized with horror at the sight of poor Monimia, whom he\ntherefore shunned as much as the circumstances of their correspondence\nwould allow; and every evening he went forth alone to some solitary\nplace, where he could, unperceived, give a loose to the transports of\nhis sorrow, and in silence meditate some means to lighten the burden of\nhis woe. His heart was sometimes so savaged with despair, which\nrepresented mankind as his inveterate enemies, that he entertained\nthoughts of denouncing war against the whole community, and supplying\nhis own wants with the spoils he should win. At other times he was\ntempted with the desire of putting an end to his miseries and life\ntogether. Yet these were but the transitory suggestions of temporary\nmadness, that soon yielded to the dictates of reason. From the\nexecution of the first he was restrained by his own notions of honour\nand morality; and, from using the other expedient, he was deterred by\nhis love for Monimia, together with the motives of philosophy and\nreligion."

She was alarmed at the\nchange, yet afraid to inquire into the source of it; for, being\nignorant of his distress, she could impute it to no cause in which her\nhappiness was not deeply interested. She had observed his strained\ncomplaisance and extraordinary emotion. She had detected him in\nrepeated attempts to avoid her company, and taken notice of his regular\nexcursions in the dark. These were alarming symptoms to a lover of her\ndelicacy and pride. She strove in vain to put the most favourable\nconstruction on what she saw; and, finally, imputed the effects of his\ndespondence to the alienation of his heart. Made miserable beyond\nexpression by these suspicions, she imparted them to Fathom, who, by\nthis time, was in full possession of her confidence and esteem, and\nimplored his advice touching her conduct in such a nice conjuncture.This artful politician, who rejoiced at the effect of her penetration,\nno sooner heard himself questioned on the subject, than he gave tokens\nof surprise and confusion, signifying his concern to find she had\ndiscovered what, for the honour of his friend, he wished had never come\nto light. His behaviour on this occasion confirmed her fatal\nconjecture; and she conjured him, in the most pathetic manner, to tell\nher if he thought Renaldo’s heart had contracted any new engagement. At\nthis question, he started with signs of extreme agitation, and stifling\nan artificial sigh, “Sure, madam,” said he, “you cannot doubt the\nCount’s constancy—I am confident—he is certainly—I protest, madam, I am\nso shocked.”Here he made a full pause, as if the conflict between his integrity and\nhis friendship would not allow him to proceed, and summoned the\nmoisture into either eye—“Then are my doubts removed,” cried the\nafflicted Monimia; “I see your candour in the midst of your attachment\nto Renaldo; and will no longer torment you with impertinent\ninterrogations and vain complaints.” With these words, a flood of tears\ngushed from her enchanting eyes, and she instantly withdrew into her\nown apartment, where she indulged her sorrow to excess. Nor was her\ngrief unanimated with resentment. She was by birth, nature, and\neducation inspired with that dignity of pride which ennobles the human\nheart; and this, by the circumstance of her present dependence, was\nrendered extremely jealous and susceptible; insomuch that she could not\nbrook the least shadow of indifference, much less an injury of such a\nnature, from the man whom she had honoured with her affections, and for\nwhom she had disobliged and deserted her family and friends."

This pretext of friendly concern is the most\neffectual vehicle for the conveyance of malice and slander; and a man’s\nreputation is never so mortally stabbed, as when the assassin begins\nwith the preamble of, “For my own part, I can safely say that no man\nupon earth has a greater regard for him than I have; and it is with the\nutmost anguish and concern that I see him misbehave in such a manner.”\nThen he proceeds to mangle his character, and the good-natured hearers,\nconcluding he is even blacker than he is represented, on the\nsupposition that the most atrocious circumstances are softened or\nsuppressed by the tenderness or friendship of the accuser, exclaim,\n“Good lack! what a wretch he must be, when his best friends will no\nlonger attempt to defend him!” Nay, sometimes these well-wishers\nundertake his defence, and treacherously betray the cause they have\nespoused, by omitting the reasons that may be urged in his vindication."

  "content": "Both these methods were practised by the wily Ferdinand, according to\nthe predominant passion of Monimia. When her indignation prevailed, he\nexpatiated upon his love and sincere regard for Renaldo, which, he\nsaid, had grown up from the cradle, to such a degree of fervour, that\nhe would willingly part with life for his advantage. He shed tears for\nhis apostasy; but every drop made an indelible stain upon his\ncharacter; and, in the bitterness of his grief, swore, notwithstanding\nhis fondness for Renaldo, which had become a part of his constitution,\nthat the young Hungarian deserved the most infamous destiny for having\ninjured such perfection. At other times, when he found her melted into\nsilent sorrow, he affected to excuse the conduct of his friend. He\ninformed her, that the young gentleman’s temper had been uneven from\nhis infancy; that frailty was natural to man; that he might in time be\nreclaimed by self-conviction; he even hinted, that she might have\nprobably ascribed to inconstancy, what was really the effect of some\nchagrin which he industriously concealed from his participation. But,\nwhen he found her disposed to listen to this last suggestion, he\ndestroyed the force of it, by recollecting the circumstances of his\nnocturnal rambles, which, he owned, would admit of no favourable\nconstruction.By these means he blew the coals of her jealousy, and enhanced the\nvalue of his own character at the same time; for she looked upon him as\na mirror of faith and integrity, and the mind being overcharged with\nwoe, naturally seeks some confidant, upon whose sympathy it can repose\nitself. Indeed, his great aim was to make himself necessary to her\naffliction, and settle a gossiping correspondence, in the familiarity\nof which he hoped his purpose would certainly be answered.Yet the exertion of these talents was not limited to her alone. While\nhe laid these trains for the hapless young lady, he was preparing\nsnares of another kind for her unsuspecting lover, who, for the\ncompletion of his misery, about this time began to perceive marks of\ndisquiet and displeasure in the countenance and deportment of his\nadored Monimia. For that young lady, in the midst of her grief,\nremembered her origin, and over her vexation affected to throw a veil\nof tranquillity, which served only to give an air of disgust to her\ninternal disturbance."

Yet this was but a wretched\ncordial to support him against the baleful reflections that assaulted\nhim from every quarter; it operated like those desperate remedies,\nwhich, while they stimulate exhausted nature, help to destroy the very\nfundamentals of the constitution. He reviewed his own conduct with the\nutmost severity, and could not recollect one circumstance which could\njustly offend the idol of his soul. The more blameless he appeared to\nhimself in this examination, the less excusable did her behaviour\nappear. He tasked his penetration to discover the cause of this\nalteration; he burned with impatience to know it; his discernment\nfailed him, and he was afraid, though he knew not why, to demand an\nexplanation. His thoughts were so circumstanced, that he durst not even\nunbosom himself to Fathom, though his own virtue and friendship\nresisted those sentiments that began to intrude upon his mind, with\nsuggestions to the prejudice of our adventurer’s fidelity.Nevertheless, unable to endure the torments of such interesting\nsuspense, he at length made an effort to expostulate with the fair\norphan; and in an abrupt address, the effect of his fear and confusion,\nbegged to know if he had inadvertently done anything to incur her\ndispleasure. Monimia, hearing herself bluntly accosted in this unusual\nstrain, after repeated instances of his reserve and supposed\ninconstancy, considered the question as a fresh insult, and, summoning\nher whole pride to her assistance, replied, with affected tranquillity,\nor rather with an air of scorn, that she had no title to judge, neither\ndid she pretend to condemn his conduct. This answer, so wide of that\ntenderness and concern which had hitherto manifested itself in the\ndisposition of his amiable mistress, deprived him of all power to carry\non the conversation, and he retired with a low bow, fully convinced of\nhis having irretrievably lost the place he had possessed in her\naffection; for, to his imagination, warped and blinded by his\nmisfortunes, her demeanour seemed fraught, not with a transient gleam\nof anger, which a respectful lover would soon have appeased, but with\nthat contempt and indifference which denote a total absence of\naffection and esteem. She, on the other hand, misconstrued his sudden\nretreat; and now they beheld the actions of each other through the\nfalse medium of prejudice and resentment. To such fatal\nmisunderstandings the peace and happiness of whole families often fall\na sacrifice.CHAPTER FORTY-SIXOUR ADVENTURER BECOMES ABSOLUTE IN HIS POWER OVER THE PASSIONS OF HIS\nFRIEND, AND EFFECTS ONE HALF OF HIS AIM."

  "content": "Influenced by this dire mistake, the breast of those unhappy lovers\nbegan to be invaded with the horrors of jealousy. The tender-hearted\nMonimia endeavoured to devour her griefs in silence; she in secret\nbemoaned her forlorn fate without ceasing; her tears flowed without\nintermission from night to morn, and from morn to night. She sought not\nto know the object for which she was forsaken; she meant not to upbraid\nher undoer; her aim was to find a sequestered corner, in which she\ncould indulge her sorrow; where she could brood over the melancholy\nremembrance of her former felicity; where she could recollect those\nhappy scenes she had enjoyed under the wings of her indulgent parents,\nwhen her whole life was a revolution of pleasures, and she was\nsurrounded with affluence, pomp, and admiration; where she could,\nunmolested, dwell upon the wretched comparison between her past and\npresent condition, and paint every circumstance of her misery in the\nmost aggravating colours, that they might make the deeper impression\nupon her mind, and the more speedily contribute to that dissolution for\nwhich she ardently wished, as a total release from woe.Amidst these pinings, she began to loathe all sustenance; her cheeks\ngrew wan, her bright eyes lost their splendour, the roses vanished from\nher lips, and her delicate limbs could hardly support their burden; in\na word, her sole consolation was limited to the prospect of depositing\nher sorrows in the grave; and her only wish was to procure a retreat in\nwhich she might wait with resignation for that happy period. Yet this\nmelancholy comfort she could not obtain without the advice and\nmediation of Fathom, whom she therefore still continued to see and\nconsult. While these consultations were held, Renaldo’s bosom was\nravaged with tempests of rage and distraction. He believed himself\nsuperseded in the affection of his mistress, by some favoured rival,\nwhose success rankled at his soul; and though he scarce durst\ncommunicate the suspicion to his own heart, his observation continually\nwhispered to him that he was supplanted by his friend Fathom; for\nMonimia was totally detached from the conversation of every other man,\nand he had of late noted their intercourse with distempered eyes."

He would not allow himself to think\namiss of Ferdinand, until some undoubted mark of his guilt should\nappear; and this was so far from being the case, that hitherto there\nwas scarce a presumption. “On the contrary,” said he to himself, “I am\nhourly receiving proofs of his sympathy and attachment. Not but that he\nmay be the innocent cause of my mishap. His superior qualifications may\nhave attracted the eye, and engaged the heart of that inconstant fair,\nwithout his being sensible of the victory he has won; or, perhaps,\nshocked at the conquest he hath unwillingly made, he discourages her\nadvances, tries to reason down her unjustifiable passion, and in the\nmeantime conceals from me the particulars, out of regard to my\nhappiness and quiet.”Under cover of these favourable conjectures, our adventurer securely\nprosecuted his scheme upon the unfortunate Monimia. He dedicated\nhimself wholly to her service and conversation, except at those times\nwhen his company was requested by Renaldo, who now very seldom exacted\nhis attendance. In his ministry about the person of the beauteous\norphan, this cunning incendiary mingled such awful regard, such melting\ncompassion, as effectually screened him from the suspicion of\ntreachery, while he widened the fatal breach between her and her lover\nby the most diabolical insinuations. He represented his friend as a\nvoluptuary, who gratified his own appetite without the least regard to\nhonour or conscience; and, with a show of infinite reluctance, imparted\nsome anecdotes of his sensuality, which he had feigned for the purpose;\nthen he would exclaim in an affected transport, “Gracious Heaven! is it\npossible for any man who has the least title to perception or humanity\nto injure such innocence and perfection! for my own part, had I been so\nundeservedly happy—Heaven and earth! forgive my transports, madam, I\ncannot help seeing and admiring such divine attractions.

The more he contemplated her character, the more difficult\nthe conquest seemed to be: he therefore altered his plan, and resolved\nto carry on his operations under the shelter of honourable proposals,\nforeseeing that a wife of her qualifications, if properly managed,\nwould turn greatly to the account of the husband, or, if her virtue\nshould prove refractory, that he could at any time rid himself of the\nencumbrance, by decamping without beat of drum, after he should be\ncloyed with possession.Elevated by these expectations, he one day, in the midst of a\npreconcerted rhapsody, importing that he could no longer conceal the\nfire that preyed upon his heart, threw himself on his knees before the\nlovely mourner, and imprinted a kiss on her fair hand. Though he did\nnot presume to take this liberty till after such preparation as he\nthought had altogether extinguished her regard for Melvil, and paved\nthe way for his own reception in room of that discarded lover, he had\nso far overshot his mark, that Monimia, instead of favouring his\ndeclaration, started up, and retired in silence, her cheeks glowing\nwith shame, and her eyes gleaming with indignation.Ferdinand no sooner recovered from the confusion produced by this\nunexpected repulse, than he saw the necessity of coming to a speedy\ndetermination, lest the offended fair one should appeal to Renaldo, in\nwhich case they might be mutually undeceived, to his utter shame and\nconfusion; he therefore resolved to deprecate her anger by humble\nsupplications, and by protesting, that, whatever tortures he might\nsuffer by suppressing his sentiments, she should never again be\noffended with a declaration of his passion.Having thus appeased the gentle Monimia, and discovered that, in spite\nof her resentment, his friend still kept possession of her heart, he\ndetermined to work an effectual separation, so as that the young lady,\nbeing utterly deserted by Melvil, should be left altogether in his\npower. With this Christian intention, he began to sadden his visage\nwith a double shade of pensive melancholy, in the presence of Renaldo,\nto stifle a succession of involuntary sighs, to answer from the\npurpose, to be incoherent in his discourse, and, in a word, to act the\npart of a person wrapt up in sorrowful cogitation."

I depend upon your friendship, and conjure\nyou, by all the ties of it, to free me at once from the most miserable\nsuspense, by owning you have involuntarily captivated the heart of that\nunhappy maiden.”To this solemn interrogation he made no reply, but shedding a flood of\ntears, of which he had always a magazine at command, he repeated his\ndesire of withdrawing, and took God to witness, that what he proposed\nwas solely for the quiet of his honoured patron and beloved friend.\n“Enough,” cried the unfortunate Renaldo, “the measure of my woes is now\nfilled up.” So saying, he fell backwards in a swoon, from which he was\nwith difficulty recovered to the sensation of the most exquisite\ntorments. During this paroxysm, our adventurer nursed him with infinite\ncare and tenderness, he exhorted him to summon all his fortitude to his\nassistance, to remember his forefathers, and exert himself in the\nimitation of their virtues, to fly from those bewitching charms which\nhad enslaved his better part, to retrieve his peace of mind by\nreflecting on the inconstancy and ingratitude of woman, and amuse his\nimagination in the pursuit of honour and glory."

He set his pride against his\nlove, he opposed his resentment to his sorrow, and his ambition to his\ndespair. Notwithstanding the balance of power so settled among these\nantagonists, so violent were the shocks of their successive conflicts,\nthat his bosom fared like a wretched province, harassed, depopulated,\nand laid waste, by two fierce contending armies. From this moment his\nlife was nothing but an alternation of starts and reveries; he wept and\nraved by turns, according to the prevailing gust of passion; food\nbecame a stranger to his lips, and sleep to his eyelids; he could not\nsupport the presence of Monimia, her absence increased the torture of\nhis pangs; and, when he met her by accident, he started back with\nhorror, like a traveller who chances to tread upon a snake.The poor afflicted orphan, worn to a shadow with self-consuming\nanguish, eager to find some lowly retreat, where she could breath out\nher soul in peace, and terrified at the frantic behaviour of Renaldo,\ncommunicated to Fathom her desire of removing, and begged that he would\ntake a small picture of her father, decorated with diamonds, and\nconvert them into money, for the expense of her subsistence. This was\nthe last pledge of her family, which she had received from her mother,\nwho had preserved it in the midst of numberless distresses, and no\nother species of misery but that which she groaned under could have\nprevailed upon the daughter to part with it; but, exclusive of other\nmotives, the very image itself, by recalling to her mind the honours of\nher name, upbraided her with living in dependence upon a man who had\ntreated her with such indignity and ingratitude; besides, she flattered\nherself with the hope that she should not long survive the loss of this\ntestimonial."

In the meantime, however, he repaired to his\nfriend Renaldo, and, after having admonished him to arm his soul with\npatience and philosophy, declared that Monimia’s guilty passion for\nhimself could no longer be kept within bounds, that she had conjured\nhim, in the most pressing manner, to assist her in escaping from an\nhouse which she considered as the worst of dungeons, because she was in\nit daily exposed to the sight and company of a man whom she detested,\nand that she had bribed him to compliance with her request, not only\nwith repeated promises of eternal love and submission, but also with\nthe picture of her father set with diamonds, which she had hitherto\nreserved as the last and greatest testimony of her affection and\nesteem.With these words he presented the fatal pledge to the eyes of the\nastonished youth, upon whom it operated like the poisonous sight of the\nbasilisk, for in an instant, the whole passions of his soul were in the\nmost violent agitation. “What!” cried he, in an ecstasy of rage, “is\nshe so abandoned to perfidy, so lost to shame, so damned to constancy,\nto gratitude, and virtuous love, as to meditate the means of leaving me\nwithout decency, without remorse! to forsake me in my adversity, when\nmy hapless fortune can no longer flatter the pride and vanity of her\nexpectation! O woman! woman! woman! what simile shall I find to\nillustrate the character of the sex? But I will not have recourse to\nvain complaints and feeble exclamations. By Heaven! she shall not\n’scape, she shall not triumph in her levity, she shall not exult in my\ndistress; no! I will rather sacrifice her to my just resentment, to the\ninjured powers of love and friendship. I will act the avenging minister\nof Heaven! I will mangle that fair bosom, which contains so false a\nheart! I will tear her to pieces, and scatter those beauteous limbs as\na prey to the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air!”"

Your endeavours to drive her from your thoughts must create an\nagony much more severe than that which divorces the soul from the body.\nNevertheless, I am so confident of your virtue and your manhood, as to\nforesee, that you will allow the fair Monimia to execute that\nresolution which she hath so unwisely taken, to withdraw herself from\nyour love and protection. Believe me, my best friend and benefactor,\nthis is a step, in consequence of which you will infallibly retrieve\nyour peace of mind. It may cost you many bitter pangs, it may probe\nyour wounds to the quick; but those pangs will be soothed by the gentle\nand salutary wing of time, and that probing will rouse you to a due\nsense of your own dignity and importance, which will enable you to\nconvert your attention to objects far more worthy of your\ncontemplation. All the hopes of happiness you had cherished in the\npossession of Monimia are now irrecoverably blasted; her heart is now\ndebased beneath your consideration; her love is, without all doubt,\nextinguished, and her honour irretrievably lost; insomuch, that, were\nshe to profess sorrow for her indiscretion, and implore your\nforgiveness, with the most solemn promises of regarding you for the\nfuture with unalterable fidelity and affection, you ought not to\nrestore her to that place in your heart which she hath so meanly\nforfeited, because you could not at the same time reinstate her in the\npossession of that delicate esteem without which there is no harmony,\nno rapture, no true enjoyment in love."

Your glory demands her dismission; the world\nwill applaud your generosity, and your own heart approve of your\nconduct. So disencumbered, let us exert ourselves once more in\npromoting your departure from this island, that you may revisit your\nfather’s house, do justice to yourself and amiable sister, and take\nvengeance on the author of your wrongs; then dedicate yourself to\nglory, in imitation of your renowned ancestors, and flourish in the\nfavour of your imperial patron.”These remonstrances had such an effect upon the Hungarian, that his\nface was lighted up with a transient gleam of satisfaction. He embraced\nFerdinand with great ardour, calling him his pride, his Mentor, his\ngood genius, and entreated him to gratify the inclination of that\nfickle creature so far as to convey her to another lodging, without\nloss of time, while he would, by absenting himself, favour their\nretreat.Our hero having obtained this permission, went immediately to the\nskirts of the town, where he had previously bespoke a small, though\nneat apartment, at the house of an old woman, widow of a French\nrefugee. He had already reconnoitred the ground, by sounding his\nlandlady, from whose poverty and complaisance he found reason to expect\nall sorts of freedom and opportunity for the accomplishment of his aim\nupon Monimia’s person. The room being prepared for her reception, he\nreturned to that disconsolate beauty, to whom he presented ten guineas,\nwhich he pretended to have raised by pledging the picture, though he\nhimself acted as the pawnbroker on this occasion, for a very plain and\nobvious reason.The fair orphan was overjoyed to find her wish so speedily\naccomplished. She forthwith packed up her necessaries in a trunk; and a\nhackney-coach was called in the dusk of the evening, in which she\nembarked with her baggage and conductor."

  "content": "Yet she did not leave the habitation of Renaldo without regret. In the\ninstant of parting, the idea of that unfortunate youth was associated\nwith every well-known object that presented itself to her eyes; not as\nan inconstant, ungenerous, and perjured swain, but as the accomplished,\nthe virtuous, the melting lover, who had captivated her virgin heart.\nAs Fathom led her to the door, she was met by Renaldo’s dog, which had\nlong been her favourite; and the poor animal fawning upon her as she\npassed, her heart was overwhelmed with such a gush of tenderness, that\na flood of tears streamed down her cheeks, and she had well-nigh sunk\nupon the floor.Ferdinand, considering this emotion as the last tribute she would pay\nto Renaldo, hurried her into the coach, where she soon recovered her\ncomposure; and in a little time he ushered her into the house of Madam\nla Mer, by whom she was received with great cordiality, and conducted\nto her apartment, with which she found no other fault than that of its\nbeing too good for one in her forlorn situation. Here, while the tear\nof gratitude started in either eye, she thanked our adventurer for his\nbenevolence and kind concern, assuring him, that she would not fail\nduly to beseech the Most High to shower down blessings upon him, as the\norphan’s friend and protector.Fathom was not deficient in those expressions that were best adapted to\nher present turn of mind. He observed, that what he had done was in\nobedience to the dictates of common humanity, which would have prompted\nhim to assist any fellow-creature in distress; but that her peculiar\nvirtue and qualifications were such as challenged the utmost exertion\nof his faculties in her service. He said, that surely Heaven had not\ncreated such perfection in vain; that she was destined to receive as\nwell as to communicate happiness; and that the Providence, which she so\npiously adored, would not fail, in due season, to raise her from\ndistress and affliction, to that honour and felicity for which she was\ncertainly ordained. In the meantime, he entreated her to depend upon\nhis service and fidelity, and the article of her board being settled,\nhe left her to the company and consolation of her discreet hostess, who\nsoon insinuated herself into the good opinion of her beauteous lodger."

  "content": "While our hero was employed in this transaction, Renaldo sallied forth\nin a sort of intoxication, which Fathom’s admonitions had inspired;\nand, repairing to a certain noted coffee-house, engaged at chess with\nan old French refugee, that his attention, by being otherwise employed,\nmight not stray towards that fatal object which he ardently wished to\nforget. But, unluckily for him, he had scarce performed three moves of\nthe game, when his ears were exposed to a dialogue between two young\ngentlemen, one of whom asked the other if he would go and see the\n“Orphan” acted at one of the theatres; observing, as a farther\ninducement, that the part of Monimia would be performed by a young\ngentlewoman who had never appeared on the stage. At mention of that\nname, Renaldo started; for though it did not properly belong to his\norphan, it was the appellation by which she had been distinguished ever\nsince her separation from her father’s house, and therefore it recalled\nher to his imagination in the most interesting point of view. Though he\nendeavoured to expel the image, by a closer application to his play,\nevery now and then it intruded upon his fancy, and at each return made\na stronger impression; so that he found himself in the situation of an\nunfortunate bark stranded upon some hidden rock, which, when the wind\nbegins to blow, feels every succeeding wave more boisterous than the\nformer, until, with irresistible fury, they surmount her deck, sweep\neverything before them, and dash her all to pieces.The refugee had observed his first emotion, which he attributed to an\nunforeseen advantage he himself had gained over the Hungarian; but\nseeing him, in the sequel, bite his lip, roll his eyes, groan, writhe\nhis body, ejaculate incoherent curses, and neglect his game, the\nHuguenot concluded that he was mad, and being seized with terror and\ndismay, got up and scampered off, without ceremony or hesitation.Melvil, thus left to the horrors of his own thought, which tortured him\nwith the apprehension of losing Monimia for ever, could no longer\ncombat that suggestion, but ran homewards with all the speed he could\nexert, in order to prevent her retreat. When he crossed the threshold,\nhe was struck with such a damp of presaging fear, that he durst not in\nperson approach her apartment, nor even, by questioning the servant,\ninform himself of the particulars he wanted to know. Yet his suspense\nbecoming more insupportable than his fear, he rushed from room to room\nin quest of that which was not to be found; and, seeing Monimia’s\nchamber door open, entered the deserted temple in a state of\ndistraction, calling aloud upon her name. All was silent, solitary, and\nwoful. “She is gone,” he cried, shedding a flood of tears, “she is for\never lost; and all my hopes of happiness are fled!”So saying, he sunk upon that couch on which Monimia had oft reposed,\nand abandoned himself to all the excess of grief and despondence. In\nthis deplorable condition he was found by our adventurer, who gently\nchid him for his want of resolution, and again repelled his sorrow, by\narousing his resentment against the innocent cause of his disquiet,\nhaving beforehand forged the particulars of provocation."
