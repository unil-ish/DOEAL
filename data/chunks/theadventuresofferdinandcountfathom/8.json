This phenomenon made\nsuch an impression upon the astonished chevalier, already discomposed\nby the resolute behaviour of the Count, that he became jaundiced with\nterror and dismay, and, while his teeth chattered in his head, told our\nhero he had hoped, from his known politeness, to have found him ready\nto acknowledge an injury which might have been the effect of anger or\nmisapprehension, in which case the affair might have been compromised\nto their mutual satisfaction, without proceeding to those extremities\nwhich, among men of honour, are always accounted the last resource. To\nthis representation Ferdinand answered, that the affair had been of the\nchevalier’s own seeking, inasmuch as he had intruded himself into his\ncompany, and treated him with the most insolent and unprovoked abuse,\nwhich plainly flowed from a premeditated design against his honour and\nreputation; he, therefore, far from being disposed to own himself in\nthe wrong, would not even accept of a public acknowledgment from him,\nthe aggressor, whom he looked upon as an infamous sharper, and was\nresolved to chastise accordingly.Here the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a person who\nwas brought to the door in a chair, and conducted into another\napartment, from which a message was brought to the Count, importing,\nthat the stranger desired to speak with him upon business of the last\nimportance. Fathom having chid the servant for admitting people without\nhis order, desired the Swiss to excuse him for a minute longer, and\nwent in to the next room, from whence the following dialogue was\noverheard by this challenger:—“Count,” said the stranger, “you are not\nignorant of my pretensions to the heart of that young lady, at whose\nhouse I met you yesterday; therefore you cannot be surprised when I\ndeclare myself displeased with your visits and behaviour to my\nmistress, and demand that you will instantly promise to drop the\ncorrespondence.” “Else what follows?” answered Ferdinand, with a cool\nand temperate voice. “My resentment and immediate defiance,” replied\nthe other; “for the only alternative I propose is, to forego your\ndesign upon that lady, or to decide our pretension by the sword.”"

  "content": "Our hero, having expressed a regard for this visitant as the son of a\ngentleman whom he honoured, was at the pains to represent the\nunreasonableness of his demand, and the folly of his presumption; and\nearnestly exhorted him to put the issue of his cause upon a more safe\nand equitable footing. But this admonition, instead of appeasing the\nwrath, seemed to inflame the resentment of the opponent, who swore he\nwould not leave him until he should have accomplished the purport of\nhis errand. In vain our adventurer requested half an hour for the\ndespatch of some urgent business, in which he was engaged with a\ngentleman in the other parlour. This impetuous rival rejected all the\nterms he could propose, and even challenged him to decide the\ncontroversy upon the spot; an expedient to which the other having\nassented with reluctance, the door was secured, the swords unsheathed,\nand a hot engagement ensued, to the inexpressible pleasure of the\nSwiss, who did not doubt that he himself would be screened from all\ndanger by the event of this rencontre. Nevertheless, his hope was\ndisappointed in the defeat of the stranger, who was quickly disarmed,\nin consequence of a wound through the sword-arm; upon which occasion\nFathom was heard to say, that, in consideration of his youth and\nfamily, he had spared his life; but he would not act with the same\ntenderness towards any other antagonist. He then bound up the limb he\nhad disabled, conducted the vanquished party to his chair, rejoined the\nchevalier with a serene countenance, and, asking pardon for having\ndetained him so long, proposed they should instantly set out in a\nhackney-coach for the place of appointment.The stratagem thus conducted, had all the success the inventor could\ndesire. The fear of the Swiss had risen almost to an ecstasy before the\nCount quitted the room; but after this sham battle, which had been\npreconcerted betwixt our adventurer and his friend Ratchcali, the\nchevalier’s terrors were unspeakable. He considered Fathom as a devil\nincarnate, and went into the coach as a malefactor bound for Tyburn. He\nwould have gladly compounded for the loss of a leg or arm, and\nentertained some transient gleams of hope, that he should escape for\nhalf a dozen flesh-wounds, which he would have willingly received as\nthe price of his presumption; but these hopes were banished by the\nremembrance of that dreadful declaration which he had heard the Count\nmake, after having overcome his last adversary; and he continued under\nthe power of the most unsupportable panic, until the carriage halted at\nHyde Park Corner, where he crawled forth in a most piteous and\nlamentable condition; so that, when they reached the spot, he was\nscarce able to stand.Here he made an effort to speak, and propose an accommodation upon a\nnew plan, by which he promised to leave his cause to the arbitrement of\nthose gentlemen who were present at the rupture, and to ask pardon of\nthe Count, provided he should be found guilty of a trespass upon good\nmanners; but this proposal would not satisfy the implacable Ferdinand,\nwho, perceiving the agony of the Swiss, resolved to make the most of\nthe adventure, and giving him to understand he was not a man to be\ntrifled with, desired him to draw without further preamble. Thus\ncompelled, the unfortunate gamester pulled off his coat, and, putting\nhimself in a posture, to use the words of Nym, “winked, and held out\nhis cold iron.”"

  "content": "Our adventurer, far from making a gentle use of the advantages he\npossessed, fiercely attacked him, while he was incapable of making\nresistance, and, aiming at a fleshy part, ran him through the arm and\noutside of the shoulder at the very first pass. The chevalier, already\nstupefied with the horror of expectation, no sooner felt his\nadversary’s point in his body than he fell to the ground, and,\nconcluding he was no longer a man for this world, began to cross\nhimself with great devotion; while Fathom walked home deliberately, and\nin his way sent a couple of chairmen to the assistance of the wounded\nknight.This achievement, which could not be concealed from the knowledge of\nthe public, not only furnished the character of Fathom with fresh\nwreaths of admiration and applause, but likewise effectually secured\nhim from any future attempts of his enemies, to whom the Swiss, for his\nown sake, had communicated such terrible ideas of his valour, as\noverawed the whole community.CHAPTER THIRTY-FOURHE PERFORMS ANOTHER EXPLOIT, THAT CONVEYS A TRUE IDEA OF HIS GRATITUDE\nAND HONOUR.It was not long after this celebrated victory, that he was invited to\nspend part of the summer at the house of a country gentleman, who lived\nabout one hundred miles from London, possessed of a very opulent\nfortune, the greatest part of which was expended in acts of old English\nhospitality. He had met with our hero by accident at the table of a\ncertain great man, and was so struck with his manner and conversation,\nas to desire his acquaintance, and cultivate his friendship; and he\nthought himself extremely happy in having prevailed upon him to pass a\nfew weeks in his family."

  "content": "Fathom, among his other observations, perceived that there was a\ndomestic uneasiness, occasioned by a very beautiful young creature\nabout the age of fifteen, who resided in the house under the title of\nthe gentleman’s niece, though she was in reality his natural daughter,\nborn before his marriage. This circumstance was not unknown to his\nlady, by whose express approbation he had bestowed particular attention\nupon the education of the child, whom we shall distinguish by the name\nof Celinda. Their liberality in this particular had not been\nmisapplied; for she not only gave marks of uncommon capacity, but, as\nshe grew up, became more and more amiable in her person, and was now\nreturned from the boarding school, possessed of every accomplishment\nthat could be acquired by one of her age and opportunities. These\nqualifications, which endeared her to every other person, excited the\njealousy and displeasure of her supposed aunt, who could not bear to\nsee her own children eclipsed by this illegitimate daughter, whom she\ntherefore discountenanced upon all occasions, and exposed to such\nmortifications as would in all appearance drive her from her father’s\nhouse. This persecuting spirit was very disagreeable to the husband,\nwho loved Celinda with a truly paternal affection, and produced\nabundance of family disquiet; but being a man of a peaceable and\nyielding disposition, he could not long maintain the resolution he had\ntaken in her favour, and therefore he ceased opposing the malevolence\nof his wife.In this unfortunate predicament stood the fair bastard, at the arrival\nof our adventurer, who, being allured by her charms, apprised of her\nsituation at the same time, took the generous resolution to undermine\nher innocence, that he might banquet his vicious appetite with the\nspoils of her beauty. Perhaps such a brutal design might not have\nentered his imagination, if he had not observed, in the disposition of\nthis hapless maiden, certain peculiarities from which he derived the\nmost confident presages of success. Besides a total want of experience,\nthat left her open and unguarded against the attacks of the other sex,\nshe discovered a remarkable spirit of credulity and superstitious fear,\nwhich had been cherished by the conversation of her school-fellows. She\nwas particularly fond of music, in which she had made some progress;\nbut so delicate was the texture of her nerves, that one day, while\nFathom entertained the company with a favourite air, she actually\nswooned with pleasure."

  "content": "Such sensibility, our projector well knew, must be diffused through all\nthe passions of her heart; he congratulated himself upon the sure\nascendency he had gained over her in this particular; and forthwith\nbegan to execute the plan he had erected for her destruction. That he\nmight the more effectually deceive the vigilance of her father’s wife,\nhe threw such a dash of affectation in his complaisance towards\nCelinda, as could not escape the notice of that prying matron, though\nit was not palpable enough to disoblige the young lady herself, who\ncould not so well distinguish between overstrained courtesy and real\ngood breeding. This behaviour screened him from the suspicion of the\nfamily, who considered it as an effort of politeness, to cover his\nindifference and disgust for the daughter of his friend, who had by\nthis time given some reason to believe she looked upon him with the\neyes of affection; so that the opportunities he enjoyed of conversing\nwith her in private, were less liable to intrusion or inquiry. Indeed,\nfrom what I have already observed, touching the sentiments of her\nstepdame, that lady, far from taking measures for thwarting our hero’s\ndesign, would have rejoiced at the execution of it, and, had she been\ninformed of his intent, might have fallen upon some method to\nfacilitate the enterprise; but, as he solely depended upon his own\ntalents, he never dreamed of soliciting such an auxiliary.Under cover of instructing and accomplishing her in the exercise of\nmusic, he could not want occasions for promoting his aim; when, after\nhaving soothed her sense of hearing, even to a degree of ravishment, so\nas to extort from her an exclamation, importing, that he was surely\nsomething supernatural! he never failed to whisper some insidious\ncompliment or tale of love, exquisitely suited to the emotions of her\nsoul. Thus was her heart insensibly subdued; though more than half his\nwork was still undone; for, at all times, she disclosed such purity of\nsentiment, such inviolable attachment to religion and virtue, and\nseemed so averse to all sorts of inflammatory discourse, that he durst\nnot presume upon the footing he had gained in her affection, to explain\nthe baseness of his desire; he therefore applied to another of her\npassions, that proved the bane of her virtue. This was her timidity,\nwhich at first being constitutional, was afterwards increased by the\ncircumstances of her education, and now aggravated by the artful\nconversation of Fathom, which he chequered with dismal stories of\nomens, portents, prophecies, and apparitions, delivered upon such\nunquestionable testimony, and with such marks of conviction, as\ncaptivated the belief of the devoted Celinda, and filled her\nimagination with unceasing terrors."

The more she endeavoured to banish\nthem, the more troublesome they became; and such was her infatuation,\nthat as her terrors increased, her thirst after that sort of knowledge\nwas augmented. Many sleepless nights did she pass amidst those horrors\nof fancy, starting at every noise, and sweating with dreary\napprehension, yet ashamed to own her fears, or solicit the comfort of a\nbedfellow, lest she should incur the ridicule and censure of her\nfather’s wife; and what rendered this disposition the more irksome, was\nthe solitary situation of her chamber, that stood at the end of a long\ngallery scarce within hearing of any other inhabited part of the house.All these circumstances had been duly weighed by our projector, who,\nhaving prepared Celinda for his purpose, stole at midnight from his\napartment, which was in another storey, and approaching her door, there\nuttered a piteous groan; then softly retired to his bed, in full\nconfidence of seeing next day the effect of this operation. Nor did his\narrow miss the mark. Poor Celinda’s countenance gave such indications\nof melancholy and dismay, that he could not omit asking the cause of\nher disquiet, and she, at his earnest request, was prevailed upon to\ncommunicate the dreadful salutation of the preceding night, which she\nconsidered as an omen of death to some person of the family, in all\nprobability to herself, as the groan seemed to issue from one corner of\nher own apartment. Our adventurer argued against this supposition, as\ncontradictory to the common observation of those supernatural warnings\nwhich are not usually imparted to the person who is doomed to die, but\nto some faithful friend, or trusty servant, particularly interested in\nthe event. He therefore supposed, that the groans foreboded the death\nof my lady, who seemed to be in a drooping state of health, and were,\nby her genius, conveyed to the organs of Celinda, who was the chief\nsufferer by her jealous and barbarous disposition; he likewise\nexpressed an earnest desire to be an ear-witness of such solemn\ncommunication, and, alleging that it was highly improper for a young\nlady of her delicate feelings to expose herself alone to such another\ndismal visitation, begged he might be allowed to watch all night in her\nchamber, in order to defend her from the shocking impressions of fear."

Not that she thought her\ninnocence or reputation could suffer by her compliance with his\nrequest; for, hitherto, her heart was a stranger to those young desires\nwhich haunt the fancy, and warm the breast of youth; so that, being\nignorant of her danger, she saw not the necessity of avoiding\ntemptation; but she refused to admit a man into her bedchamber, merely\nbecause it was a step altogether opposite to the forms and decorum of\nlife. Nevertheless, far from being discouraged by this repulse, he knew\nher fears would multiply and reduce that reluctance, which, in order to\nweaken, he had recourse to another piece of machinery, that operated\npowerfully in behalf of his design.Some years ago, a twelve-stringed instrument was contrived by a very\ningenious musician, by whom it was aptly entitled the “Harp of Aeolus,”\nbecause, being properly applied to a stream of air, it produces a wild\nirregular variety of harmonious sounds, that seem to be the effect of\nenchantment, and wonderfully dispose the mind for the most romantic\nsituations. Fathom, who was really a virtuoso in music, had brought one\nof those new-fashioned guitars into the country, and as the effect of\nit was still unknown in the family, he that night converted it to the\npurposes of his amour, by fixing it in the casement of a window\nbelonging to the gallery, exposed to the west wind, which then blew in\na gentle breeze. The strings no sooner felt the impression of the balmy\nzephyr, than they began to pour forth a stream of melody more\nravishingly delightful than the song of Philomel, the warbling brook,\nand all the concert of the wood. The soft and tender notes of peace and\nlove were swelled up with the most delicate and insensible transition\ninto a loud hymn of triumph and exultation, joined by the deep-toned\norgan, and a full choir of voices, which gradually decayed upon the\near, until it died away in distant sound, as if a flight of angels had\nraised the song in their ascent to heaven. Yet the chords hardly ceased\nto vibrate after the expiration of this overture, which ushered in a\ncomposition in the same pathetic style; and this again was succeeded by\na third, almost without pause or intermission, as if the artist’s hand\nhad been indefatigable, and the theme never to be exhausted."

She was\noverwhelmed with awful terror, and, never doubting that the sounds were\nmore than mortal, recommended herself to the care of Providence in a\nsuccession of pious ejaculations.Our adventurer, having allowed some time for the effect of this\ncontrivance, repaired to her chamber door, and, in a whisper, conveyed\nthrough the keyhole, asked if she was awake, begged pardon for such an\nunseasonable visit, and desired to know her opinion of the strange\nmusic which he then heard. In spite of her notions of decency, she was\nglad of his intrusion, and, being in no condition to observe\npunctilios, slipped on a wrapper, opened the door, and, with a\nfaltering voice, owned herself frightened almost to distraction. He\npretended to console her with reflections, importing, that she was in\nthe hands of a benevolent Being, who would not impose upon his\ncreatures any task which they could not bear; he insisted upon her\nreturning to bed, and assured her he would not stir from her chamber\ntill day. Thus comforted, she betook herself again to rest, while he\nsat down in an elbow-chair at some distance from the bedside, and, in a\nsoft voice, began the conversation with her on the subject of those\nvisitations from above, which, though undertaken on pretence of\ndissipating her fear and anxiety, was, in reality, calculated for the\npurpose of augmenting both.“That sweet air,” said he, “seems designed for soothing the bodily\nanguish of some saint in his last moments. Hark! how it rises into a\nmore sprightly and elevated strain, as if it were an inspiriting\ninvitation to the realms of bliss! Sure, he is now absolved from all\nthe misery of this life! That full and glorious concert of voices and\ncelestial harps betoken his reception among the heavenly choir, who now\nwaft his soul to paradisian joys! This is altogether great, solemn, and\namazing! The clock strikes one, the symphony hath ceased!”"

As for poor\nCelinda, her fancy was, by his music and discourse, worked up to the\nhighest pitch of enthusiastic terrors; the whole bed shook with her\ntrepidation, the awful silence that succeeded the supernatural music\nthrew an additional damp upon her spirits, and the artful Fathom\naffecting to snore at the same time, she could no longer contain her\nhorror, but called upon his name with a fearful accent, and, having\nowned her present situation insupportable, entreated him to draw near\nher bedside, that he might be within touch on any emergency.This was a welcome request to our adventurer, who, asking pardon for\nhis drowsiness, and taking his station on the side of her bed, exhorted\nher to compose herself; then locking her hand fast in his own, was\nagain seized with such an inclination to sleep, that he gradually sunk\ndown by her side, and seemed to enjoy his repose in that attitude.\nMeanwhile, his tender-hearted mistress, that he might not suffer in his\nhealth by his humanity and complaisance, covered him with the\ncounterpane as he slept, and suffered him to take his rest without\ninterruption, till he thought proper to start up suddenly with an\nexclamation of, “Heaven watch over us!” and then asked, with symptoms\nof astonishment, if she had heard nothing. Such an abrupt address upon\nsuch an occasion, did not fail to amaze and affright the gentle\nCelinda, who, unable to speak, sprung towards her treacherous\nprotector; and he, catching her in his arms, bade her fear nothing, for\nhe would, at the expense of his life, defend her from all danger.Having thus, by tampering with her weakness, conquered the first and\nchief obstacles to his design, he, with great art and perseverance,\nimproved the intercourse to such a degree of intimacy, as could not but\nbe productive of all the consequences which he had foreseen. The groans\nand music were occasionally repeated, so as to alarm the whole family,\nand inspire a thousand various conjectures. He failed not to continue\nhis nocturnal visits and ghastly discourse, until his attendance became\nso necessary to this unhappy maiden, that she durst not stay in her own\nchamber without his company, nor even sleep, except in contact with her\nbetrayer."

In her paroxysms of dismay, he did not\nforget to breathe the soft inspirations of his passion, to which she\nlistened with more pleasure, as they diverted the gloomy ideas of her\nfear; and by this time his extraordinary accomplishments had made a\nconquest of her heart. What therefore could be a more interesting\ntransition than that from the most uneasy to the most agreeable\nsensation of the human breast?This being the case, the reader will not wonder that a consummate\ntraitor, like Fathom, should triumph over the virtue of an artless,\ninnocent young creature, whose passions he had entirely under his\ncommand. The gradations towards vice are almost imperceptible, and an\nexperienced seducer can strew them with such enticing and agreeable\nflowers, as will lead the young sinner on insensibly, even to the most\nprofligate stages of guilt. All therefore that can be done by virtue,\nunassisted with experience, is to avoid every trial with such a\nformidable foe, by declining and discouraging the first advances\ntowards a particular correspondence with perfidious man, howsoever\nagreeable it may seem to be. For here is no security but in conscious\nweakness.Fathom, though possessed of the spoils of poor Celinda’s honour, did\nnot enjoy his success with tranquillity. Reflection and remorse often\ninvaded her in the midst of their guilty pleasures, and embittered all\nthose moments they had dedicated to mutual bliss. For the seeds of\nvirtue are seldom destroyed at once. Even amidst the rank productions\nof vice, they regerminate to a sort of imperfect vegetation, like some\nscattered hyacinths shooting up among the weeds of a ruined garden,\nthat testify the former culture and amenity of the soil. She sighed at\nthe sad remembrance of that virgin dignity which she had lost; she wept\nat the prospect of that disgrace, mortification, and misery she should\nundergo, when abandoned by this transient lover, and severely\nreproached him for the arts he had used to shipwreck her innocence and\npeace."

But, as\nhe had measures to keep with a family of such consequence, he\nconstrained his inclinations, so far as to counterfeit those raptures\nhe no longer felt, and found means to appease those intervening tumults\nof her grief.Foreseeing, however, that it would not be always in his power to\nconsole her on these terms, he resolved, if possible, to divide her\naffection, which now glowed upon him too intensely; and, with that\nview, whenever she complained of the vapours or dejection, he\nprescribed, and even insisted upon her swallowing certain cordials of\nthe most palatable composition, without which he never travelled; and\nthese produced such agreeable reveries and flow of spirits, that she\ngradually became enamoured of intoxication; while he encouraged the\npernicious passion, by expressing the most extravagant applause and\nadmiration at the wild irregular sallies it produced.

What contributed to the\naggrandisement of his character in this branch of knowledge, was a\nvictory he obtained over an old physician, who plied at the well, and\nhad one day unfortunately begun to harangue in the pump-room upon the\nnature of the Bristol water. In the course of this lecture he undertook\nto account for the warmth of the fluid; and his ideas being perplexed\nwith a great deal of reading, which he had not been able to digest, his\ndisquisition was so indistinct, and his expression so obscure and\nunentertaining, that our hero seized the opportunity of displaying his\nown erudition, by venturing to contradict some circumstances of the\ndoctor’s hypothesis, and substituting a theory of his own, which, as he\nhad invented it for the purpose, was equally amusing and chimerical.He alleged, that fire was the sole vivifying principle that pervaded\nall nature; that, as the heat of the sun concocted the juice of\nvegetables, and ripened those fruits that grow upon the surface of this\nglobe, there was likewise an immense store of central fire reserved\nwithin the bowels of the earth, not only for the generation of gems,\nfossils, and all the purposes of the mineral world, but likewise for\ncherishing and keeping alive those plants which would otherwise perish\nby the winter’s cold. The existence of such a fire he proved from the\nnature of all those volcanoes, which in almost every corner of the\nearth are continually vomiting up either flames or smoke. “These,” said\nhe, “are the great vents appointed by nature for the discharge of that\nrarefied air and combustible matter, which, if confined, would burst\nthe globe asunder; but, besides the larger outlets, there are some\nsmall chimneys through which part of the heat transpires; a vapour of\nthat sort, I conceive, must pass through the bed or channel of this\nspring, the waters of which, accordingly retain a moderate warmth.”"

This\ndeclaration introduced a dispute, which was unanimously determined in\nfavour of our adventurer. On all such occasions the stream of prejudice\nruns against the physician, even though his antagonist has nothing to\nrecommend himself to the favour of the spectators; and this decision\ndepends upon divers considerations. In the first place, there is a\ncontinual war carried on against the learned professions, by all those\nwho, conscious of their own ignorance, seek to level the reputation of\ntheir superiors with their own. Secondly, in all disputes upon physic\nthat happen betwixt a person who really understands the art, and an\nilliterate pretender, the arguments of the first will seem obscure and\nunintelligible to those who are unacquainted with the previous systems\non which they are built; while the other’s theory, derived from common\nnotions, and superficial observation, will be more agreeable, because\nbetter adapted to the comprehension of the hearers. Thirdly, the\njudgment of the multitude is apt to be biassed by that surprise which\nis the effect of seeing an artist foiled at his own weapons, by one who\nengages him only for amusement.Fathom, besides these advantages, was blessed with a flow of language,\nan elegant address, a polite and self-denying style of argumentation,\ntogether with a temper not to be ruffled; so that the victory could not\nlong waver between him and the physician, to whom he was infinitely\nsuperior in every acquisition but that of solid learning, of which the\njudges had no idea. This contest was not only glorious but profitable\nto our adventurer, who grew into such request in his medical capacity,\nthat the poor doctor was utterly deserted by his patients, and Fathom’s\nadvice solicited by every valetudinarian in the place; nor did he\nforfeit the character he thus acquired by any miscarriages in his\npractice. Being but little conversant with the materia medica, the\ncircle of his prescriptions was very small; his chief study was to\navoid all drugs of rough operation and uncertain effect, and to\nadminister such only as should be agreeable to the palate, without\ndoing violence to the constitution. Such a physician could not but be\nagreeable to people of all dispositions; and, as most of the patients\nwere in some shape hypochondriac, the power of imagination,\nco-operating with his remedies, often effected a cure."

But empty fame\nwas not the sole fruit of his success. Though no person would presume\nto affront this noble graduate with a fee, they did not fail to\nmanifest their gratitude by some more valuable present. Every day some\nsuperb piece of china, curious snuffbox, or jewel, was pressed upon\nhim; so that, at the end of the season, he could almost have furnished\na toyshop with the acknowledgments he had received. Not only his\navarice, but his pleasure, was gratified in the course of his medical\nadministration. He enjoyed free access, egress, and regress with all\nthe females at the well, and no matron scrupled to put her daughter\nunder his care and direction. These opportunities could not be lost\nupon a man of his intriguing genius; though he conducted his amours\nwith such discretion, that, during the whole season, no lady’s\ncharacter suffered on his account, yet he was highly fortunate in his\naddresses, and we may venture to affirm, that the reproach of\nbarrenness was more than once removed by the vigour of his endeavours.CHAPTER THIRTY-SIXHE IS SMITTEN WITH THE CHARMS OF A FEMALE ADVENTURER, WHOSE ALLUREMENTS\nSUBJECT HIM TO A NEW VICISSITUDE OF FORTUNE.Among those who were distinguished by his gallantry was the young wife\nof an old citizen of London, who had granted her permission to reside\nat the hot well for the benefit of her health, under the eye and\ninspection of his own sister, who was a maiden of fifty years. The\npupil, whose name was Mrs. Trapwell, though low in stature, was finely\nshaped, her countenance engaging, though her complexion was brown, her\nhair in colour rivalled the raven’s back, and her eyes emulated the\nlustre of the diamond. Fathom had been struck with her first\nappearance; but found it impracticable to elude the vigilance of her\nduenna, so as to make a declaration of his flame; until she herself,\nguessing the situation of his thoughts, and not displeased with the\ndiscovery, thought proper to furnish him with the opportunity he\nwanted, by counterfeiting an indisposition, for the cure of which she\nknew his advice would be implored. This was the beginning of an\nacquaintance, which was soon improved to his wish; and so well did she\nmanage her attractions, as in some measure to fix the inconstancy of\nhis disposition; for, at the end of the season, his passion was not\nsated; and they concerted the means of continuing their commerce, even\nafter their return to London."

Conscious of her own\nprecarious situation, she had resolved to impose upon the infirmities\nof Trapwell, and, feigning herself pregnant, gave him to understand she\ncould no longer conceal her condition from the knowledge of her\nbrother, who was an officer in the army, and of such violent passions,\nthat, should he once discover her backsliding, he would undoubtedly\nwipe away the stains of his family dishonour with her own blood, as\nwell as that of her keeper. The citizen, to prevent such a catastrophe,\ntook her to wife; but soon after perceiving the trick which had been\nplayed upon him, set his invention at work, and at length contrived a\nscheme which he thought would enable him, not only to retrieve his\nliberty, but also indemnify himself for the mortification he had\nundergone.Far from creating any domestic disturbance, by upbraiding her with her\nfinesse, he seemed perfectly well pleased with his acquisition; and, as\nhe knew her void of any principle, and extremely addicted to pleasure,\nhe chose proper occasions to insinuate, that she might gratify her own\ninclination, and at the same time turn her beauty to good account. She\njoyfully listened to these remonstrances, and, in consequence of their\nmutual agreement, she repaired to Bristol Spring, on pretence of an ill\nstate of health, accompanied by her sister-in-law, whom they did not\nthink proper to intrust with the real motive of her journey. Fathom’s\nperson was agreeable, and his finances supposed to be in flourishing\norder; therefore, she selected him from the herd of gallants, as a\nproper sacrifice to the powers which she adored; and, on her arrival in\nLondon, made her husband acquainted with the importance of her\nconquest.Trapwell overwhelmed her with caresses and praise for her discreet and\ndutiful conduct, and faithfully promised that she should pocket in her\nown privy purse one-half of the spoils that should be gathered from her\ngallant, whom she therefore undertook to betray, after he had swore, in\nthe most solemn manner, that his intention was not to bring the affair\nto a public trial, which would redound to his own disgrace, but to\nextort a round sum of money from the Count, by way of composition.\nConfiding in this protestation, she in a few days gave him intelligence\nof an assignation she had made with our adventurer, at a certain bagnio\nnear Covent Garden; upon which he secured the assistance of a\nparticular friend and his own journeyman, with whom, and a constable,\nhe repaired to the place of rendezvous, where he waited in an adjoining\nroom, according to the directions of his virtuous spouse, until she\nmade the preconcerted signal of hemming three times aloud, when he and\nhis associates rushed into the chamber and surprised our hero in bed\nwith his inamorata."

As for Fathom, his affliction was unutterable, when he found\nhimself discovered in that situation, and made prisoner by the two\nassistants, who had pinioned him in such a manner, that he could not\nstir, much less accomplish an escape. All his ingenuity and presence of\nmind seemed to forsake him in this emergency. The horrors of an English\njury overspread his imagination; for he at once perceived that the toil\ninto which he had fallen was laid for the purpose; consequently he took\nit for granted that there would be no deficiency in point of evidence.\nSoon as he recollected himself, he begged that no violence might be\noffered to his person, and entreated the husband to favour him with a\nconference, in which the affair might be compromised, without prejudice\nto the reputation of either.At first Trapwell breathed nothing but implacable revenge, but, by the\npersuasion of his friends, after he had sent home his wife in a chair,\nhe was prevailed upon to hear the proposals of the delinquent, who\nhaving assured him, by way of apology, that he had always believed the\nlady was a widow, made him an offer of five hundred pounds, as an\natonement for the injury he had sustained. This being a sum no ways\nadequate to the expectation of the citizen, who looked upon the Count\nas possessor of an immense estate, he rejected the terms with disdain,\nand made instant application to a judge, from whom he obtained a\nwarrant for securing his person till the day of trial. Indeed, in this\ncase, money was but a secondary consideration with Trapwell, whose\nchief aim was to be legally divorced from a woman he detested.\nTherefore there was no remedy for the unhappy Count, who in vain\noffered to double the sum. He found himself reduced to the bitter\nalternative of procuring immediate bail, or going directly to Newgate.In this dilemma he sent a messenger to his friend Ratchcali, whose\ncountenance fell when he understood the Count’s condition; nor would he\nopen his mouth in the style of consolation, until he had consulted a\ncertain solicitor of his acquaintance, who assured him the law abounded\nwith such resources as would infallibly screen the defendant, had the\nfact been still more palpable than it was. He said there was great\npresumption to believe the Count had fallen a sacrifice to a\nconspiracy, which by some means or other would be detected; and, in\nthat case, the plaintiff might obtain one shilling in lieu of damages.\nIf that dependence should fail, he hinted that, in all probability, the\nwitnesses were not incorruptible; or, should they prove to be so, one\nman’s oath was as good as another’s; and, thank Heaven, there was no\ndearth of evidence, provided money could be found to answer the\nnecessary occasions."

Not but\nthat the Tyrolese knew Ferdinand too well to confide in his parole. He\ndepended chiefly upon his ideas of self-interest, which, he thought,\nwould persuade him to risk the uncertain issue of a trial, rather than\nquit the field before the harvest was half over; and he was resolved to\nmake his own retreat without ceremony, should our hero be unwise enough\nto abandon his bail.Such an adventure could not long lie concealed from the notice of the\npublic, even if both parties had been at pains to suppress the\ncircumstances. But the plaintiff, far from seeking to cover, affected\nto complain loudly of his misfortune, that he might interest his\nneighbours in his behalf, and raise a spirit of rancour and animosity,\nto influence the jury against this insolent foreigner, who had come\nover into England to debauch our wives and deflower our daughters;\nwhile he employed a formidable band of lawyers to support the\nindictment, which he laid at ten thousand pounds damages.Meanwhile, Fathom and his associate did not fail to take all proper\nmeasures for his defence; they retained a powerful bar of counsel, and\nthe solicitor was supplied with one hundred pounds after another, to\nanswer the expense of secret service; still assuring his clients that\neverything was in an excellent train, and that his adversary would gain\nnothing but shame and confusion of face. Nevertheless, there was a\nnecessity for postponing the trial, on account of a material evidence,\nwho, though he wavered, was not yet quite brought over; and the\nattorney found means to put off the decision from term to term, until\nthere was no quibble left for further delay. While this suit was\ndepending, our hero continued to move in his usual sphere; nor did the\nreport of his situation at all operate to his disadvantage in the\npolite world; on the contrary, it added a fresh plume to his character,\nin the eyes of all those who were not before acquainted with the\ntriumphs of his gallantry. Notwithstanding this countenance of his\nfriends, he himself considered the affair in a very serious light; and\nperceiving that, at any rate, he must be a considerable loser, he\nresolved to double his assiduity in trade, that he might be the more\nable to afford the extraordinary expense to which he was subjected.CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENFRESH CAUSE FOR EXERTING HIS EQUANIMITY AND FORTITUDE."

  "content": "The reader may have observed, that Fathom, with all his circumspection,\nhad a weak side, which exposed him to sundry mischances; this was his\ncovetousness, which on some occasions became too hard for his\ndiscretion. At this period of time it was, by the circumstances of his\nsituation, inflamed to a degree of rapacity. He was now prevailed upon\nto take a hand at whist or piquet, and even to wield the hazard-box;\nthough he had hitherto declared himself an irreconcilable enemy to all\nsorts of play; and so uncommon was his success and dexterity at these\nexercises, as to surprise his acquaintance, and arouse the suspicion of\nsome people, who repined at his prosperity.But in nothing was his conduct more inexcusable than in giving way to\nthe dangerous temerity of Ratchcali, which he had been always at pains\nto restrain, and permitting him to practise the same fraud upon an\nEnglish nobleman, which had been executed upon himself at Frankfort. In\nother words, the Tyrolese, by the canal of Ferdinand’s finger and\nrecommendation, sold a pebble for a real brilliant, and in a few days\nthe cheat was discovered, to the infinite confusion of our adventurer,\nwho nevertheless assumed the guise of innocence with so much art, and\nexpressed such indignation against the villain who had imposed upon his\njudgment and unsuspecting generosity, that his lordship acquitted him\nof any share in the deceit, and contented himself with the restitution,\nwhich he insisted upon making out of his own pocket, until he should be\nable to apprehend the rogue, who had thought proper to abscond for his\nown safety. In spite of all this exculpation, his character did not\nfail to retain a sort of stigma, which indeed the plainest proofs of\ninnocence are hardly able to efface; and his connexion with such a\npalpable knave as the Tyrolese appeared to be, had an effect to his\nprejudice in the minds of all those who were privy to the occurrence."

A few whispers communicated by the envious mouth\nof slander, which he can have no opportunity to answer and refute,\nshall, in the opinion of the world, convict him of the most horrid\ncrimes; and for one hypocrite who is decked with the honours of virtue,\nthere are twenty good men who suffer the ignominy of vice; so well\ndisposed are individuals to trample upon the fame of their\nfellow-creatures. If the most unblemished merit is not protected from\nthis injustice, it will not be wondered at that no quarter was given to\nthe character of an adventurer like Fathom, who, among other unlucky\noccurrences, had the misfortune to be recognised about this time by his\ntwo Parisian friends, Sir Stentor Stile and Sir Giles Squirrel.These worthy knights-errant had returned to their own country, after\nhaving made a very prosperous campaign in France, at the end of which,\nhowever, they very narrowly escaped the galleys; and seeing the Polish\nCount seated at the head of taste and politeness, they immediately\ncirculated the story of his defeat at Paris, with many ludicrous\ncircumstances of their own invention, and did not scruple to affirm\nthat he was a rank impostor. When the laugh is raised upon a great man,\nhe never fails to dwindle into contempt. Ferdinand began to perceive a\nchange in the countenance of his friends. His company was no longer\nsolicited with that eagerness which they had formerly expressed in his\nbehalf. Even his entertainments were neglected; when he appeared at any\nprivate or public assembly, the ladies, instead of glowing with\npleasure, as formerly, now tittered or regarded him with looks of\ndisdain; and a certain pert, little, forward coquette, with a view to\nput him out of countenance, by raising the laugh at his expense, asked\nhim one night, at a drum, when he had heard from his relations in\nPoland? She succeeded in her design upon the mirth of the audience, but\nwas disappointed in the other part of her aim; for our hero replied,\nwithout the least mark of discomposure, “They are all in good health at\nyour service, madam; I wish I knew in what part of the world your\nrelations reside, that I might return the compliment.” By this answer,\nwhich was the more severe, as the young lady was of very doubtful\nextraction, he retorted the laugh upon the aggressor, though he\nlikewise failed in his attempt upon her temper; for she was perhaps the\nonly person present who equalled himself in stability of countenance."
