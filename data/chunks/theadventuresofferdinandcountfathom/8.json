  "content": "His lordship was not only pleased, but proud to see such a stranger at\nhis gate, and entertained him with excess of complaisance and\nhospitality; insomuch that, by his means, our hero soon became\nacquainted with the whole circle of polite company, by whom he was\ncaressed for his insinuating manners and agreeable conversation. He had\nthought proper to tell the nobleman, at their first interview in town,\nthat his reasons for concealing his knowledge of the English tongue\nwere now removed, and that he would no longer deny himself the pleasure\nof speaking a language which had been always music to his ear. He had\nalso thanked his lordship for his generous interposition at the inn,\nwhich was an instance of that generosity and true politeness which are\nengrossed by the English people, who leave nought to other nations but\nthe mere shadow of these virtues.A testimony like this, from the mouth of such a noble stranger, won the\nheart of the peer, who professed a friendship for him on the spot, and\nundertook to see justice done to his lacquey, who in a short time was\ngratified with a share of the seizure which had been made upon his\ninformation, amounting to fifty or sixty pounds.Ferdinand put not forth the whole strength of his accomplishments at\nonce, but contrived to spring a new mine of qualification every day, to\nthe surprise and admiration of all his acquaintance. He was gifted with\na sort of elocution, much more specious than solid, and spoke on every\nsubject that occurred in conversation with that familiarity and ease,\nwhich, one would think, could only be acquired by long study and\napplication. This plausibility and confidence are faculties really\ninherited from nature, and effectually serve the possessor, in lieu of\nthat learning which is not to be obtained without infinite toil and\nperseverance. The most superficial tincture of the arts and sciences in\nsuch a juggler, is sufficient to dazzle the understanding of half\nmankind; and, if managed with circumspection, will enable him even to\nspend his life among the literati, without once forfeiting the\ncharacter of a connoisseur.Our hero was perfectly master of this legerdemain, which he carried to\nsuch a pitch of assurance, as to declare, in the midst of a\nmathematical assembly, that he intended to gratify the public with a\nfull confutation of Sir Isaac Newton’s philosophy, to the nature of\nwhich he was as much a stranger as the most savage Hottentot in Africa.\nHis pretensions to profound and universal knowledge were supported not\nonly by this kind of presumption, but also by the facility with which\nhe spoke so many different languages, and the shrewd remarks he had\nmade in the course of his travels and observation."

With officers, he reformed the art of war, with\nimprovements which had occurred to his reflection while he was engaged\nin a military life. He sometimes held forth upon painting, like a\nmember of the Dilettanti club. The theory of music was a theme upon\nwhich he seemed to expatiate with particular pleasure. In the provinces\nof love and gallantry, he was a perfect Oroondates. He possessed a most\nagreeable manner of telling entertaining stories, of which he had a\nlarge collection; he sung with great melody and taste, and played upon\nthe violin with surprising execution. To these qualifications let us\nadd his affability and pliant disposition, and then the reader will not\nwonder that he was looked upon as the pattern of human perfection, and\nhis acquaintance courted accordingly.While he thus captivated the favour and affection of the English\nnobility, he did not neglect to take other measures in behalf of the\npartnership to which he had subscribed. The adventure with the two\nsquires at Paris had weakened his appetite for play, which was not at\nall restored by the observations he had made in London, where the art\nof gaming is reduced into a regular system, and its professors so\nlaudably devoted to the discharge of their functions, as to observe the\nmost temperate regimen, lest their invention should be impaired by the\nfatigue of watching or exercise, and their ideas disturbed by the fumes\nof indigestion. No Indian Brachman could live more abstemious than two\nof the pack, who hunted in couple, and kennelled in the upper\napartments of the hotel in which our adventurer lived. They abstained\nfrom animal food with the abhorrence of Pythagoreans, their drink was a\npure simple element, they were vomited once a week, took physic or a\nglyster every third day, spent the forenoon in algebraical\ncalculations, and slept from four o’clock till midnight, that they\nmight then take the field with that cool serenity which is the effect\nof refreshment and repose."

Indeed, no man ever set out with a\nfairer prospect on such an expedition; for he had found means to render\nhimself so agreeable to the fair sex, that, like the boxes of the\nplayhouse, during the representation of a new performance, his company\nwas often bespoke for a series of weeks; and no lady, whether widow,\nwife, or maiden, ever mentioned his name, without some epithet of\nesteem or affection; such as the dear Count! the charming Man! the\nNonpareil, or the Angel!While he thus shone in the zenith of admiration, it is not to be\ndoubted, that he could have melted some wealthy dowager or opulent\nward; but, being an enemy to all precipitate engagements, he resolved\nto act with great care and deliberation in an affair of such\nimportance, especially as he did not find himself hurried by the\nimportunities of want; for, since his arrival in England, he had rather\nincreased than exhausted his finances, by methods equally certain and\nsecure. In a word, he, with the assistance of Ratchcali, carried on a\ntraffic, which yielded great profits, without subjecting the trader to\nthe least loss or inconvenience. Fathom, for example, wore upon his\nfinger a large brilliant, which he played to such advantage one night,\nat a certain nobleman’s house, where he was prevailed upon to entertain\nthe company with a solo on the violin, that everybody present took\nnotice of its uncommon lustre, and it was handed about for the perusal\nof every individual. The water and the workmanship were universally\nadmired; and one among the rest having expressed a desire of knowing\nthe value of such a jewel, the Count seized that opportunity of\nentertaining them with a learned disquisition into the nature of\nstones; this introduced the history of the diamond in question, which\nhe said had been purchased of an Indian trader of Fort St. George, at\nan under price; so that the present proprietor could afford to sell it\nat a very reasonable rate; and concluded with telling the company,\nthat, for his own part, he had been importuned to wear it by the\njeweller, who imagined it would have a better chance for attracting a\npurchaser on his finger, than while it remained in his own custody."

Nor was this bargain such as reflected\ndishonour upon the lady’s taste, or could be productive of ill\nconsequences to the merchant; for the method of estimating diamonds is\naltogether arbitrary; and Ratchcali, who was an exquisite lapidary, had\nset it in such a manner as would have imposed upon any ordinary\njeweller. By these means of introduction, the Tyrolese soon monopolised\nthe custom of a great many noble families, upon which he levied large\ncontributions, without incurring the least suspicion of deceit. He\nevery day, out of pure esteem and gratitude for the honour of their\ncommands, entertained them with the sight of some new trinket, which he\nwas never permitted to carry home unsold; and from the profits of each\njob, a tax was raised for the benefit of our adventurer.Yet his indultos were not confined to the article of jewels, which\nconstituted only one part of his revenue. By the industry of his\nunderstrapper, he procured a number of old crazy fiddles, which were\nthrown aside as lumber; upon which he counterfeited the Cremona mark,\nand otherwise cooked them up with great dexterity; so that, when he had\noccasion to regale the lovers of music, he would send for one of these\nvamped instruments, and extract from it such tones as quite ravished\nthe hearers; among whom there was always some conceited pretender, who\nspoke in raptures of the violin, and gave our hero an opportunity of\nlaunching out in its praise, and declaring it was the best Cremona he\nhad ever touched. This encomium never failed to inflame the desires of\nthe audience, to some one of whom he was generous enough to part with\nit at prime cost—that is, for twenty or thirty guineas clear profit;\nfor he was often able to oblige his friends in this manner, because,\nbeing an eminent connoisseur, his countenance was solicited by all the\nmusicians, who wanted to dispose of such moveables."

Every\nauction afforded some picture, in which, though it had been overlooked\nby the ignorance of the times, he recognised the style of a great\nmaster, and made a merit of recommending it to some noble friend. This\ncommerce he likewise extended to medals, bronzes, busts, intaglios, and\nold china, and kept divers artificers continually employed in making\nantiques for the English nobility. Thus he went on with such rapidity\nof success in all his endeavours, that he himself was astonished at the\ninfatuation he had produced. Nothing was so wretched among the\nproductions of art, that he could not impose upon the world as a\ncapital performance; and so fascinated were the eyes of his admirers,\nhe could easily have persuaded them that a barber’s bason was an\nEtrurian patera, and the cover of a copper pot no other than the shield\nof Ancus Martius. In short, it was become so fashionable to consult the\nCount in everything relating to taste and politeness, that not a plan\nwas drawn, not even a house furnished, without his advice and\napprobation; nay, to such a degree did his reputation in these matters\nexcel, that a particular pattern of paper-hangings was known by the\nname of Fathom; and his hall was every morning crowded with\nupholsterers, and other tradesmen, who came, by order of their\nemployers, to learn his choice, and take his directions.The character and influence he thus acquired, he took care to maintain\nwith the utmost assiduity and circumspection. He never failed to appear\nthe chief personage at all public diversions and private assemblies,\nnot only in conversation and dress, but also in the article of dancing,\nin which he outstripped all his fellows, as far as in every other\ngenteel accomplishment.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREEHE ATTRACTS THE ENVY AND ILL OFFICES OF THE MINOR KNIGHTS OF HIS OWN\nORDER, OVER WHOM HE OBTAINS A COMPLETE VICTORY.Such a pre-eminence could not be enjoyed without exciting the\nmalevolence of envy and detraction, in the propagation of which none\nwere so industrious as the brethren of his own order, who had, like\nhim, made a descent upon this island, and could not, without repining,\nsee the whole harvest in the hands of one man, who, with equal art and\ndiscretion, avoided all intercourse with their society. In vain they\nstrove to discover his pedigree, and detect the particular\ncircumstances of his life and conversation; all their inquiries were\nbaffled by the obscurity of his origin, and that solitary scheme which\nhe had adopted in the beginning of his career. The whole fruit of their\ninvestigation amounted to no more than a certainty that there was no\nfamily of any consideration in Europe known by the denomination of\nFathom; and this discovery they did not fail to divulge for the benefit\nof our adventurer, who had by this time taken such firm root in the\nfavour of the great, as to set all those little arts at defiance; and\nwhen the report reached his ear, actually made his friends merry with\nthe conjectures which had been circulated at his expense."

It was upon this supposition that they left to the\ndetermination of the dice the choice of the person who should execute\ntheir plan; and the lot falling upon a Swiss, who, from the station of\na foot soldier in the Dutch service, out of which he had been drummed\nfor theft, had erected himself into the rank of a self-created\nchevalier, this hero fortified himself with a double dose of brandy,\nand betook himself to a certain noted coffee-house, with an intent to\naffront Count Fathom in public.He was lucky enough to find our adventurer sitting at a table in\nconversation with some persons of the first rank; upon which he seated\nhimself in the next box, and after having intruded himself into their\ndiscourse, which happened to turn upon the politics of some German\ncourts, “Count,” said he to Ferdinand, in a very abrupt and\ndisagreeable manner of address, “I was last night in company with some\ngentlemen, among whom a dispute happened about the place of your\nnativity; pray, what country are you of?” “Sir,” answered the other,\nwith great politeness, “I at present have the honour to be of England.”\n“Oho!” replied the chevalier, “I ask your pardon, that is to say, you\nare incog; some people may find it convenient to keep themselves in\nthat situation.” “True,” said the Count, “but some people are too well\nknown to enjoy that privilege.” The Swiss being a little disconcerted\nat this repartee, which extracted a smile from the audience, after some\npause, observed, that persons of a certain class had good reason to\ndrop the remembrance of what they have been; but a good citizen will\nnot forget his country, or former condition. “And a bad citizen,” said\nFathom, “cannot, if he would, provided he has met with his deserts; a\nsharper may as well forget the shape of a die, or a discarded soldier\nthe sound of a drum.”"

  "content": "As the chevalier’s character and story were not unknown, this\napplication raised an universal laugh at his expense, which provoked\nhim to such a degree, that, starting up, he swore Fathom could not have\nmentioned any object in nature that he himself resembled so much as a\ndrum, which was exactly typified by his emptiness and sound, with this\ndifference, however, that a drum was never noisy till beaten, whereas\nthe Count would never be quiet, until he should have undergone the same\ndiscipline. So saying, he laid his hand upon his sword with a menacing\nlook, and walked out as if in expectation of being followed by our\nadventurer, who suffered himself to be detained by the company, and\nvery calmly took notice, that his antagonist would not be ill pleased\nat their interposition. Perhaps he would not have comported himself\nwith such ease and deliberation, had not he made such remarks upon the\ndisposition of the chevalier, as convinced him of his own safety. He\nhad perceived a perplexity and perturbation in the countenance of the\nSwiss, when he first entered the coffee-room; his blunt and precipitate\nway of accosting him seemed to denote confusion and compulsion; and, in\nthe midst of his ferocity, this accurate observer discerned the\ntrepidation of fear. By the help of these signs, his sagacity soon\ncomprehended the nature of his schemes, and prepared accordingly for a\nformal defiance.His conjecture was verified next morning by a visit from the chevalier,\nwho, taking it for granted that Fathom would not face an adversary in\nthe field, because he had not followed him from the coffee-house, went\nto his lodgings with great confidence, and demanded to see the Count\nupon an affair that would admit of no delay. Maurice, according to his\ninstructions, told him that his master was gone out, but desired he\nwould have the goodness to repose himself in the parlour, till the\nCount’s return, which he expected every moment. Ferdinand, who had\ntaken post in a proper place for observation, seeing his antagonist\nfairly admitted, took the same road, and appearing before him, wrapped\nup in a long Spanish cloak, desired to know what had procured him the\nhonour of such an early visit. The Swiss, raising his voice to conceal\nhis agitation, explained his errand, in demanding reparation for the\ninjury his honour had sustained the preceding day, in that odious\nallusion to a scandalous report which had been raised by the malice of\nhis enemies; and insisted, in a very imperious style, upon his\nattending him forthwith to the nursery in Hyde Park. “Have a little\npatience,” said our adventurer with great composure, “and I will do\nmyself the pleasure to wait upon you in a few moments.”"

This phenomenon made\nsuch an impression upon the astonished chevalier, already discomposed\nby the resolute behaviour of the Count, that he became jaundiced with\nterror and dismay, and, while his teeth chattered in his head, told our\nhero he had hoped, from his known politeness, to have found him ready\nto acknowledge an injury which might have been the effect of anger or\nmisapprehension, in which case the affair might have been compromised\nto their mutual satisfaction, without proceeding to those extremities\nwhich, among men of honour, are always accounted the last resource. To\nthis representation Ferdinand answered, that the affair had been of the\nchevalier’s own seeking, inasmuch as he had intruded himself into his\ncompany, and treated him with the most insolent and unprovoked abuse,\nwhich plainly flowed from a premeditated design against his honour and\nreputation; he, therefore, far from being disposed to own himself in\nthe wrong, would not even accept of a public acknowledgment from him,\nthe aggressor, whom he looked upon as an infamous sharper, and was\nresolved to chastise accordingly.Here the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a person who\nwas brought to the door in a chair, and conducted into another\napartment, from which a message was brought to the Count, importing,\nthat the stranger desired to speak with him upon business of the last\nimportance. Fathom having chid the servant for admitting people without\nhis order, desired the Swiss to excuse him for a minute longer, and\nwent in to the next room, from whence the following dialogue was\noverheard by this challenger:—“Count,” said the stranger, “you are not\nignorant of my pretensions to the heart of that young lady, at whose\nhouse I met you yesterday; therefore you cannot be surprised when I\ndeclare myself displeased with your visits and behaviour to my\nmistress, and demand that you will instantly promise to drop the\ncorrespondence.” “Else what follows?” answered Ferdinand, with a cool\nand temperate voice. “My resentment and immediate defiance,” replied\nthe other; “for the only alternative I propose is, to forego your\ndesign upon that lady, or to decide our pretension by the sword.”"

But this admonition, instead of appeasing the\nwrath, seemed to inflame the resentment of the opponent, who swore he\nwould not leave him until he should have accomplished the purport of\nhis errand. In vain our adventurer requested half an hour for the\ndespatch of some urgent business, in which he was engaged with a\ngentleman in the other parlour. This impetuous rival rejected all the\nterms he could propose, and even challenged him to decide the\ncontroversy upon the spot; an expedient to which the other having\nassented with reluctance, the door was secured, the swords unsheathed,\nand a hot engagement ensued, to the inexpressible pleasure of the\nSwiss, who did not doubt that he himself would be screened from all\ndanger by the event of this rencontre. Nevertheless, his hope was\ndisappointed in the defeat of the stranger, who was quickly disarmed,\nin consequence of a wound through the sword-arm; upon which occasion\nFathom was heard to say, that, in consideration of his youth and\nfamily, he had spared his life; but he would not act with the same\ntenderness towards any other antagonist. He then bound up the limb he\nhad disabled, conducted the vanquished party to his chair, rejoined the\nchevalier with a serene countenance, and, asking pardon for having\ndetained him so long, proposed they should instantly set out in a\nhackney-coach for the place of appointment.The stratagem thus conducted, had all the success the inventor could\ndesire. The fear of the Swiss had risen almost to an ecstasy before the\nCount quitted the room; but after this sham battle, which had been\npreconcerted betwixt our adventurer and his friend Ratchcali, the\nchevalier’s terrors were unspeakable. He considered Fathom as a devil\nincarnate, and went into the coach as a malefactor bound for Tyburn. He\nwould have gladly compounded for the loss of a leg or arm, and\nentertained some transient gleams of hope, that he should escape for\nhalf a dozen flesh-wounds, which he would have willingly received as\nthe price of his presumption; but these hopes were banished by the\nremembrance of that dreadful declaration which he had heard the Count\nmake, after having overcome his last adversary; and he continued under\nthe power of the most unsupportable panic, until the carriage halted at\nHyde Park Corner, where he crawled forth in a most piteous and\nlamentable condition; so that, when they reached the spot, he was\nscarce able to stand.Here he made an effort to speak, and propose an accommodation upon a\nnew plan, by which he promised to leave his cause to the arbitrement of\nthose gentlemen who were present at the rupture, and to ask pardon of\nthe Count, provided he should be found guilty of a trespass upon good\nmanners; but this proposal would not satisfy the implacable Ferdinand,\nwho, perceiving the agony of the Swiss, resolved to make the most of\nthe adventure, and giving him to understand he was not a man to be\ntrifled with, desired him to draw without further preamble. Thus\ncompelled, the unfortunate gamester pulled off his coat, and, putting\nhimself in a posture, to use the words of Nym, “winked, and held out\nhis cold iron.”"

The chevalier, already\nstupefied with the horror of expectation, no sooner felt his\nadversary’s point in his body than he fell to the ground, and,\nconcluding he was no longer a man for this world, began to cross\nhimself with great devotion; while Fathom walked home deliberately, and\nin his way sent a couple of chairmen to the assistance of the wounded\nknight.This achievement, which could not be concealed from the knowledge of\nthe public, not only furnished the character of Fathom with fresh\nwreaths of admiration and applause, but likewise effectually secured\nhim from any future attempts of his enemies, to whom the Swiss, for his\nown sake, had communicated such terrible ideas of his valour, as\noverawed the whole community.CHAPTER THIRTY-FOURHE PERFORMS ANOTHER EXPLOIT, THAT CONVEYS A TRUE IDEA OF HIS GRATITUDE\nAND HONOUR.It was not long after this celebrated victory, that he was invited to\nspend part of the summer at the house of a country gentleman, who lived\nabout one hundred miles from London, possessed of a very opulent\nfortune, the greatest part of which was expended in acts of old English\nhospitality. He had met with our hero by accident at the table of a\ncertain great man, and was so struck with his manner and conversation,\nas to desire his acquaintance, and cultivate his friendship; and he\nthought himself extremely happy in having prevailed upon him to pass a\nfew weeks in his family."

This circumstance was not unknown to his\nlady, by whose express approbation he had bestowed particular attention\nupon the education of the child, whom we shall distinguish by the name\nof Celinda. Their liberality in this particular had not been\nmisapplied; for she not only gave marks of uncommon capacity, but, as\nshe grew up, became more and more amiable in her person, and was now\nreturned from the boarding school, possessed of every accomplishment\nthat could be acquired by one of her age and opportunities. These\nqualifications, which endeared her to every other person, excited the\njealousy and displeasure of her supposed aunt, who could not bear to\nsee her own children eclipsed by this illegitimate daughter, whom she\ntherefore discountenanced upon all occasions, and exposed to such\nmortifications as would in all appearance drive her from her father’s\nhouse. This persecuting spirit was very disagreeable to the husband,\nwho loved Celinda with a truly paternal affection, and produced\nabundance of family disquiet; but being a man of a peaceable and\nyielding disposition, he could not long maintain the resolution he had\ntaken in her favour, and therefore he ceased opposing the malevolence\nof his wife.In this unfortunate predicament stood the fair bastard, at the arrival\nof our adventurer, who, being allured by her charms, apprised of her\nsituation at the same time, took the generous resolution to undermine\nher innocence, that he might banquet his vicious appetite with the\nspoils of her beauty. Perhaps such a brutal design might not have\nentered his imagination, if he had not observed, in the disposition of\nthis hapless maiden, certain peculiarities from which he derived the\nmost confident presages of success. Besides a total want of experience,\nthat left her open and unguarded against the attacks of the other sex,\nshe discovered a remarkable spirit of credulity and superstitious fear,\nwhich had been cherished by the conversation of her school-fellows. She\nwas particularly fond of music, in which she had made some progress;\nbut so delicate was the texture of her nerves, that one day, while\nFathom entertained the company with a favourite air, she actually\nswooned with pleasure."

That he\nmight the more effectually deceive the vigilance of her father’s wife,\nhe threw such a dash of affectation in his complaisance towards\nCelinda, as could not escape the notice of that prying matron, though\nit was not palpable enough to disoblige the young lady herself, who\ncould not so well distinguish between overstrained courtesy and real\ngood breeding. This behaviour screened him from the suspicion of the\nfamily, who considered it as an effort of politeness, to cover his\nindifference and disgust for the daughter of his friend, who had by\nthis time given some reason to believe she looked upon him with the\neyes of affection; so that the opportunities he enjoyed of conversing\nwith her in private, were less liable to intrusion or inquiry. Indeed,\nfrom what I have already observed, touching the sentiments of her\nstepdame, that lady, far from taking measures for thwarting our hero’s\ndesign, would have rejoiced at the execution of it, and, had she been\ninformed of his intent, might have fallen upon some method to\nfacilitate the enterprise; but, as he solely depended upon his own\ntalents, he never dreamed of soliciting such an auxiliary.Under cover of instructing and accomplishing her in the exercise of\nmusic, he could not want occasions for promoting his aim; when, after\nhaving soothed her sense of hearing, even to a degree of ravishment, so\nas to extort from her an exclamation, importing, that he was surely\nsomething supernatural! he never failed to whisper some insidious\ncompliment or tale of love, exquisitely suited to the emotions of her\nsoul. Thus was her heart insensibly subdued; though more than half his\nwork was still undone; for, at all times, she disclosed such purity of\nsentiment, such inviolable attachment to religion and virtue, and\nseemed so averse to all sorts of inflammatory discourse, that he durst\nnot presume upon the footing he had gained in her affection, to explain\nthe baseness of his desire; he therefore applied to another of her\npassions, that proved the bane of her virtue. This was her timidity,\nwhich at first being constitutional, was afterwards increased by the\ncircumstances of her education, and now aggravated by the artful\nconversation of Fathom, which he chequered with dismal stories of\nomens, portents, prophecies, and apparitions, delivered upon such\nunquestionable testimony, and with such marks of conviction, as\ncaptivated the belief of the devoted Celinda, and filled her\nimagination with unceasing terrors."

The more she endeavoured to banish\nthem, the more troublesome they became; and such was her infatuation,\nthat as her terrors increased, her thirst after that sort of knowledge\nwas augmented. Many sleepless nights did she pass amidst those horrors\nof fancy, starting at every noise, and sweating with dreary\napprehension, yet ashamed to own her fears, or solicit the comfort of a\nbedfellow, lest she should incur the ridicule and censure of her\nfather’s wife; and what rendered this disposition the more irksome, was\nthe solitary situation of her chamber, that stood at the end of a long\ngallery scarce within hearing of any other inhabited part of the house.All these circumstances had been duly weighed by our projector, who,\nhaving prepared Celinda for his purpose, stole at midnight from his\napartment, which was in another storey, and approaching her door, there\nuttered a piteous groan; then softly retired to his bed, in full\nconfidence of seeing next day the effect of this operation. Nor did his\narrow miss the mark. Poor Celinda’s countenance gave such indications\nof melancholy and dismay, that he could not omit asking the cause of\nher disquiet, and she, at his earnest request, was prevailed upon to\ncommunicate the dreadful salutation of the preceding night, which she\nconsidered as an omen of death to some person of the family, in all\nprobability to herself, as the groan seemed to issue from one corner of\nher own apartment. Our adventurer argued against this supposition, as\ncontradictory to the common observation of those supernatural warnings\nwhich are not usually imparted to the person who is doomed to die, but\nto some faithful friend, or trusty servant, particularly interested in\nthe event. He therefore supposed, that the groans foreboded the death\nof my lady, who seemed to be in a drooping state of health, and were,\nby her genius, conveyed to the organs of Celinda, who was the chief\nsufferer by her jealous and barbarous disposition; he likewise\nexpressed an earnest desire to be an ear-witness of such solemn\ncommunication, and, alleging that it was highly improper for a young\nlady of her delicate feelings to expose herself alone to such another\ndismal visitation, begged he might be allowed to watch all night in her\nchamber, in order to defend her from the shocking impressions of fear."

Not that she thought her\ninnocence or reputation could suffer by her compliance with his\nrequest; for, hitherto, her heart was a stranger to those young desires\nwhich haunt the fancy, and warm the breast of youth; so that, being\nignorant of her danger, she saw not the necessity of avoiding\ntemptation; but she refused to admit a man into her bedchamber, merely\nbecause it was a step altogether opposite to the forms and decorum of\nlife. Nevertheless, far from being discouraged by this repulse, he knew\nher fears would multiply and reduce that reluctance, which, in order to\nweaken, he had recourse to another piece of machinery, that operated\npowerfully in behalf of his design.Some years ago, a twelve-stringed instrument was contrived by a very\ningenious musician, by whom it was aptly entitled the “Harp of Aeolus,”\nbecause, being properly applied to a stream of air, it produces a wild\nirregular variety of harmonious sounds, that seem to be the effect of\nenchantment, and wonderfully dispose the mind for the most romantic\nsituations. Fathom, who was really a virtuoso in music, had brought one\nof those new-fashioned guitars into the country, and as the effect of\nit was still unknown in the family, he that night converted it to the\npurposes of his amour, by fixing it in the casement of a window\nbelonging to the gallery, exposed to the west wind, which then blew in\na gentle breeze. The strings no sooner felt the impression of the balmy\nzephyr, than they began to pour forth a stream of melody more\nravishingly delightful than the song of Philomel, the warbling brook,\nand all the concert of the wood. The soft and tender notes of peace and\nlove were swelled up with the most delicate and insensible transition\ninto a loud hymn of triumph and exultation, joined by the deep-toned\norgan, and a full choir of voices, which gradually decayed upon the\near, until it died away in distant sound, as if a flight of angels had\nraised the song in their ascent to heaven. Yet the chords hardly ceased\nto vibrate after the expiration of this overture, which ushered in a\ncomposition in the same pathetic style; and this again was succeeded by\na third, almost without pause or intermission, as if the artist’s hand\nhad been indefatigable, and the theme never to be exhausted."

She was\noverwhelmed with awful terror, and, never doubting that the sounds were\nmore than mortal, recommended herself to the care of Providence in a\nsuccession of pious ejaculations.Our adventurer, having allowed some time for the effect of this\ncontrivance, repaired to her chamber door, and, in a whisper, conveyed\nthrough the keyhole, asked if she was awake, begged pardon for such an\nunseasonable visit, and desired to know her opinion of the strange\nmusic which he then heard. In spite of her notions of decency, she was\nglad of his intrusion, and, being in no condition to observe\npunctilios, slipped on a wrapper, opened the door, and, with a\nfaltering voice, owned herself frightened almost to distraction. He\npretended to console her with reflections, importing, that she was in\nthe hands of a benevolent Being, who would not impose upon his\ncreatures any task which they could not bear; he insisted upon her\nreturning to bed, and assured her he would not stir from her chamber\ntill day. Thus comforted, she betook herself again to rest, while he\nsat down in an elbow-chair at some distance from the bedside, and, in a\nsoft voice, began the conversation with her on the subject of those\nvisitations from above, which, though undertaken on pretence of\ndissipating her fear and anxiety, was, in reality, calculated for the\npurpose of augmenting both.“That sweet air,” said he, “seems designed for soothing the bodily\nanguish of some saint in his last moments. Hark! how it rises into a\nmore sprightly and elevated strain, as if it were an inspiriting\ninvitation to the realms of bliss! Sure, he is now absolved from all\nthe misery of this life! That full and glorious concert of voices and\ncelestial harps betoken his reception among the heavenly choir, who now\nwaft his soul to paradisian joys! This is altogether great, solemn, and\namazing! The clock strikes one, the symphony hath ceased!”"

As for poor\nCelinda, her fancy was, by his music and discourse, worked up to the\nhighest pitch of enthusiastic terrors; the whole bed shook with her\ntrepidation, the awful silence that succeeded the supernatural music\nthrew an additional damp upon her spirits, and the artful Fathom\naffecting to snore at the same time, she could no longer contain her\nhorror, but called upon his name with a fearful accent, and, having\nowned her present situation insupportable, entreated him to draw near\nher bedside, that he might be within touch on any emergency.This was a welcome request to our adventurer, who, asking pardon for\nhis drowsiness, and taking his station on the side of her bed, exhorted\nher to compose herself; then locking her hand fast in his own, was\nagain seized with such an inclination to sleep, that he gradually sunk\ndown by her side, and seemed to enjoy his repose in that attitude.\nMeanwhile, his tender-hearted mistress, that he might not suffer in his\nhealth by his humanity and complaisance, covered him with the\ncounterpane as he slept, and suffered him to take his rest without\ninterruption, till he thought proper to start up suddenly with an\nexclamation of, “Heaven watch over us!” and then asked, with symptoms\nof astonishment, if she had heard nothing. Such an abrupt address upon\nsuch an occasion, did not fail to amaze and affright the gentle\nCelinda, who, unable to speak, sprung towards her treacherous\nprotector; and he, catching her in his arms, bade her fear nothing, for\nhe would, at the expense of his life, defend her from all danger.Having thus, by tampering with her weakness, conquered the first and\nchief obstacles to his design, he, with great art and perseverance,\nimproved the intercourse to such a degree of intimacy, as could not but\nbe productive of all the consequences which he had foreseen. The groans\nand music were occasionally repeated, so as to alarm the whole family,\nand inspire a thousand various conjectures. He failed not to continue\nhis nocturnal visits and ghastly discourse, until his attendance became\nso necessary to this unhappy maiden, that she durst not stay in her own\nchamber without his company, nor even sleep, except in contact with her\nbetrayer."

In her paroxysms of dismay, he did not\nforget to breathe the soft inspirations of his passion, to which she\nlistened with more pleasure, as they diverted the gloomy ideas of her\nfear; and by this time his extraordinary accomplishments had made a\nconquest of her heart. What therefore could be a more interesting\ntransition than that from the most uneasy to the most agreeable\nsensation of the human breast?This being the case, the reader will not wonder that a consummate\ntraitor, like Fathom, should triumph over the virtue of an artless,\ninnocent young creature, whose passions he had entirely under his\ncommand. The gradations towards vice are almost imperceptible, and an\nexperienced seducer can strew them with such enticing and agreeable\nflowers, as will lead the young sinner on insensibly, even to the most\nprofligate stages of guilt. All therefore that can be done by virtue,\nunassisted with experience, is to avoid every trial with such a\nformidable foe, by declining and discouraging the first advances\ntowards a particular correspondence with perfidious man, howsoever\nagreeable it may seem to be. For here is no security but in conscious\nweakness.Fathom, though possessed of the spoils of poor Celinda’s honour, did\nnot enjoy his success with tranquillity. Reflection and remorse often\ninvaded her in the midst of their guilty pleasures, and embittered all\nthose moments they had dedicated to mutual bliss. For the seeds of\nvirtue are seldom destroyed at once. Even amidst the rank productions\nof vice, they regerminate to a sort of imperfect vegetation, like some\nscattered hyacinths shooting up among the weeds of a ruined garden,\nthat testify the former culture and amenity of the soil. She sighed at\nthe sad remembrance of that virgin dignity which she had lost; she wept\nat the prospect of that disgrace, mortification, and misery she should\nundergo, when abandoned by this transient lover, and severely\nreproached him for the arts he had used to shipwreck her innocence and\npeace."

They act like strong\nblasts of wind applied to embers almost extinguished, which, instead of\nreviving the flame, scatter and destroy every remaining particle of\nfire. Our adventurer, in the midst of his peculiarities, had\ninconstancy in common with the rest of his sex. More than half cloyed\nwith the possession of Celinda, he could not fail to be disgusted with\nher upbraidings; and had she not been the daughter of a gentleman whose\nfriendship he did not think it his interest to forfeit, he would have\ndropped this correspondence, without reluctance or hesitation. But, as\nhe had measures to keep with a family of such consequence, he\nconstrained his inclinations, so far as to counterfeit those raptures\nhe no longer felt, and found means to appease those intervening tumults\nof her grief.Foreseeing, however, that it would not be always in his power to\nconsole her on these terms, he resolved, if possible, to divide her\naffection, which now glowed upon him too intensely; and, with that\nview, whenever she complained of the vapours or dejection, he\nprescribed, and even insisted upon her swallowing certain cordials of\nthe most palatable composition, without which he never travelled; and\nthese produced such agreeable reveries and flow of spirits, that she\ngradually became enamoured of intoxication; while he encouraged the\npernicious passion, by expressing the most extravagant applause and\nadmiration at the wild irregular sallies it produced. Without having\nfirst made this diversion, he would have found it impracticable to\nleave the house with tranquillity; but, when this bewitching philtre\ngrew into an habit, her attachment to Ferdinand was insensibly\ndissolved; she began to bear his neglect with indifference, and,\nsequestering herself from the rest of the family, used to solicit this\nnew ally for consolation."

As for the miserable\nCelinda, she became more and more addicted to the vices in which she\nhad been initiated by his superlative perfidy and craft, until she was\nquite abandoned by decency and caution. Her father’s heart was torn\nwith anguish, while his wife rejoiced in her fall; at length her ideas\nwere quite debased by her infirmity; she grew every day more and more\nsensual and degenerate, and contracted an intimacy with one of the\nfootmen, who was kind enough to take her to wife, in hope of obtaining\na good settlement from his master; but, being disappointed in his aim,\nhe conducted her to London, where he made shift to insinuate himself\ninto another service, leaving her to the use, and partly the advantage,\nof her own person, which was still uncommonly attractive.CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVEHE REPAIRS TO BRISTOL SPRING, WHERE HE REIGNS PARAMOUNT DURING THE\nWHOLE SEASON.We shall therefore leave her in this comfortable situation, and return\nto our adventurer, whose appearance at Bristol was considered as a\nhappy omen by the proprietor of the hot well, and all the people who\nlive by the resort of company to that celebrated spring. Nor were they\ndeceived in their prognostic. Fathom, as usual, formed the nucleus or\nkernel of the beau monde; and the season soon became so crowded, that\nmany people of fashion were obliged to quit the place for want of\nlodging. Ferdinand was the soul that animated the whole society. He not\nonly invented parties of pleasure, but also, by his personal talents,\nrendered them more agreeable. In a word, he regulated their diversions,\nand the master of the ceremonies never would allow the ball to be begun\ntill the Count was seated."
