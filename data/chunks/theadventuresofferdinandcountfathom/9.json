  "content": "These resolutions being taken, he met his fate with great fortitude and\nequanimity, and calmly suffered himself to be conveyed to the house of\na sheriff’s officer, who, as he made his exit from the hall, according\nto his own expectation, executed a writ against him, at the suit of\nTrapwell, for a debt of two thousand pounds. To this place he was\nfollowed by his solicitor, who was allured by the prospect of another\njob, and who, with great demonstrations of satisfaction, congratulated\nhim upon the happy issue of the trial; arrogating to himself the merit\nof having saved him eight thousand pounds in the article of damages, by\nthe previous steps he had taken, and the noble defence that he and his\nfriends the counsel had made for their client; he even hinted an\nexpectation of receiving a gratuity for his extraordinary care and\ndiscretion.Fathom, galled as he was with his misfortune, and enraged at the\neffrontery of this pettifogger, maintained a serenity of countenance,\nand sent the attorney with a message to the plaintiff, importing, that,\nas he was a foreigner, and could not be supposed to have so much cash\nabout him, as to spare fifteen hundred pounds from the funds of his\nordinary expense, he would grant him a bond payable in two months,\nduring which period he should be able to procure a proper remittance\nfrom his own estate. While the solicitor was employed in this\nnegotiation, he despatched his valet-de-chambre to one nobleman, and\nMaurice to another, with billets, signifying the nature of the verdict\nwhich his adversary had obtained, and desiring that each would lend him\na thousand pounds upon his parole, until he could negotiate bills upon\nthe Continent.His three messengers returned almost at the same instant of time, and\nthese were the answers they brought back.Trapwell absolutely rejected his personal security; and threatened him\nwith all the horrors of a jail, unless he would immediately discharge\nthe debt, or procure sufficient bondsmen; and one of his quality\nfriends favoured him with this reply to his request:—"

  "content": "“MY DEAR COUNT!\nI am mortally chagrined at the triumph you have furnished to that\nrascally citizen. By the lard! the judge must have been in the terrors\nof cuckoldom, to influence the decision; and the jury a mere herd of\nhorned beasts, to bring in such a barbarous verdict. Egad! at this\nrate, no gentleman will be able to lie with another man’s wife, but at\nthe risk of a cursed prosecution. But to waive this disagreeable\ncircumstance, which you must strive to forget; I declare my\nmortification is still the greater, because I cannot at present supply\nyou with the trifle your present exigency requires; for, to tell you a\nsecret, my own finances are in damnable confusion. But a man of Count\nFathom’s figure and address can never be puzzled for the want of such a\npaltry sum. Adieu, my dear Count! we shall, I suppose, have the\npleasure of seeing you to-morrow at White’s: meanwhile, I have the\nhonour to be, with the most perfect attachment,yours, GRIZZLEGRIN.”The other noble peer, to whom he addressed himself on this occasion,\ncherished the same sentiments of virtue, friendship, and generosity;\nbut his expression was so different, that we shall, for the edification\nof the reader, transcribe his letter in his own words:—“SIR,\nI was never more astonished than at the receipt of your very\nextraordinary billet, wherein you solicit the loan of a thousand\npounds, which you desire may be sent with the bearer on the faith of\nyour parole. Sir, I have no money to send you or lend you; and cannot\nhelp repeating my expressions of surprise at your confidence in making\nsuch a strange and unwarranted demand. ’Tis true, I may have made\nprofessions of friendship, while I looked upon you as a person of\nhonour and good morals; but now that you are convicted of such a\nflagrant violation of the laws of that kingdom where you have been\ntreated with such hospitality and respect, I think myself fully\nabsolved from any such conditional promise, which indeed is never\ninterpreted into any other than a bare compliment. I am sorry you have\ninvolved your character and fortune in such a disagreeable affair, and\nam,Sir, yours, etc.\nTROMPINGTON.”Ferdinand was not such a novice in the world as to be disappointed at\nthese repulses; especially as he had laid very little stress upon the\napplication, which was made by way of an experiment upon the gratitude\nor caprice of those two noblemen, whom he had actually more than once\nobliged with the same sort of assistance which he now solicited, though\nnot to such a considerable amount."

He therefore lent a\ndeaf ear to the most pressing remonstrances of the ambassador, who had\nrecourse to several other merchants, with the same bad success; so that\nthe prisoner, despairing of bail, endeavoured to persuade Ratchcali,\nthat it would be his interest to contribute a thousand pounds towards\nhis discharge, that he might be enabled to quit England with a good\ngrace, and execute his part of the plan they had projected.So powerful was his eloquence on the occasion, and such strength of\nargument did he use, that even the Tyrolese seemed convinced, though\nreluctantly, and agreed to advance the necessary sum upon the bond and\njudgment of our adventurer, who, being disabled from transacting his\nown affairs in person, was obliged to intrust Ratchcali with his keys,\npapers, and power of attorney, under the check and inspection of his\nfaithful Maurice and the solicitor, whose fidelity he bespoke with the\npromise of an ample recompense.CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTTHE BITER IS BIT.Yet, he had no sooner committed his effects to the care of this\ntriumvirate, than his fancy was visited with direful warnings, which\nproduced cold sweats and palpitations, and threw him into such agonies\nof apprehension as he had never known before. He remembered the former\ndesertion of the Tyrolese, the recent villany of the solicitor, and\nrecollected the remarks he had made upon the disposition and character\nof his valet, which evinced him a fit companion for the other two.Alarmed at these reflections, he entreated the bailiff to indulge him\nwith a visit to his own lodgings, and even offered one hundred guineas\nas a gratification for his compliance. But the officer, who had\nformerly lost a considerable sum by the escape of a prisoner, would not\nrun any risk in an affair of such consequence, and our hero was obliged\nto submit to the tortures of his own presaging fears. After he had\nwaited five hours in the most racking impatience, he saw the attorney\nenter with all the marks of hurry, fatigue, and consternation, and\nheard him exclaim, “Good God, have you seen the gentleman?”"

Speak, and keep me no longer in suspense.” “Robbed!” cried\nthe attorney, “the Lord forbid! I hope you can depend upon the person\nyou empowered to receive your jewels and cash? I must own his\nproceedings are a little extraordinary; for after he had rummaged your\nscrutoire, from which, in presence of me and your servant, he took one\nhundred and fifty guineas, a parcel of diamond rings and buckles,\naccording to this here inventory, which I wrote with my own hand, and\nEast India bonds to the tune of five hundred more, we adjourned to\nGarraway’s, where he left me alone, under pretence of going to a broker\nof his acquaintance who lived in the neighbourhood, while the valet, as\nI imagined, waited for us in the alley. Well, sir, he stayed so long,\nthat I began to be uneasy, and at length resolved to send the servant\nin quest of him, but when I went out for that purpose, deuce a servant\nwas to be found; though I in person inquired for him at every alehouse\nwithin half a mile of the place. I then despatched no less than five\nticket porters upon the scent after them, and I myself, by a direction\nfrom the bar-keeper, went to Signior Ratchcali’s lodgings, where, as\nthey told me, he had not been seen since nine o’clock in the morning.\nUpon this intimation, I came directly hither, to give you timely\nnotice, that you may without delay take measures for your own security.\nThe best thing you can do, is to take out writs for apprehending him,\nin the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, and Essex, and I shall put\nthem in the hands of trusty and diligent officers, who will soon ferret\nhim out of his lurking-place, provided he skulks within ten miles of\nthe bills of mortality. To be sure, the job will be expensive; and all\nthese runners must be paid beforehand. But what then? the defendant is\nworth powder, and if we can once secure him, I’ll warrant the\nprosecution will quit cost.”"

  "content": "Fathom was almost choked with concern and resentment at the news of\nthis mischance, so that he could not utter one word until this\nnarrative was finished. Nor was his suspicion confined to the Tyrolese\nand his own lacquey; he considered the solicitor as their accomplice\nand director, and was so much provoked at the latter part of his\nharangue, that his discretion seemed to vanish, and, collaring the\nattorney, “Villain!” said he, “you yourself have been a principal actor\nin this robbery.” Then turning to the bystanders, “and I desire in the\nKing’s name that he may be secured, until I can make oath before a\nmagistrate in support of the charge. If you refuse your assistance in\ndetaining him, I will make immediate application to one of the\nsecretaries of state, who is my particular friend, and he will see\njustice done to all parties.”"

  "content": "At mention of this formidable name, the bailiff and his whole family\nwere in commotion, to obstruct the retreat of the lawyer, who stood\naghast and trembled under the grasp of our adventurer. But, soon as he\nfound himself delivered from this embrace, by the interposition of the\nspectators, and collected his spirits, which had been suddenly\ndissipated by Fathom’s unexpected assault, he began to display one art\nof his occupation, which he always reserved for extraordinary\noccasions. This was the talent of abuse, which he poured forth with\nsuch fluency of opprobrious language, that our hero, smarting as he\nwas, and almost desperate with his loss, deviated from that temperance\nof behaviour which he had hitherto preserved, and snatching up the\npoker, with one stroke opened a deep trench upon the attorney’s skull,\nthat extended from the hind head almost to the upper part of the nose,\nupon each side of which it discharged a sanguine stream.\nNotwithstanding the pain of this application, the solicitor was\ntransported with joy at the sense of the smart, and inwardly\ncongratulated himself upon the appearance of his own blood, which he no\nsooner perceived, than he exclaimed, “I’m a dead man,” and fell upon\nthe floor at full length.Immediate recourse was had to a surgeon in the neighbourhood, who,\nhaving examined the wound, declared there was a dangerous depression of\nthe first table of the skull, and that, if he could save the patient’s\nlife without the application of the trepan, it would be one of the\ngreatest cures that ever were performed. By this time, Fathom’s first\ntransport being overblown, he summoned up his whole resolution, and\nreflected upon his own ruin with that fortitude which had never failed\nhim in the emergencies of his fate. Little disturbed at the prognostic\nof the surgeon, which he considered in the right point of view; “Sir,”\nsaid he, “I am not so unacquainted with the resistance of an attorney’s\nskull, as to believe the chastisement I have bestowed on him will at\nall endanger his life, which is in much greater jeopardy from the hands\nof the common executioner. For, notwithstanding this accident, I am\ndetermined to prosecute the rascal for robbery with the utmost severity\nof the law; and, that I may have a sufficient fund left for that\nprosecution, I shall not at present throw away one farthing in\nunnecessary expense, but insist upon being conveyed to prison without\nfarther delay.”"

  "content": "This declaration was equally unwelcome to the bailiff, surgeon, and\nsolicitor, who, upon the supposition that the Count was a person of\nfortune, and would rather part with an immense sum than incur the\nignominy of a jail, or involve himself in another disgraceful lawsuit,\nhad resolved to fleece him to the utmost of their power. But, now the\nattorney finding him determined to set his fate at defiance, and to\nretort upon him a prosecution, which he had no design to undergo, began\nto repent heartily of the provocation he had given, and to think\nseriously on some method to overcome the obstinacy of the incensed\nforeigner. With this view, while the bailiff conducted him to bed in\nanother apartment, he desired the catchpole to act the part of mediator\nbetween him and the Count, and furnished him with proper instructions\nfor that purpose. Accordingly the landlord, on his return, told Fathom\nthat he was sure the solicitor was not a man for this world; for that\nhe had left him deprived of his senses, and praying to God with great\ndevotion for mercy to his murderer. He then exhorted him, with many\nprotestations of friendship, to compromise the unhappy affair by\nexchanging releases with the attorney before his delirium should be\nknown, otherwise he would bring himself into a most dangerous\npremunire, whether the plaintiff should die of his wound, or live to\nprosecute him for assault. “And with regard to your charge of robbery\nagainst him,” said he, “as it is no more than a base suspicion,\nunsupported by the least shadow of evidence, the bill would be thrown\nout, and then he might sue you for damages. I therefore, out of pure\nfriendship and good-nature, advise you to compromise the affair, and,\nif you think proper, will endeavour to bring about a mutual release.”Our hero, whose passion was by this time pretty well cooled, saw reason\nfor assenting to the proposal; upon which the deed was immediately\nexecuted, the mediator’s bill was discharged, and Ferdinand conveyed in\nan hackney-coach to prison, after he had empowered his own landlord to\ndischarge his servants, and convert his effects into ready money. Thus,\nhe saw himself, in the course of a few hours, deprived of his\nreputation, rank, liberty, and friends; and his fortune reduced from\ntwo thousand pounds to something less than two hundred, fifty of which\nhe had carried to jail in his pocket.END OF VOL.

And, d’ye\nhear, send Ragged-head with five pounds of potatoes for Major\nMacleaver’s supper, and let him have what drink he wants; the fat widow\ngentlewoman from Pimlico has promised to quit his score. Sir Mungo\nBarebones may have some hasty pudding and small beer, though I don’t\nexpect to see his coin, no more than to receive the eighteen pence I\nlaid out for a pair of breeches to his backside—what then? he’s a quiet\nsort of a body, and a great scholar, and it was a scandal to the place\nto see him going about in that naked condition. As for the mad\nFrenchman with the beard, if you give him so much as a cheese-paring,\nyou b—ch, I’ll send you back to the hole, among your old companions; an\nimpudent dog! I’ll teach him to draw his sword upon the governor of an\nEnglish county jail. What! I suppose he thought he had to do with a\nFrench hang-tang-dang, rabbit him! he shall eat his white feather,\nbefore I give him credit for a morsel of bread.”Although our adventurer was very little disposed, at this juncture, to\nmake observations foreign to his own affairs, he could not help taking\nnotice of these extraordinary injunctions; especially those concerning\nthe person who was entitled king, whom, however, he supposed to be some\nprisoner elected as the magistrate by the joint suffrage of his\nfellows. Having taken possession of his chamber, which he rented at\nfive shillings a week, and being ill at ease in his own thoughts, he\nforthwith secured his door, undressed, and went to bed, in which,\nthough it was none of the most elegant or inviting couches, he enjoyed\nprofound repose after the accumulated fatigues and mortifications of\nthe day. Next morning, after breakfast, the keeper entered his\napartment, and gave him to understand, that the gentlemen under his\ncare, having heard of the Count’s arrival, had deputed one of their\nnumber to wait upon him with the compliments of condolence suitable to\nthe occasion, and invite him to become a member of their society. Our\nhero could not politely dispense with this instance of civility, and\ntheir ambassador being instantly introduced by the name of Captain\nMinikin, saluted him with great solemnity."

  "content": "This was a person equally remarkable for his extraordinary figure and\naddress; his age seemed to border upon forty, his stature amounted to\nfive feet, his visage was long, meagre, and weather-beaten, and his\naspect, though not quite rueful, exhibited a certain formality, which\nwas the result of care and conscious importance. He was very little\nencumbered with flesh and blood; yet what body he had was well\nproportioned, his limbs were elegantly turned, and by his carriage he\nwas well entitled to that compliment which we pay to any person when we\nsay he has very much the air of a gentleman. There was also an evident\nsingularity in his dress, which, though intended as an improvement,\nappeared to be an extravagant exaggeration of the mode, and at once\nevinced him an original to the discerning eyes of our adventurer, who\nreceived him with his usual complaisance, and made a very eloquent\nacknowledgment of the honour and satisfaction he received from the\nvisit of the representative, and the hospitality of his constituents.\nThe captain’s peculiarities were not confined to his external\nappearance; for his voice resembled the sound of a bassoon, or the\naggregate hum of a whole bee-hive, and his discourse was almost nothing\nelse than a series of quotations from the English poets, interlarded\nwith French phrases, which he retained for their significance, on the\nrecommendation of his friends, being himself unacquainted with that or\nany other outlandish tongue.Fathom, finding this gentleman of a very communicative disposition,\nthought he could not have a fairer opportunity of learning the history\nof his fellow-prisoners; and, turning the conversation on that subject,\nwas not disappointed in his expectation. “I don’t doubt, sir,” said he,\nwith the utmost solemnity of declamation, “but you look with horror\nupon every object that surrounds you in this uncomfortable place; but,\nnevertheless, here are some, who, as my friend Shakespeare has it, have\nseen better days, and have with holy bell been knolled to church; and\nsat at good men’s feasts, and wiped their eyes of drops that sacred\npity hath engendered. You must know, sir, that, exclusive of the\ncanaille, or the profanum vulgus, as they are styled by Horace, there\nare several small communities in the jail, consisting of people who are\nattracted by the manners and dispositions of each other; for this\nplace, sir, is quite a microcosm, and as the great world, so is this, a\nstage, and all the men and women merely players. For my own part, sir,\nI have always made it a maxim to associate with the best of company I\ncan find. Not that I pretend to boast of my family or extraction;\nbecause, you know, as the poet says, Vix ea nostra voco. My father,\n’tis true, was a man that piqued himself upon his pedigree, as well as\nupon his politesse and personal merit; for he had been a very old\nofficer in the army, and I myself may say I was born with a spontoon in\nmy hand. Sir, I have had the honour to serve his Majesty these twenty\nyears, and have been bandied about in the course of duty through all\nthe British plantations, and you see the recompense of all my service.\nBut this is a disagreeable subject, and therefore I shall waive it;\nhowever, as Butler observes:My only comfort is, that now\nMy dubbolt fortune is so low,\nThat either it must quickly end,\nOr turn about again and mend."

Heu!\nquantum mutatus ab illo. It is not my business to censure the conduct\nof my superiors; but I always speak my mind in a cavalier manner, and\nas, according to the Spectator, talking to a friend is no more than\nthinking aloud, entre nous, his Corsican majesty has been scurvily\ntreated by a certain administration. Be that as it will, he is a\npersonage of a very portly appearance, and is quite master of the\nbienseance. Besides, they will find it their interest to have recourse\nagain to his alliance; and in that case some of us may expect to profit\nby his restoration. But few words are best.“He that maintains the second rank in our assembly is one Major\nMacleaver, an Irish gentleman, who has served abroad; a soldier of\nfortune, sir, a man of unquestionable honour and courage, but a little\noverbearing, in consequence of his knowledge and experience. He is a\nperson of good address,—to be sure, and quite free of the mauvaise\nhonte, and he may have seen a good deal of service. But what then?\nother people may be as good as he, though they have not had such\nopportunities; if he speaks five or six languages, he does not pretend\nto any taste in the liberal arts, which are the criterion of an\naccomplished gentleman.“The next is Sir Mungo Barebones, the representative of a very ancient\nfamily in the north; his affairs are very much deranged, but he is a\ngentleman of great probity and learning, and at present engaged in a\nvery grand scheme, which, if he can bring it to bear, will render him\nfamous to all posterity; no less than the conversion of the Jews and\nthe Gentiles. The project, I own, looks chimerical to one who has not\nconversed with the author; but, in my opinion, he has clearly\ndemonstrated, from an anagrammatical analysis of a certain Hebrew word,\nthat his present Majesty, whom God preserve, is the person pointed at\nin Scripture as the temporal Messiah of the Jews; and, if he could once\nraise by subscription such a trifling sum as twelve hundred thousand\npounds, I make no doubt but he would accomplish his aim, vast and\nromantic as it seems to be."

The king has been obliged to exert his\nauthority over him more than once, by ordering him into close\nconfinement, for which he was so rash as to send his majesty a\nchallenge; but he afterwards made his submission, and was again taken\ninto favour. The truth is, I believe his brain is a little disordered,\nand, he being a stranger, we overlook his extravagancies.“Sir, we shall think ourselves happy in your accession to our society.\nYou will be under no sort of restraint; for, though we dine at one\ntable, every individual calls and pays for his own mess. Our\nconversation, such as it is, will not, I hope, be disagreeable; and\nthough we have not opportunities of breathing the pure Arcadian air,\nand cannot, ‘under the shade of melancholy boughs, lose and neglect the\ncreeping hours of time,’ we may enjoy ourselves over a glass of punch\nor a dish of tea.

He thanked\nthe captain in particular for his obliging offers, and begged he would\nbe so good as to present his respects to the society, of which he\nlonged to be a member. It was determined, therefore, that Minikin\nshould return in an hour, when the Count would be dressed, in order to\nconduct him into the presence of his majesty; and he had already taken\nhis leave for the present, when all of a sudden he came back, and\ntaking hold of a waistcoat that lay upon a chair, “Sir,” said he, “give\nme leave to look at that fringe; I think it is the most elegant\nknitting I ever saw. But pray, sir, are not these quite out of fashion?\nI thought plain silk, such as this that I wear, had been the mode, with\nthe pockets very low.” Before Fathom had time to make any sort of\nreply, he took notice of his hat and pumps; the first of which, he\nsaid, was too narrow in the brims, and the last an inch too low in the\nheels. Indeed, they formed a remarkable contrast with his own; for,\nexclusive of the fashion of the cock, which resembled the form of a\nRoman galley, the brim of his hat, if properly spread, would have\nprojected a shade sufficient to shelter a whole file of musketeers from\nthe heat of a summer’s sun; and the heels of his shoes were so high as\nto raise his feet three inches at least from the surface of the earth.Having made these observations, for the credit of his taste, he\nretired, and returning at the time appointed, accompanied Ferdinand to\nthe apartment of the king, at the doors of which their ears were\ninvaded with a strange sound, being that of a human voice imitating the\nnoise of a drum. The captain, hearing this alarm, made a full stop,\nand, giving the Count to understand that his majesty was busy, begged\nhe would not take it amiss, if the introduction should be delayed for a\nfew moments. Fathom, curious to know the meaning of what he had heard,\napplied to his guide for information, and learned that the king and the\nmajor, whom he had nominated to the post of his general-in-chief, were\nemployed in landing troops upon the Genoese territory; that is, that\nthey were settling beforehand the manner of their disembarkation.He then, by the direction of his conductor, reconnoitred them through\nthe keyhole, and perceived the sovereign and his minister sitting on\nopposite sides of a deal board table, covered with a large chart or\nmap, upon which he saw a great number of mussel and oyster shells\nranged in a certain order, and, at a little distance, several regular\nsquares and columns made of cards cut in small pieces. The prince\nhimself, whose eyes were reinforced by spectacles, surveyed this\narmament with great attention, while the general put the whole in\naction, and conducted their motions by beat of drum. The mussel-shells,\naccording to Minikin’s explanation, represented the transports, the\noyster-shells were considered as the men-of-war that covered the troops\nin landing, and the pieces of card exhibited the different bodies into\nwhich the army was formed upon its disembarkation."

  "content": "As an affair of such consequence could not be transacted without\nopposition, they had provided divers ambuscades, consisting of the\nenemy, whom they represented by grey peas; and accordingly General\nMacleaver, perceiving the said grey peas marching along shore to attack\nhis forces before they could be drawn up in battalia, thus addressed\nhimself to the oyster-shells, in an audible voice:—“You men-of-war,\ndon’t you see the front of the enemy advancing, and the rest of the\ndetachment following out of sight? Arrah! the devil burn you, why don’t\nyou come ashore and open your batteries?” So saying, he pushed the\nshells towards the breach, performed the cannonading with his voice,\nthe grey peas were soon put in confusion, the general was beat, the\ncards marched forwards in order of battle, and the enemy having\nretreated with great precipitation, they took possession of their\nground without farther difficulty.CHAPTER FORTYHE CONTEMPLATES MAJESTY AND ITS SATELLITES IN ECLIPSE.This expedition being happily finished, General Macleaver put the whole\narmy, navy, transports, and scene of action into a canvas bag, the\nprince unsaddled his nose, and Captain Minikin being admitted, our hero\nwas introduced in form. Very gracious was the reception he met with\nfrom his majesty, who, with a most princely demeanour, welcomed him to\ncourt, and even seated him on his right hand, in token of particular\nregard. True it is, this presence-chamber was not so superb, nor the\nappearance of the king so magnificent, as to render such an honour\nintoxicating to any person of our hero’s coolness and discretion. In\nlieu of tapestry, the apartment was hung with halfpenny ballads, a\ntruckle-bed without curtains supplied the place of a canopy, and\ninstead of a crown his majesty wore a woollen night-cap. Yet, in spite\nof these disadvantages, there was an air of dignity in his deportment,\nand a nice physiognomist would have perceived something majestic in the\nfeatures of his countenance."

  "content": "He was certainly a personage of very prepossessing mien; his manners\nwere engaging, his conversation agreeable, and any man whose heart was\nsubject to the meltings of humanity would have deplored his distress,\nand looked upon him as a most pathetic instance of that miserable\nreverse to which all human grandeur is exposed. His fall was even\ngreater than that of Belisarius, who, after having obtained many\nglorious victories over the enemies of his country, is said to have\nbeen reduced to such extremity of indigence, that, in his old age, when\nhe was deprived of his eyesight, he sat upon the highway like a common\nmendicant, imploring the charity of passengers in the piteous\nexclamation of Date obolum Belisario; that is, “Spare a farthing to\nyour poor old soldier Belisarius.” I say, this general’s disgrace was\nnot so remarkable as that of Theodore, because he was the servant of\nJustinian, consequently his fortune depended upon the nod of that\nemperor; whereas the other actually possessed the throne of sovereignty\nby the best of all titles, namely, the unanimous election of the people\nover whom he reigned; and attracted the eyes of all Europe, by the\nefforts he made in breaking the bands of oppression, and vindicating\nthat liberty which is the birthright of man.The English of former days, alike renowned for generosity and valour,\ntreated those hostile princes, whose fate it was to wear their chains,\nwith such delicacy of benevolence, as even dispelled the horrors of\ncaptivity; but their posterity of this refined age feel no compunction\nat seeing an unfortunate monarch, their former friend, ally, and\npartisan, languish amidst the miseries of a loathsome jail, for a\npaltry debt contracted in their own service. But, moralising apart, our\nhero had not long conversed with this extraordinary debtor, who in his\npresent condition assumed no other title than that of Baron, than he\nperceived in him a spirit of Quixotism, which all his experience,\ntogether with the vicissitudes of his fortune, had not been able to\novercome. Not that his ideas soared to such a pitch of extravagant hope\nas that which took possession of his messmates, who frequently\nquarrelled one with another about the degrees of favour to which they\nshould be entitled after the king’s restoration; but he firmly believed\nthat affairs would speedily take such a turn in Italy, as would point\nout to the English court the expediency of employing him again; and his\npersuasion seemed to support him against every species of poverty and\nmortification.While they were busy in trimming the balance of power on the other side\nof the Alps, their deliberations were interrupted by the arrival of a\nscullion, who came to receive their orders touching the bill of fare\nfor dinner, and his majesty found much more difficulty in settling this\nimportant concern, than in compromising all the differences between the\nEmperor and the Queen of Spain. At length, however, General Macleaver\nundertook the office of purveyor for his prince; Captain Minikin\ninsisted upon treating the Count; and in a little time the table was\ncovered with a cloth, which, for the sake of my delicate readers, I\nwill not attempt to describe."

  "content": "At this period they were joined by Sir Mungo Barebones, who, having\nfound means to purchase a couple of mutton chops, had cooked a mess of\nbroth, which he now brought in a saucepan to the general rendezvous.\nThis was the most remarkable object which had hitherto presented itself\nto the eyes of Fathom. Being naturally of a meagre habit, he was, by\nindigence and hard study, wore almost to the bone, and so bended\ntowards the earth, that in walking his body described at least 150\ndegrees of a circle. The want of stockings and shoes he supplied with a\njockey straight boot and an half jack. His thighs and middle were cased\nin a monstrous pair of brown trunk breeches, which the keeper bought\nfor his use from the executor of a Dutch seaman who had lately died in\nthe jail. His shirt retained no signs of its original colour, his body\nwas shrouded in an old greasy tattered plaid nightgown; a blue and\nwhite handkerchief surrounded his head, and his looks betokened that\nimmense load of care which he had voluntarily incurred for the eternal\nsalvation of sinners. Yet this figure, uncouth as it was, made his\ncompliments to our adventurer in terms of the most elegant address,\nand, in the course of conversation, disclosed a great fund of valuable\nknowledge. He had appeared in the great world, and borne divers offices\nof dignity and trust with universal applause. His courage was\nundoubted, his morals were unimpeached, and his person held in great\nveneration and esteem; when his evil genius engaged him in the study of\nHebrew, and the mysteries of the Jewish religion, which fairly\ndisordered his brain, and rendered him incapable of managing his\ntemporal affairs. When he ought to have been employed in the functions\nof his post, he was always wrapt in visionary conferences with Moses on\nthe Mount; rather than regulate the economy of his household, he chose\nto exert his endeavours in settling the precise meaning of the word\nElohim; and having discovered that now the period was come, when the\nJews and Gentiles would be converted, he postponed every other\nconsideration, in order to facilitate that great and glorious event."

  "content": "By this time Ferdinand had seen every member of the club, except the\nFrench chevalier, who seemed to be quite neglected by the society; for\nhis name was not once mentioned during this communication, and they sat\ndown to dinner, without asking whether he was dead or alive. The king\nregaled himself with a plate of ox-cheek; the major, who complained\nthat his appetite had forsaken him, amused himself with some forty hard\neggs, malaxed with salt butter; the knight indulged upon his soup and\nbouilli, and the captain entertained our adventurer with a neck of veal\nroasted with potatoes; but before Fathom could make use of his knife\nand fork, he was summoned to the door, where he found the chevalier in\ngreat agitation, his eyes sparkling like coals of fire.Our hero was not a little surprised at this apparition, who, having\nasked pardon for the freedom he had used, observed, that, understanding\nthe Count was a foreigner, he could not dispense with appealing to him\nconcerning an outrage he had suffered from the keeper, who, without any\nregard to his rank or misfortunes, had been base enough to refuse him\ncredit for a few necessaries, until he could have a remittance from his\nsteward in France; he therefore conjured Count Fathom, as a stranger\nand nobleman like himself, to be the messenger of defiance, which he\nresolved to send to that brutal jailor, that, for the future, he might\nlearn to make proper distinctions in the exercise of his function."

Though his age did not exceed thirty\nyears, his beard, which was of a brindled hue, flowed down, like\nAaron’s, to his middle. Upon his legs he wore red stockings rolled up\nover the joint of the knee, his breeches were of blue drab, with vellum\nbutton-holes, and garters of gold lace, his waistcoat of scarlet, his\ncoat of rusty black cloth, his hair, twisted into a ramilie, hung down\nto his rump, of the colour of jet, and his hat was adorned with a white\nfeather.This original had formed many ingenious schemes to increase the glory\nand grandeur of France, but was discouraged by Cardinal Fleury, who, in\nall appearance, jealous of his great talents, not only rejected his\nprojects, but even sent him to prison, on pretence of being offended at\nhis impertinence. Perceiving that, like the prophet, he had no honour\nin his own country, he no sooner obtained his release, than he retired\nto England, where he was prompted by his philanthropy to propose an\nexpedient to our ministry, which would have saved a vast effusion of\nblood and treasure; this was an agreement between the Queen of Hungary\nand the late Emperor, to decide their pretensions by a single combat;\nin which case he offered himself as the Bavarian champion; but in this\nendeavour he also proved unsuccessful. Then turning his attention to\nthe delights of poetry, he became so enamoured of the muse, that he\nneglected every other consideration, and she as usual gradually\nconducted him to the author’s never-failing goal—a place of rest\nappointed for all those sinners whom the profane love of poesy hath led\nastray.CHAPTER FORTY-ONEONE QUARREL IS COMPROMISED, AND ANOTHER DECIDED BY UNUSUAL ARMS."

  "content": "Among other topics of conversation that were discussed at this genial\nmeeting, Sir Mungo’s scheme was brought upon the carpet by his majesty,\nwho was graciously pleased to ask how his subscription filled? To this\ninterrogation the knight answered, that he met with great opposition\nfrom a spirit of levity and self-conceit, which seemed to prevail in\nthis generation, but that no difficulties should discourage him from\npersevering in his duty; and he trusted in God, that, in a very little\ntime, he should be able to confute and overthrow the false philosophy\nof the moderns, and to restore the writings of Moses to that\npre-eminence and veneration which is due to an inspired author. He\nspoke of the immortal Newton with infinite contempt, and undertook to\nextract from the Pentateuch a system of chronology which would\nascertain the progress of time since the fourth day of the creation to\nthe present hour, with such exactness, that not one vibration of a\npendulum should be lost; nay, he affirmed that the perfection of all\narts and sciences might be attained by studying these secret memoirs,\nand that he himself did not despair of learning from them the art of\ntransmuting baser metals into gold.The chevalier, though he did not pretend to contradict these\nassertions, was too much attached to his own religion to acquiesce in\nthe knight’s project of converting the Jews and the Gentiles to the\nProtestant heresy, which, he said, God Almighty would never suffer to\ntriumph over the interests of his own Holy Catholic Church. This\nobjection produced abundance of altercation between two very unequal\ndisputants; and the Frenchman, finding himself puzzled by the learning\nof his antagonist, had recourse to the argumentum ad hominem, by laying\nhis hand upon his sword, and declaring that he was ready to lose the\nlast drop of his blood in opposition to such a damnable scheme.Sir Mungo, though in all appearance reduced to the last stage of animal\nexistence, no sooner heard this epithet applied to his plan, than his\neyes gleamed like lightning, he sprung from his seat with the agility\nof a grasshopper, and, darting himself out at the door like an arrow\nfrom a bow, reappeared in a moment with a long rusty weapon, which\nmight have been shown among a collection of rarities as the sword of\nGuy Earl of Warwick. This implement he brandished over the chevalier’s\nhead with the dexterity of an old prize-fighter, exclaiming, in the\nFrench language, “Thou art a profane wretch marked out for the\nvengeance of Heaven, whose unworthy minister I am, and here thou shalt\nfall by the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.”The chevalier, unterrified by this dreadful salutation, desired he\nwould accompany him to a more convenient place; and the world might\nhave been deprived of one or both these knights-errant, had not General\nMacleaver, at the desire of his majesty, interposed, and found means to\nbring matters to an accommodation."

I have always admired that speech of Hotspur in the first part of\nHenry the Fourth:By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,\nTo pluck bright honour from the pale-fac’d moon;\nOr dive into the bottom of the deep,\nWhere fathom-line could never touch the ground,\nAnd pluck up drowned honour by the locks—“There is a boldness and ease in the expression, and the images are\nvery picturesque. But, without any further preamble, pray, sir, give me\nleave to ask how long you have been acquainted with those ladies who\ndrank tea with us this afternoon. You’ll forgive the question, sir,\nwhen I tell you that Major Macleaver introduced Mrs. Minikin to them as\nto ladies of character, and, I don’t know how, sir, I have a sort of\npresentiment that my wife has been imposed upon. Perhaps I may be\nmistaken, and God grant I may. But there was a je ne sais quoi in their\nbehaviour to-day, which begins to alarm my suspicion. Sir, I have\nnothing but my reputation to depend upon, and I hope you will excuse\nme, when I earnestly beg to know what rank they maintain in life.”Fathom, without minding the consequence, told him, with a simper, that\nhe knew them to be very good-natured ladies, who devoted themselves to\nthe happiness of mankind. This explanation had no sooner escaped from\nhis lips, than the captain’s face began to glow with indignation, his\neyes seemed bursting from their spheres, he swelled to twice his\nnatural dimensions, and, raising himself on his tiptoes, pronounced, in\na strain that emulated thunder, “Blood! sir, you seem to make very\nlight of the matter, but it is no joke to me, I’ll assure you, and\nMacleaver shall see that I am not to be affronted with impunity. Sir, I\nshall take it as a singular favour if you will be the bearer of a\nbillet to him, which I shall write in three words; nay, sir, you must\ngive me leave to insist upon it, as you are the only gentleman of our\nmess whom I can intrust with an affair of this nature.”"

I therefore\ndemand such satisfaction as a soldier ought to receive, and expect you\nwill adjust with my friend Count Fathom the terms upon which you shall\nbe met by the much injuredGOLIAH MINIKIN.”This morceau being sealed and directed, was forthwith carried by our\nadventurer to the lodgings of the major, who had by this time retired\nto rest, but hearing the Count’s voice, he got up and opened the door\nin cuerpo, to the astonishment of Ferdinand, who had never before seen\nsuch an Herculean figure. He made an apology for receiving the Count in\nhis birthday suit, to which he said he was reduced by the heat of his\nconstitution, though he might have assigned a more adequate cause, by\nowning that his shirt was in the hands of his washerwoman; then\nshrouding himself in a blanket, desired to know what had procured him\nthe honour of such an extraordinary visit. He read the letter with\ngreat composure, like a man accustomed to such intercourse; then\naddressing himself to the bearer, “I will be after diverting the\ngentleman,” said he, “in any manner he shall think proper; but, by\nJesus, this is no place for such amusements, because, as you well know,\nmy dear Count, if both should be killed by the chance of war, neither\nof us will be able to escape, and after the breath is out of his body,\nhe will make but a sorry excuse to his family and friends. But that is\nno concern of mine, and therefore I am ready to please him in his own\nway.”"
