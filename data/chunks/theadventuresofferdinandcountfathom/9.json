  "content": "This account, which totally overthrew the other’s doctrine, was so\nextremely agreeable to the audience, that the testy doctor lost his\ntemper, and gave them to understand, without preamble, that he must be\na person wholly ignorant of natural philosophy, who could invent such a\nridiculous system, and they involved in worse than an Egyptian fog,\nthat could not at once discern its weakness and absurdity. This\ndeclaration introduced a dispute, which was unanimously determined in\nfavour of our adventurer. On all such occasions the stream of prejudice\nruns against the physician, even though his antagonist has nothing to\nrecommend himself to the favour of the spectators; and this decision\ndepends upon divers considerations. In the first place, there is a\ncontinual war carried on against the learned professions, by all those\nwho, conscious of their own ignorance, seek to level the reputation of\ntheir superiors with their own. Secondly, in all disputes upon physic\nthat happen betwixt a person who really understands the art, and an\nilliterate pretender, the arguments of the first will seem obscure and\nunintelligible to those who are unacquainted with the previous systems\non which they are built; while the other’s theory, derived from common\nnotions, and superficial observation, will be more agreeable, because\nbetter adapted to the comprehension of the hearers. Thirdly, the\njudgment of the multitude is apt to be biassed by that surprise which\nis the effect of seeing an artist foiled at his own weapons, by one who\nengages him only for amusement.Fathom, besides these advantages, was blessed with a flow of language,\nan elegant address, a polite and self-denying style of argumentation,\ntogether with a temper not to be ruffled; so that the victory could not\nlong waver between him and the physician, to whom he was infinitely\nsuperior in every acquisition but that of solid learning, of which the\njudges had no idea. This contest was not only glorious but profitable\nto our adventurer, who grew into such request in his medical capacity,\nthat the poor doctor was utterly deserted by his patients, and Fathom’s\nadvice solicited by every valetudinarian in the place; nor did he\nforfeit the character he thus acquired by any miscarriages in his\npractice. Being but little conversant with the materia medica, the\ncircle of his prescriptions was very small; his chief study was to\navoid all drugs of rough operation and uncertain effect, and to\nadminister such only as should be agreeable to the palate, without\ndoing violence to the constitution. Such a physician could not but be\nagreeable to people of all dispositions; and, as most of the patients\nwere in some shape hypochondriac, the power of imagination,\nco-operating with his remedies, often effected a cure."

  "content": "On the whole, it became the fashion to consult the Count in all\ndistempers, and his reputation would have had its run, though the death\nof every patient had given the lie to his pretensions. But empty fame\nwas not the sole fruit of his success. Though no person would presume\nto affront this noble graduate with a fee, they did not fail to\nmanifest their gratitude by some more valuable present. Every day some\nsuperb piece of china, curious snuffbox, or jewel, was pressed upon\nhim; so that, at the end of the season, he could almost have furnished\na toyshop with the acknowledgments he had received. Not only his\navarice, but his pleasure, was gratified in the course of his medical\nadministration. He enjoyed free access, egress, and regress with all\nthe females at the well, and no matron scrupled to put her daughter\nunder his care and direction. These opportunities could not be lost\nupon a man of his intriguing genius; though he conducted his amours\nwith such discretion, that, during the whole season, no lady’s\ncharacter suffered on his account, yet he was highly fortunate in his\naddresses, and we may venture to affirm, that the reproach of\nbarrenness was more than once removed by the vigour of his endeavours.CHAPTER THIRTY-SIXHE IS SMITTEN WITH THE CHARMS OF A FEMALE ADVENTURER, WHOSE ALLUREMENTS\nSUBJECT HIM TO A NEW VICISSITUDE OF FORTUNE.Among those who were distinguished by his gallantry was the young wife\nof an old citizen of London, who had granted her permission to reside\nat the hot well for the benefit of her health, under the eye and\ninspection of his own sister, who was a maiden of fifty years. The\npupil, whose name was Mrs. Trapwell, though low in stature, was finely\nshaped, her countenance engaging, though her complexion was brown, her\nhair in colour rivalled the raven’s back, and her eyes emulated the\nlustre of the diamond. Fathom had been struck with her first\nappearance; but found it impracticable to elude the vigilance of her\nduenna, so as to make a declaration of his flame; until she herself,\nguessing the situation of his thoughts, and not displeased with the\ndiscovery, thought proper to furnish him with the opportunity he\nwanted, by counterfeiting an indisposition, for the cure of which she\nknew his advice would be implored. This was the beginning of an\nacquaintance, which was soon improved to his wish; and so well did she\nmanage her attractions, as in some measure to fix the inconstancy of\nhis disposition; for, at the end of the season, his passion was not\nsated; and they concerted the means of continuing their commerce, even\nafter their return to London."

  "content": "This intercourse effectually answered the purpose of the husband, who\nhad been decoyed into matrimony by the cunning of his spouse, whom he\nhad privately kept as a concubine before marriage. Conscious of her own\nprecarious situation, she had resolved to impose upon the infirmities\nof Trapwell, and, feigning herself pregnant, gave him to understand she\ncould no longer conceal her condition from the knowledge of her\nbrother, who was an officer in the army, and of such violent passions,\nthat, should he once discover her backsliding, he would undoubtedly\nwipe away the stains of his family dishonour with her own blood, as\nwell as that of her keeper. The citizen, to prevent such a catastrophe,\ntook her to wife; but soon after perceiving the trick which had been\nplayed upon him, set his invention at work, and at length contrived a\nscheme which he thought would enable him, not only to retrieve his\nliberty, but also indemnify himself for the mortification he had\nundergone.Far from creating any domestic disturbance, by upbraiding her with her\nfinesse, he seemed perfectly well pleased with his acquisition; and, as\nhe knew her void of any principle, and extremely addicted to pleasure,\nhe chose proper occasions to insinuate, that she might gratify her own\ninclination, and at the same time turn her beauty to good account. She\njoyfully listened to these remonstrances, and, in consequence of their\nmutual agreement, she repaired to Bristol Spring, on pretence of an ill\nstate of health, accompanied by her sister-in-law, whom they did not\nthink proper to intrust with the real motive of her journey. Fathom’s\nperson was agreeable, and his finances supposed to be in flourishing\norder; therefore, she selected him from the herd of gallants, as a\nproper sacrifice to the powers which she adored; and, on her arrival in\nLondon, made her husband acquainted with the importance of her\nconquest.Trapwell overwhelmed her with caresses and praise for her discreet and\ndutiful conduct, and faithfully promised that she should pocket in her\nown privy purse one-half of the spoils that should be gathered from her\ngallant, whom she therefore undertook to betray, after he had swore, in\nthe most solemn manner, that his intention was not to bring the affair\nto a public trial, which would redound to his own disgrace, but to\nextort a round sum of money from the Count, by way of composition.\nConfiding in this protestation, she in a few days gave him intelligence\nof an assignation she had made with our adventurer, at a certain bagnio\nnear Covent Garden; upon which he secured the assistance of a\nparticular friend and his own journeyman, with whom, and a constable,\nhe repaired to the place of rendezvous, where he waited in an adjoining\nroom, according to the directions of his virtuous spouse, until she\nmade the preconcerted signal of hemming three times aloud, when he and\nhis associates rushed into the chamber and surprised our hero in bed\nwith his inamorata."

  "content": "The lady on this occasion acted her part to a miracle; she screamed at\ntheir approach; and, after an exclamation of “Ruined and undone!”\nfainted away in the arms of her spouse, who had by this time seized her\nby the shoulders, and begun to upbraid her with her infidelity and\nguilt. As for Fathom, his affliction was unutterable, when he found\nhimself discovered in that situation, and made prisoner by the two\nassistants, who had pinioned him in such a manner, that he could not\nstir, much less accomplish an escape. All his ingenuity and presence of\nmind seemed to forsake him in this emergency. The horrors of an English\njury overspread his imagination; for he at once perceived that the toil\ninto which he had fallen was laid for the purpose; consequently he took\nit for granted that there would be no deficiency in point of evidence.\nSoon as he recollected himself, he begged that no violence might be\noffered to his person, and entreated the husband to favour him with a\nconference, in which the affair might be compromised, without prejudice\nto the reputation of either.At first Trapwell breathed nothing but implacable revenge, but, by the\npersuasion of his friends, after he had sent home his wife in a chair,\nhe was prevailed upon to hear the proposals of the delinquent, who\nhaving assured him, by way of apology, that he had always believed the\nlady was a widow, made him an offer of five hundred pounds, as an\natonement for the injury he had sustained. This being a sum no ways\nadequate to the expectation of the citizen, who looked upon the Count\nas possessor of an immense estate, he rejected the terms with disdain,\nand made instant application to a judge, from whom he obtained a\nwarrant for securing his person till the day of trial. Indeed, in this\ncase, money was but a secondary consideration with Trapwell, whose\nchief aim was to be legally divorced from a woman he detested.\nTherefore there was no remedy for the unhappy Count, who in vain\noffered to double the sum. He found himself reduced to the bitter\nalternative of procuring immediate bail, or going directly to Newgate.In this dilemma he sent a messenger to his friend Ratchcali, whose\ncountenance fell when he understood the Count’s condition; nor would he\nopen his mouth in the style of consolation, until he had consulted a\ncertain solicitor of his acquaintance, who assured him the law abounded\nwith such resources as would infallibly screen the defendant, had the\nfact been still more palpable than it was. He said there was great\npresumption to believe the Count had fallen a sacrifice to a\nconspiracy, which by some means or other would be detected; and, in\nthat case, the plaintiff might obtain one shilling in lieu of damages.\nIf that dependence should fail, he hinted that, in all probability, the\nwitnesses were not incorruptible; or, should they prove to be so, one\nman’s oath was as good as another’s; and, thank Heaven, there was no\ndearth of evidence, provided money could be found to answer the\nnecessary occasions."

  "content": "Ratchcali, comforted by these insinuations, and dreading the resentment\nof our adventurer, who, in his despair, might punish him severely for\nhis want of friendship, by some precipitate explanation of the commerce\nthey had carried on; moved, I say, by these considerations, and\nmoreover tempted with the prospect of continuing to reap the advantages\nresulting from their conjunction, he and another person of credit with\nwhom he largely dealt in jewels, condescended to become sureties for\nthe appearance of Fathom, who was accordingly admitted to bail. Not but\nthat the Tyrolese knew Ferdinand too well to confide in his parole. He\ndepended chiefly upon his ideas of self-interest, which, he thought,\nwould persuade him to risk the uncertain issue of a trial, rather than\nquit the field before the harvest was half over; and he was resolved to\nmake his own retreat without ceremony, should our hero be unwise enough\nto abandon his bail.Such an adventure could not long lie concealed from the notice of the\npublic, even if both parties had been at pains to suppress the\ncircumstances. But the plaintiff, far from seeking to cover, affected\nto complain loudly of his misfortune, that he might interest his\nneighbours in his behalf, and raise a spirit of rancour and animosity,\nto influence the jury against this insolent foreigner, who had come\nover into England to debauch our wives and deflower our daughters;\nwhile he employed a formidable band of lawyers to support the\nindictment, which he laid at ten thousand pounds damages.Meanwhile, Fathom and his associate did not fail to take all proper\nmeasures for his defence; they retained a powerful bar of counsel, and\nthe solicitor was supplied with one hundred pounds after another, to\nanswer the expense of secret service; still assuring his clients that\neverything was in an excellent train, and that his adversary would gain\nnothing but shame and confusion of face. Nevertheless, there was a\nnecessity for postponing the trial, on account of a material evidence,\nwho, though he wavered, was not yet quite brought over; and the\nattorney found means to put off the decision from term to term, until\nthere was no quibble left for further delay. While this suit was\ndepending, our hero continued to move in his usual sphere; nor did the\nreport of his situation at all operate to his disadvantage in the\npolite world; on the contrary, it added a fresh plume to his character,\nin the eyes of all those who were not before acquainted with the\ntriumphs of his gallantry. Notwithstanding this countenance of his\nfriends, he himself considered the affair in a very serious light; and\nperceiving that, at any rate, he must be a considerable loser, he\nresolved to double his assiduity in trade, that he might be the more\nable to afford the extraordinary expense to which he was subjected.CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENFRESH CAUSE FOR EXERTING HIS EQUANIMITY AND FORTITUDE."

  "content": "The reader may have observed, that Fathom, with all his circumspection,\nhad a weak side, which exposed him to sundry mischances; this was his\ncovetousness, which on some occasions became too hard for his\ndiscretion. At this period of time it was, by the circumstances of his\nsituation, inflamed to a degree of rapacity. He was now prevailed upon\nto take a hand at whist or piquet, and even to wield the hazard-box;\nthough he had hitherto declared himself an irreconcilable enemy to all\nsorts of play; and so uncommon was his success and dexterity at these\nexercises, as to surprise his acquaintance, and arouse the suspicion of\nsome people, who repined at his prosperity.But in nothing was his conduct more inexcusable than in giving way to\nthe dangerous temerity of Ratchcali, which he had been always at pains\nto restrain, and permitting him to practise the same fraud upon an\nEnglish nobleman, which had been executed upon himself at Frankfort. In\nother words, the Tyrolese, by the canal of Ferdinand’s finger and\nrecommendation, sold a pebble for a real brilliant, and in a few days\nthe cheat was discovered, to the infinite confusion of our adventurer,\nwho nevertheless assumed the guise of innocence with so much art, and\nexpressed such indignation against the villain who had imposed upon his\njudgment and unsuspecting generosity, that his lordship acquitted him\nof any share in the deceit, and contented himself with the restitution,\nwhich he insisted upon making out of his own pocket, until he should be\nable to apprehend the rogue, who had thought proper to abscond for his\nown safety. In spite of all this exculpation, his character did not\nfail to retain a sort of stigma, which indeed the plainest proofs of\ninnocence are hardly able to efface; and his connexion with such a\npalpable knave as the Tyrolese appeared to be, had an effect to his\nprejudice in the minds of all those who were privy to the occurrence."

  "content": "When a man’s reputation is once brought in question, every trifle is,\nby the malevolence of mankind, magnified into a strong presumption\nagainst the culprit. A few whispers communicated by the envious mouth\nof slander, which he can have no opportunity to answer and refute,\nshall, in the opinion of the world, convict him of the most horrid\ncrimes; and for one hypocrite who is decked with the honours of virtue,\nthere are twenty good men who suffer the ignominy of vice; so well\ndisposed are individuals to trample upon the fame of their\nfellow-creatures. If the most unblemished merit is not protected from\nthis injustice, it will not be wondered at that no quarter was given to\nthe character of an adventurer like Fathom, who, among other unlucky\noccurrences, had the misfortune to be recognised about this time by his\ntwo Parisian friends, Sir Stentor Stile and Sir Giles Squirrel.These worthy knights-errant had returned to their own country, after\nhaving made a very prosperous campaign in France, at the end of which,\nhowever, they very narrowly escaped the galleys; and seeing the Polish\nCount seated at the head of taste and politeness, they immediately\ncirculated the story of his defeat at Paris, with many ludicrous\ncircumstances of their own invention, and did not scruple to affirm\nthat he was a rank impostor. When the laugh is raised upon a great man,\nhe never fails to dwindle into contempt. Ferdinand began to perceive a\nchange in the countenance of his friends. His company was no longer\nsolicited with that eagerness which they had formerly expressed in his\nbehalf. Even his entertainments were neglected; when he appeared at any\nprivate or public assembly, the ladies, instead of glowing with\npleasure, as formerly, now tittered or regarded him with looks of\ndisdain; and a certain pert, little, forward coquette, with a view to\nput him out of countenance, by raising the laugh at his expense, asked\nhim one night, at a drum, when he had heard from his relations in\nPoland? She succeeded in her design upon the mirth of the audience, but\nwas disappointed in the other part of her aim; for our hero replied,\nwithout the least mark of discomposure, “They are all in good health at\nyour service, madam; I wish I knew in what part of the world your\nrelations reside, that I might return the compliment.” By this answer,\nwhich was the more severe, as the young lady was of very doubtful\nextraction, he retorted the laugh upon the aggressor, though he\nlikewise failed in his attempt upon her temper; for she was perhaps the\nonly person present who equalled himself in stability of countenance."

  "content": "Notwithstanding this appearance of unconcern, he was deeply touched\nwith these marks of alienation in the behaviour of his friends, and,\nforeseeing in his own disgrace the total shipwreck of his fortune, he\nentered into a melancholy deliberation with himself about the means of\nretrieving his importance in the beau monde, or of turning his address\ninto some other channel, where he could stand upon a less slippery\nfoundation. In this exercise of his thoughts, no scheme occurred more\nfeasible than that of securing the booty he had made, and retiring with\nhis associate, who was also blown, into some other country, where their\nnames and characters being unknown, they might pursue their old plan of\ncommerce without molestation. He imparted this suggestion to the\nTyrolese, who approved the proposal of decamping, though he combated\nwith all his might our hero’s inclination to withdraw himself before\nthe trial, by repeating the assurances of the solicitor, who told him\nhe might depend upon being reimbursed by the sentence of the court for\ngreat part of the sums he had expended in the course of the\nprosecution.Fathom suffered himself to be persuaded by these arguments, supported\nwith the desire of making an honourable retreat, and, waiting patiently\nfor the day of trouble, discharged his sureties, by a personal\nappearance in court. Yet this was not the only score he discharged that\nmorning; the solicitor presented his own bill before they set out for\nWestminster Hall, and gave the Count to understand that it was the\ncustom, from time immemorial, for the client to clear with his attorney\nbefore trial. Ferdinand had nothing to object against this established\nrule, though he looked upon it as a bad omen, in spite of all the\nsolicitor’s confidence and protestations; and he was not a little\nconfounded, when, looking into the contents, he found himself charged\nwith 350 attendances. He knew it was not his interest to disoblige his\nlawyer at such a juncture; nevertheless, he could not help\nexpostulating with him on this article, which seemed to be so falsely\nstated with regard to the number; when his questions drew on an\nexplanation, by which he found he had incurred the penalty of three\nshillings and fourpence for every time he chanced to meet the\nconscientious attorney, either in the park, the coffee-house, or the\nstreet, provided they had exchanged the common salutation; and he had\ngood reason to believe the solicitor had often thrown himself in his\nway, with a view to swell this item of his account."

His counsel behaved like men of\nconsummate abilities in their profession; they exerted themselves with\nequal industry, eloquence, and erudition, in their endeavours to\nperplex the truth, browbeat the evidence, puzzle the judge, and mislead\nthe jury; but the defendant found himself wofully disappointed in the\ndeposition of Trapwell’s journeyman, whom the solicitor pretended to\nhave converted to his interest. This witness, as the attorney\nafterwards declared, played booty, and the facts came out so clear,\nthat Ferdinand Count Fathom was convicted of criminal conversation with\nthe plaintiff’s wife, and cast in fifteen hundred pounds, under the\ndenomination of damages.He was not so much surprised as afflicted at this decision, because he\nsaw it gradually approaching from the examination of the first\nevidence. His thoughts were now employed in casting about for some\nmethod of deliverance from the snare in which he found himself\nentangled. To escape, he foresaw it would be impracticable, as Trapwell\nwould undoubtedly be prepared for arresting him before he could quit\nWestminster Hall; he was too well acquainted with Ratchcali’s\nprinciples, to expect any assistance from that quarter in money\nmatters; and he was utterly averse to the payment of the sum awarded\nagainst him, which would have exhausted his whole fortune. He therefore\nresolved to try the friendship of some persons of fashion, with whom he\nhad maintained an intimacy of correspondence. Should they fail him in\nthe day of his necessity, he proposed to have recourse to his former\nsureties, one of whom he meant to bilk, while the other might accompany\nhim in his retreat; or, should both these expedients miscarry, he\ndetermined, rather than part with his effects, to undergo the most\ndisagreeable confinement, in hope of obtaining the jailor’s connivance\nat his escape."

To this place he was\nfollowed by his solicitor, who was allured by the prospect of another\njob, and who, with great demonstrations of satisfaction, congratulated\nhim upon the happy issue of the trial; arrogating to himself the merit\nof having saved him eight thousand pounds in the article of damages, by\nthe previous steps he had taken, and the noble defence that he and his\nfriends the counsel had made for their client; he even hinted an\nexpectation of receiving a gratuity for his extraordinary care and\ndiscretion.Fathom, galled as he was with his misfortune, and enraged at the\neffrontery of this pettifogger, maintained a serenity of countenance,\nand sent the attorney with a message to the plaintiff, importing, that,\nas he was a foreigner, and could not be supposed to have so much cash\nabout him, as to spare fifteen hundred pounds from the funds of his\nordinary expense, he would grant him a bond payable in two months,\nduring which period he should be able to procure a proper remittance\nfrom his own estate.

By the lard! the judge must have been in the terrors\nof cuckoldom, to influence the decision; and the jury a mere herd of\nhorned beasts, to bring in such a barbarous verdict. Egad! at this\nrate, no gentleman will be able to lie with another man’s wife, but at\nthe risk of a cursed prosecution. But to waive this disagreeable\ncircumstance, which you must strive to forget; I declare my\nmortification is still the greater, because I cannot at present supply\nyou with the trifle your present exigency requires; for, to tell you a\nsecret, my own finances are in damnable confusion. But a man of Count\nFathom’s figure and address can never be puzzled for the want of such a\npaltry sum. Adieu, my dear Count! we shall, I suppose, have the\npleasure of seeing you to-morrow at White’s: meanwhile, I have the\nhonour to be, with the most perfect attachment,yours, GRIZZLEGRIN.”The other noble peer, to whom he addressed himself on this occasion,\ncherished the same sentiments of virtue, friendship, and generosity;\nbut his expression was so different, that we shall, for the edification\nof the reader, transcribe his letter in his own words:—“SIR,\nI was never more astonished than at the receipt of your very\nextraordinary billet, wherein you solicit the loan of a thousand\npounds, which you desire may be sent with the bearer on the faith of\nyour parole. Sir, I have no money to send you or lend you; and cannot\nhelp repeating my expressions of surprise at your confidence in making\nsuch a strange and unwarranted demand. ’Tis true, I may have made\nprofessions of friendship, while I looked upon you as a person of\nhonour and good morals; but now that you are convicted of such a\nflagrant violation of the laws of that kingdom where you have been\ntreated with such hospitality and respect, I think myself fully\nabsolved from any such conditional promise, which indeed is never\ninterpreted into any other than a bare compliment. I am sorry you have\ninvolved your character and fortune in such a disagreeable affair, and\nam,Sir, yours, etc.\nTROMPINGTON.”Ferdinand was not such a novice in the world as to be disappointed at\nthese repulses; especially as he had laid very little stress upon the\napplication, which was made by way of an experiment upon the gratitude\nor caprice of those two noblemen, whom he had actually more than once\nobliged with the same sort of assistance which he now solicited, though\nnot to such a considerable amount."

He therefore lent a\ndeaf ear to the most pressing remonstrances of the ambassador, who had\nrecourse to several other merchants, with the same bad success; so that\nthe prisoner, despairing of bail, endeavoured to persuade Ratchcali,\nthat it would be his interest to contribute a thousand pounds towards\nhis discharge, that he might be enabled to quit England with a good\ngrace, and execute his part of the plan they had projected.So powerful was his eloquence on the occasion, and such strength of\nargument did he use, that even the Tyrolese seemed convinced, though\nreluctantly, and agreed to advance the necessary sum upon the bond and\njudgment of our adventurer, who, being disabled from transacting his\nown affairs in person, was obliged to intrust Ratchcali with his keys,\npapers, and power of attorney, under the check and inspection of his\nfaithful Maurice and the solicitor, whose fidelity he bespoke with the\npromise of an ample recompense.CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTTHE BITER IS BIT.Yet, he had no sooner committed his effects to the care of this\ntriumvirate, than his fancy was visited with direful warnings, which\nproduced cold sweats and palpitations, and threw him into such agonies\nof apprehension as he had never known before. He remembered the former\ndesertion of the Tyrolese, the recent villany of the solicitor, and\nrecollected the remarks he had made upon the disposition and character\nof his valet, which evinced him a fit companion for the other two.Alarmed at these reflections, he entreated the bailiff to indulge him\nwith a visit to his own lodgings, and even offered one hundred guineas\nas a gratification for his compliance. But the officer, who had\nformerly lost a considerable sum by the escape of a prisoner, would not\nrun any risk in an affair of such consequence, and our hero was obliged\nto submit to the tortures of his own presaging fears. After he had\nwaited five hours in the most racking impatience, he saw the attorney\nenter with all the marks of hurry, fatigue, and consternation, and\nheard him exclaim, “Good God, have you seen the gentleman?”"

Speak, and keep me no longer in suspense.” “Robbed!” cried\nthe attorney, “the Lord forbid! I hope you can depend upon the person\nyou empowered to receive your jewels and cash? I must own his\nproceedings are a little extraordinary; for after he had rummaged your\nscrutoire, from which, in presence of me and your servant, he took one\nhundred and fifty guineas, a parcel of diamond rings and buckles,\naccording to this here inventory, which I wrote with my own hand, and\nEast India bonds to the tune of five hundred more, we adjourned to\nGarraway’s, where he left me alone, under pretence of going to a broker\nof his acquaintance who lived in the neighbourhood, while the valet, as\nI imagined, waited for us in the alley. Well, sir, he stayed so long,\nthat I began to be uneasy, and at length resolved to send the servant\nin quest of him, but when I went out for that purpose, deuce a servant\nwas to be found; though I in person inquired for him at every alehouse\nwithin half a mile of the place. I then despatched no less than five\nticket porters upon the scent after them, and I myself, by a direction\nfrom the bar-keeper, went to Signior Ratchcali’s lodgings, where, as\nthey told me, he had not been seen since nine o’clock in the morning.\nUpon this intimation, I came directly hither, to give you timely\nnotice, that you may without delay take measures for your own security.\nThe best thing you can do, is to take out writs for apprehending him,\nin the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, and Essex, and I shall put\nthem in the hands of trusty and diligent officers, who will soon ferret\nhim out of his lurking-place, provided he skulks within ten miles of\nthe bills of mortality. To be sure, the job will be expensive; and all\nthese runners must be paid beforehand. But what then? the defendant is\nworth powder, and if we can once secure him, I’ll warrant the\nprosecution will quit cost.”"

Nor was his suspicion confined to the Tyrolese\nand his own lacquey; he considered the solicitor as their accomplice\nand director, and was so much provoked at the latter part of his\nharangue, that his discretion seemed to vanish, and, collaring the\nattorney, “Villain!” said he, “you yourself have been a principal actor\nin this robbery.” Then turning to the bystanders, “and I desire in the\nKing’s name that he may be secured, until I can make oath before a\nmagistrate in support of the charge. If you refuse your assistance in\ndetaining him, I will make immediate application to one of the\nsecretaries of state, who is my particular friend, and he will see\njustice done to all parties.”"

But, soon as he\nfound himself delivered from this embrace, by the interposition of the\nspectators, and collected his spirits, which had been suddenly\ndissipated by Fathom’s unexpected assault, he began to display one art\nof his occupation, which he always reserved for extraordinary\noccasions. This was the talent of abuse, which he poured forth with\nsuch fluency of opprobrious language, that our hero, smarting as he\nwas, and almost desperate with his loss, deviated from that temperance\nof behaviour which he had hitherto preserved, and snatching up the\npoker, with one stroke opened a deep trench upon the attorney’s skull,\nthat extended from the hind head almost to the upper part of the nose,\nupon each side of which it discharged a sanguine stream.\nNotwithstanding the pain of this application, the solicitor was\ntransported with joy at the sense of the smart, and inwardly\ncongratulated himself upon the appearance of his own blood, which he no\nsooner perceived, than he exclaimed, “I’m a dead man,” and fell upon\nthe floor at full length.Immediate recourse was had to a surgeon in the neighbourhood, who,\nhaving examined the wound, declared there was a dangerous depression of\nthe first table of the skull, and that, if he could save the patient’s\nlife without the application of the trepan, it would be one of the\ngreatest cures that ever were performed. By this time, Fathom’s first\ntransport being overblown, he summoned up his whole resolution, and\nreflected upon his own ruin with that fortitude which had never failed\nhim in the emergencies of his fate. Little disturbed at the prognostic\nof the surgeon, which he considered in the right point of view; “Sir,”\nsaid he, “I am not so unacquainted with the resistance of an attorney’s\nskull, as to believe the chastisement I have bestowed on him will at\nall endanger his life, which is in much greater jeopardy from the hands\nof the common executioner. For, notwithstanding this accident, I am\ndetermined to prosecute the rascal for robbery with the utmost severity\nof the law; and, that I may have a sufficient fund left for that\nprosecution, I shall not at present throw away one farthing in\nunnecessary expense, but insist upon being conveyed to prison without\nfarther delay.”"

  "content": "This declaration was equally unwelcome to the bailiff, surgeon, and\nsolicitor, who, upon the supposition that the Count was a person of\nfortune, and would rather part with an immense sum than incur the\nignominy of a jail, or involve himself in another disgraceful lawsuit,\nhad resolved to fleece him to the utmost of their power. But, now the\nattorney finding him determined to set his fate at defiance, and to\nretort upon him a prosecution, which he had no design to undergo, began\nto repent heartily of the provocation he had given, and to think\nseriously on some method to overcome the obstinacy of the incensed\nforeigner. With this view, while the bailiff conducted him to bed in\nanother apartment, he desired the catchpole to act the part of mediator\nbetween him and the Count, and furnished him with proper instructions\nfor that purpose. Accordingly the landlord, on his return, told Fathom\nthat he was sure the solicitor was not a man for this world; for that\nhe had left him deprived of his senses, and praying to God with great\ndevotion for mercy to his murderer. He then exhorted him, with many\nprotestations of friendship, to compromise the unhappy affair by\nexchanging releases with the attorney before his delirium should be\nknown, otherwise he would bring himself into a most dangerous\npremunire, whether the plaintiff should die of his wound, or live to\nprosecute him for assault. “And with regard to your charge of robbery\nagainst him,” said he, “as it is no more than a base suspicion,\nunsupported by the least shadow of evidence, the bill would be thrown\nout, and then he might sue you for damages. I therefore, out of pure\nfriendship and good-nature, advise you to compromise the affair, and,\nif you think proper, will endeavour to bring about a mutual release.”Our hero, whose passion was by this time pretty well cooled, saw reason\nfor assenting to the proposal; upon which the deed was immediately\nexecuted, the mediator’s bill was discharged, and Ferdinand conveyed in\nan hackney-coach to prison, after he had empowered his own landlord to\ndischarge his servants, and convert his effects into ready money. Thus,\nhe saw himself, in the course of a few hours, deprived of his\nreputation, rank, liberty, and friends; and his fortune reduced from\ntwo thousand pounds to something less than two hundred, fifty of which\nhe had carried to jail in his pocket.END OF VOL.

And, d’ye\nhear, send Ragged-head with five pounds of potatoes for Major\nMacleaver’s supper, and let him have what drink he wants; the fat widow\ngentlewoman from Pimlico has promised to quit his score. Sir Mungo\nBarebones may have some hasty pudding and small beer, though I don’t\nexpect to see his coin, no more than to receive the eighteen pence I\nlaid out for a pair of breeches to his backside—what then? he’s a quiet\nsort of a body, and a great scholar, and it was a scandal to the place\nto see him going about in that naked condition. As for the mad\nFrenchman with the beard, if you give him so much as a cheese-paring,\nyou b—ch, I’ll send you back to the hole, among your old companions; an\nimpudent dog! I’ll teach him to draw his sword upon the governor of an\nEnglish county jail. What! I suppose he thought he had to do with a\nFrench hang-tang-dang, rabbit him! he shall eat his white feather,\nbefore I give him credit for a morsel of bread.”Although our adventurer was very little disposed, at this juncture, to\nmake observations foreign to his own affairs, he could not help taking\nnotice of these extraordinary injunctions; especially those concerning\nthe person who was entitled king, whom, however, he supposed to be some\nprisoner elected as the magistrate by the joint suffrage of his\nfellows. Having taken possession of his chamber, which he rented at\nfive shillings a week, and being ill at ease in his own thoughts, he\nforthwith secured his door, undressed, and went to bed, in which,\nthough it was none of the most elegant or inviting couches, he enjoyed\nprofound repose after the accumulated fatigues and mortifications of\nthe day. Next morning, after breakfast, the keeper entered his\napartment, and gave him to understand, that the gentlemen under his\ncare, having heard of the Count’s arrival, had deputed one of their\nnumber to wait upon him with the compliments of condolence suitable to\nthe occasion, and invite him to become a member of their society. Our\nhero could not politely dispense with this instance of civility, and\ntheir ambassador being instantly introduced by the name of Captain\nMinikin, saluted him with great solemnity."

  "content": "This was a person equally remarkable for his extraordinary figure and\naddress; his age seemed to border upon forty, his stature amounted to\nfive feet, his visage was long, meagre, and weather-beaten, and his\naspect, though not quite rueful, exhibited a certain formality, which\nwas the result of care and conscious importance. He was very little\nencumbered with flesh and blood; yet what body he had was well\nproportioned, his limbs were elegantly turned, and by his carriage he\nwas well entitled to that compliment which we pay to any person when we\nsay he has very much the air of a gentleman. There was also an evident\nsingularity in his dress, which, though intended as an improvement,\nappeared to be an extravagant exaggeration of the mode, and at once\nevinced him an original to the discerning eyes of our adventurer, who\nreceived him with his usual complaisance, and made a very eloquent\nacknowledgment of the honour and satisfaction he received from the\nvisit of the representative, and the hospitality of his constituents.\nThe captain’s peculiarities were not confined to his external\nappearance; for his voice resembled the sound of a bassoon, or the\naggregate hum of a whole bee-hive, and his discourse was almost nothing\nelse than a series of quotations from the English poets, interlarded\nwith French phrases, which he retained for their significance, on the\nrecommendation of his friends, being himself unacquainted with that or\nany other outlandish tongue.Fathom, finding this gentleman of a very communicative disposition,\nthought he could not have a fairer opportunity of learning the history\nof his fellow-prisoners; and, turning the conversation on that subject,\nwas not disappointed in his expectation. “I don’t doubt, sir,” said he,\nwith the utmost solemnity of declamation, “but you look with horror\nupon every object that surrounds you in this uncomfortable place; but,\nnevertheless, here are some, who, as my friend Shakespeare has it, have\nseen better days, and have with holy bell been knolled to church; and\nsat at good men’s feasts, and wiped their eyes of drops that sacred\npity hath engendered. You must know, sir, that, exclusive of the\ncanaille, or the profanum vulgus, as they are styled by Horace, there\nare several small communities in the jail, consisting of people who are\nattracted by the manners and dispositions of each other; for this\nplace, sir, is quite a microcosm, and as the great world, so is this, a\nstage, and all the men and women merely players. For my own part, sir,\nI have always made it a maxim to associate with the best of company I\ncan find. Not that I pretend to boast of my family or extraction;\nbecause, you know, as the poet says, Vix ea nostra voco. My father,\n’tis true, was a man that piqued himself upon his pedigree, as well as\nupon his politesse and personal merit; for he had been a very old\nofficer in the army, and I myself may say I was born with a spontoon in\nmy hand. Sir, I have had the honour to serve his Majesty these twenty\nyears, and have been bandied about in the course of duty through all\nthe British plantations, and you see the recompense of all my service.\nBut this is a disagreeable subject, and therefore I shall waive it;\nhowever, as Butler observes:My only comfort is, that now\nMy dubbolt fortune is so low,\nThat either it must quickly end,\nOr turn about again and mend."

Heu!\nquantum mutatus ab illo. It is not my business to censure the conduct\nof my superiors; but I always speak my mind in a cavalier manner, and\nas, according to the Spectator, talking to a friend is no more than\nthinking aloud, entre nous, his Corsican majesty has been scurvily\ntreated by a certain administration. Be that as it will, he is a\npersonage of a very portly appearance, and is quite master of the\nbienseance. Besides, they will find it their interest to have recourse\nagain to his alliance; and in that case some of us may expect to profit\nby his restoration. But few words are best.“He that maintains the second rank in our assembly is one Major\nMacleaver, an Irish gentleman, who has served abroad; a soldier of\nfortune, sir, a man of unquestionable honour and courage, but a little\noverbearing, in consequence of his knowledge and experience. He is a\nperson of good address,—to be sure, and quite free of the mauvaise\nhonte, and he may have seen a good deal of service. But what then?\nother people may be as good as he, though they have not had such\nopportunities; if he speaks five or six languages, he does not pretend\nto any taste in the liberal arts, which are the criterion of an\naccomplished gentleman.“The next is Sir Mungo Barebones, the representative of a very ancient\nfamily in the north; his affairs are very much deranged, but he is a\ngentleman of great probity and learning, and at present engaged in a\nvery grand scheme, which, if he can bring it to bear, will render him\nfamous to all posterity; no less than the conversion of the Jews and\nthe Gentiles. The project, I own, looks chimerical to one who has not\nconversed with the author; but, in my opinion, he has clearly\ndemonstrated, from an anagrammatical analysis of a certain Hebrew word,\nthat his present Majesty, whom God preserve, is the person pointed at\nin Scripture as the temporal Messiah of the Jews; and, if he could once\nraise by subscription such a trifling sum as twelve hundred thousand\npounds, I make no doubt but he would accomplish his aim, vast and\nromantic as it seems to be."
