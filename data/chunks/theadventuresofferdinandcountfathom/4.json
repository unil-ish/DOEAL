  "content": "It was well for our adventurer that his good fortune so seasonably\ninterposed; for that same day, in the afternoon, he was favoured with a\nbillet from the jeweller’s wife, couched in the same tender style she\nhad formerly used, and importing an earnest desire of seeing him next\nday at the wonted rendezvous. Although his penetration was sufficient\nto perceive the drift of this message, or at least to discern the risk\nhe should run in complying with her request, yet he was willing to be\nmore fully certified of the truth of his suspicion, and wrote an answer\nto the billet, in which he assured her, that he would repair to the\nplace of appointment with all the punctuality of an impatient lover.\nNevertheless, instead of performing this promise, he, in the morning,\ntook post in a public-house opposite to the place of assignation, in\norder to reconnoitre the ground, and about noon had the pleasure of\nseeing the German, wrapped in a cloak, enter the door of his wife’s\nshe-friend, though the appointment was fixed at five in the evening.\nFathom blessed his good angel for having conducted him clear of this\nconspiracy, and kept his station with great tranquillity till the hour\nof meeting, when he beheld his enraged Thalestris take the same route,\nand enjoyed her disappointment with ineffable satisfaction.Thus favoured with a pretext, he took his leave of her, in a letter,\ngiving her to understand, that he was no stranger to the barbarous\nsnare she had laid for him; and upbraiding her with having made such an\nungrateful return for all his tenderness and attachment. She was not\nbackward in conveying a reply to this expostulation, which seemed to\nhave been dictated in all the distraction of a proud woman who sees her\nvengeance baffled, as well as her love disdained. Her letter was\nnothing but a succession of reproaches, menaces, and incoherent\nexecrations. She taxed him with knavery, insensibility, and\ndissimulation; imprecated a thousand curses upon his head, and\nthreatened not only to persecute his life with all the arts that hell\nand malice could inspire, but also to wound him in the person of her\ndaughter-in-law, who should be enclosed for life in a convent, where\nshe should have leisure to repent of those loose and disorderly\npractices which he had taught her to commit, and of which she could not\npretend innocence, as they had it in their power to confront her with\nthe evidence of her lover’s own confession. Yet all this denunciation\nwas qualified with an alternative, by which he was given to understand,\nthat the gates of mercy were still open, and that penitence was capable\nof washing out the deepest stain of guilt."

  "content": "Ferdinand read the whole remonstrance with great composure and\nmoderation, and was content to incur the hazard of her hate, rather\nthan put her to the trouble of making such an effort of generosity, as\nwould induce her to forgive the heinous offence he had committed; nor\ndid his apprehension for Wilhelmina in the least influence his\nbehaviour on this occasion. So zealous was he for her spiritual\nconcerns, that he would have been glad to hear she had actually taken\nthe veil; but he knew such a step was not at all agreeable to her\ndisposition, and that no violence would be offered to her inclinations\non that score, unless her stepmother should communicate to the father\nthat letter of Fathom’s which she had intercepted, and by which the\nGerman would be convinced of his daughter’s backsliding; but this\nmeasure, he rightly supposed, the wife would not venture to take, lest\nthe husband, instead of taking her advice touching the young lady,\nshould seek to compromise the affair, by offering her in marriage to\nher debaucher, a proffer which, if accepted, would overwhelm the mother\nwith vexation and despair. He therefore chose to trust to the effects\nof lenient time, which he hoped would gradually weaken the resentment\nof this Penthesilea, and dissolve his connexion with the other parts of\nthe family, from which he longed to be totally detached.How well soever he might have succeeded in his attempts to shake off\nthe yoke of the mother, who by her situation in life was restrained\nfrom prosecuting those measures her resentment had planned against his\nfortitude and indifference, he would have found greater difficulty than\nhe had foreseen, in disengaging himself from the daughter, whose\naffections he had won under the most solemn professions of honour and\nfidelity, and who, now she was debarred of his company and\nconversation, and in danger of losing him for ever, had actually taken\nthe resolution of disclosing the amour to her father, that he might\ninterpose in behalf of her peace and reputation, and secure her\nhappiness by the sanction of the church.CHAPTER EIGHTEENOUR HERO DEPARTS FROM VIENNA, AND QUITS THE DOMAIN OF VENUS FOR THE\nROUGH FIELD OF MARS.Luckily for our adventurer, before she adhered to this determination,\nthe young Count de Melvil was summoned to Presburg by his father, who\ndesired to see him, before he should take the field, in consequence of\na rupture between the Emperor and the French King; and Fathom of course\nquitted Vienna, in order to attend his patron, after he and Renaldo had\nresided two whole years in that capital, where the former had made\nhimself perfect in all the polite exercises, become master of the\nFrench tongue, and learned to speak the Italian with great facility;\nover and above those other accomplishments in which we have represented\nhim as an inimitable original."

  "content": "As for the young Count, his exteriors were so much improved by the\ncompany to which he had access, since his departure from his father’s\nhouse, that his parents were equally surprised and overjoyed at the\nalteration. All that awkwardness and rusticity, which hung upon his\ndeportment, was, like the rough coat of a diamond, polished away; the\nconnexion and disposition of his limbs seemed to have been adjusted\nanew; his carriage was become easy, his air perfectly genteel, and his\nconversation gay and unrestrained. The merit of this reformation was in\na great measure ascribed to the care and example of Mr. Fathom, who was\nreceived by the old Count and his lady with marks of singular\nfriendship and esteem; nor was he overlooked by Mademoiselle, who still\nremained in a state of celibacy, and seemed to have resigned all hope\nof altering her condition; she expressed uncommon satisfaction at the\nreturn of her old favourite, and readmitted him into the same degree of\nfamiliarity with which he had been honoured before his departure.The joy of Teresa was so excessive at his arrival, that she could\nscarce suppress her raptures, so as to conceal them from the notice of\nthe family; and our hero, upon this occasion, performed the part of an\nexquisite actor, in dissembling those transports which his bosom never\nknew. So well had this pupil retained the lessons of her instructor,\nthat, in the midst of those fraudulent appropriations, which she still\ncontinued to make, she had found means to support her interest and\ncharacter with Mademoiselle, and even to acquire such influence in the\nfamily, that no other servant, male or female, could pretend to live\nunder the same roof, without paying incessant homage to this artful\nwaiting-woman, and yielding the most abject submission to her will.The young gentlemen having tarried at Presburg about six weeks, during\nwhich a small field equipage was prepared for Renaldo, they repaired to\nthe camp at Heilbron, under the auspices of Count Melvil, in whose\nregiment they carried arms as volunteers, with a view to merit\npromotion in the service by their own personal behaviour. Our\nadventurer would have willingly dispensed with this occasion of\nsignalising himself, his talents being much better adapted to another\nsphere of life; nevertheless, he affected uncommon alacrity at the\nprospect of gathering laurels in the field, and subscribed to his\nfortune with a good grace; foreseeing, that even in a campaign, a man\nof his art and ingenuity might find means to consult his corporal\nsafety, without any danger to his reputation. Accordingly, before he\nhad lived full three weeks in camp, the damp situation, and sudden\nchange in his way of life, had such a violent effect upon his\nconstitution, that he was deprived of the use of all his limbs, and\nmourned, without ceasing, his hard fate, by which he found himself\nprecluded from all opportunity of exerting his diligence, courage, and\nactivity, in the character of a soldier, to which he now aspired."

  "content": "Renaldo, who was actually enamoured of a martial life, and missed no\noccasion of distinguishing himself, consoled his companion with great\ncordiality, encouraged him with the hope of seeing his constitution\nfamiliarised to the inconveniences of a camp, and accommodated him with\neverything which he thought would alleviate the pain of his body, as\nwell as the anxiety of his mind. The old Count, who sincerely\nsympathised with his affliction, would have persuaded him to retire\ninto quarters, where he could be carefully nursed, and provided with\neverything necessary to a person in his condition; but such was his\ndesire of glory, that he resisted his patron’s importunities with great\nconstancy, till at length, seeing the old gentleman obstinately\ndetermined to consult his health by removing him from the field, he\ngradually suffered himself to recover the use of his hands, made shift\nto sit up in his bed, and amuse himself with cards or backgammon, and,\nnotwithstanding the feeble condition of his legs, ventured to ride out\non horseback to visit the lines, though the Count and his son would\nnever yield to his solicitations so far, as to let him accompany\nRenaldo in those excursions and reconnoitring parties, by which a\nvolunteer inures himself to toil and peril, and acquires that knowledge\nin the operations of war, which qualifies him for a command in the\nservice.Notwithstanding this exemption from all duty, our adventurer managed\nmatters so as to pass for a youth of infinite mettle, and even rendered\nhis backwardness and timidity subservient to the support of that\ncharacter, by expressing an impatience of lying inactive, and a desire\nof signalising his prowess, which even the disabled condition of his\nbody could scarce restrain. He must be a man of very weak nerves and\nexcessive irresolution, who can live in the midst of actual service,\nwithout imbibing some portion of military fortitude: danger becomes\nhabitual, and loses a great part of its terror; and as fear is often\ncaught by contagion, so is courage communicated among the individuals\nof an army. The hope of fame, desire of honours and preferment, envy,\nemulation, and the dread of disgrace, are motives which co-operate in\nsuppressing that aversion to death or mutilation, which nature hath\nimplanted in the human mind; and therefore it is not to be wondered at,\nif Fathom, who was naturally chicken-hearted, gained some advantages\nover his disposition before the end of the campaign, which happened to\nbe neither perilous nor severe."

  "content": "During the winter, while both armies remained in quarters, our\nadventurer attended his patron to Presburg, and, before the troops were\nin motion, Renaldo obtained a commission, in consequence of which he\nwent into garrison at Philipsburg, whither he was followed by our hero,\nwhile the old Count’s duty called him to the field in a different\nplace. Ferdinand for some time had no reason to be dissatisfied with\nthis disposition, by which he was at once delivered from the fatigues\nof a campaign, and the inspection of a severe censor, in the person of\nCount Melvil; and his satisfaction was still increased by an accidental\nmeeting with the Tyrolese who had been his confederate at Vienna, and\nnow chanced to serve in garrison on the same footing with himself.\nThese two knights-errant renewed their former correspondence, and, as\nall soldiers are addicted to gaming, levied contributions upon all\nthose officers who had money to lose, and temerity to play.However, they had not long pursued this branch of traffic, when their\nsuccess was interrupted by a very serious occurrence, that for the\npresent entirely detached the gentlemen in the garrison from such\namusements. The French troops invested Fort Kehl, situated on the\nRhine, opposite to Strasburg; and the Imperialists, dreading that the\nnext storm would fall upon Philipsburg, employed themselves with great\ndiligence to put that important fortress in a proper posture of\ndefence. If the suspension of play was displeasing to our hero, the\nexpectation of being besieged was by no means more agreeable. He knew\nthe excellence of the French engineers, the power of their artillery,\nand the perseverance of their general. He felt, by anticipation, the\ntoils of hard duty upon the works, the horrors of night-alarms,\ncannonading, bombardment, sallies, and mines blown up; and deliberated\nwith himself whether or not he should privately withdraw, and take\nrefuge among the besiegers; but, when he reflected that such a step,\nbesides the infamy that must attend it, would be like that of running\nupon Scylla, seeking to avoid Charybdis, as he would be exposed to more\ndanger and inconvenience in the trenches than he could possibly undergo\nin the town, and after all run the risk of being taken and treated as a\ndeserter; upon these considerations he resolved to submit himself to\nhis destiny, and endeavoured to mitigate the rigour of his fate by\nthose arts he had formerly practised with success. He accordingly found\nmeans to enjoy a very bad state of health during the whole siege, which\nlasted about six weeks after the trenches were opened; and then the\ngarrison marched out by capitulation, with all the honours of war.CHAPTER NINETEENHE PUTS HIMSELF UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF HIS ASSOCIATE, AND STUMBLES UPON\nTHE FRENCH CAMP, WHERE HE FINISHES HIS MILITARY CAREER."

  "content": "Nothing else of moment was transacted during that campaign; and in the\nwinter our adventurer, with the young Count, and his friend the\nTyrolese, were disposed in quarters of cantonment, where Ferdinand made\nhimself amends for the chagrin he had undergone, by the exercise of\nthose talents in which he excelled. Not that he was satisfied with the\nsphere of life in which he acted; though he knew himself consummate in\nthe art of play, he was not at all ambitious of a gamester’s name; nor\ndid he find himself disposed to hazard those discoveries and\nexplanations to which heroes of that class are sometimes necessarily\nexposed. His aim was to dwell among the tents of civil life,\nundisturbed by quarrels and the din of war, and render mankind\nsubservient to his interest, not by stratagems which irritate, but by\nthat suppleness of insinuation, which could not fail to soothe the\ntemper of those on whom he meant to prey.He saw that all his expectations of Count Melvil’s future favour were\nconnected with his choice of a military life; and that his promotion in\nthe service would, in a great measure, depend upon his personal\nbehaviour in such emergencies as he did not at all wish to encounter.\nOn the other hand, he confided so much in his own dexterity and\naddress, that he never doubted of being able to rear a splendid fortune\nfor himself, provided he could once obtain a fixed and firm foundation.\nHe had in fancy often enjoyed a prospect of England, not only as his\nnative country, to which, like a true citizen, he longed to be united;\nbut also as the land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, and\nabounding with subjects on which he knew his talents would be properly\nexercised.These reflections never occurred, without leaving a strong impression\nupon the mind of our adventurer, which influenced his deliberations in\nsuch a manner, as at length amounted to a perfect resolution of\nwithdrawing himself privately from a service that teemed with\ndisagreeable events, and of transporting himself into the country of\nhis ancestors, which he considered as the Canaan of all able\nadventurers. But, previous to his appearance on that stage, he was\ndesirous of visiting the metropolis of France, in which he hoped to\nimprove himself in the knowledge of men and things, and acquire such\nintelligence as would qualify him to act a more important part upon the\nBritish scene. After having for some time indulged these prospects in\nsecret, he determined to accommodate himself with the company and\nexperience of the Tyrolese, whom, under the specious title of an\nassociate, he knew he could convert into a very serviceable tool, in\nforwarding the execution of his own projects."

  "content": "Accordingly, the inclination of this confederate was sounded by distant\nhints, and being found apt, our hero made him privy to his design of\ndecamping without beat of drum; though, at the same time, he begged his\nadvice touching the method of their departure, that he might retire\nwith as much delicacy as the nature of such a step would permit. Divers\nconsultations were held upon this subject, before they adhered to the\nresolution of making their escape from the army, after it should have\ntaken the field in the spring; because, in that case, they would have\nfrequent opportunities of going abroad on foraging parties, and, during\none of these excursions, might retire in such a manner as to persuade\ntheir companions that they had fallen into the enemy’s hands.Agreeable to this determination, the camp was no sooner formed in\nAlsace than our associates began to make preparations for their march,\nand had already taken all the previous measures for their departure,\nwhen an accident happened, which our hero did not fail to convert to\nhis own advantage. This was no other than the desertion of Renaldo’s\nvalet, who, in consequence of a gentle chastisement, which he had\nrichly merited, thought proper to disappear, after having plundered his\nmaster’s portmanteau, which he had forced open for the purpose.\nFerdinand, who was the first person that discovered the theft,\nimmediately comprehended the whole adventure, and, taking it for\ngranted that the delinquent would never return, resolved to finish what\nthe fugitive had imperfectly performed.Being favoured with the unreserved confidence of the young Count, he\ninstantly had recourse to his bureau, the locks of which he found means\nto burst open, and, examining a private drawer, contrived with great\nart to conceal Renaldo’s jewels and cash, made himself master of the\ncontents without hesitation; then cutting open his cloak-bag, and\nstrewing the tent with his linen and clothes, began to raise his voice,\nand produce such a clamour as alarmed the whole neighbourhood, and\nbrought a great many officers into the tent."

  "content": "He on this, as on all other occasions, performed his cue to a miracle,\nexpressing confusion and concern so naturally in his gestures and\nexclamation, that no man could possibly suspect his sincerity; nay, to\nsuch a degree of finesse did his cunning amount, that when his friend\nand patron entered, in consequence of an intimation he soon received of\nhis loss, our adventurer exhibited undoubted signs of distraction and\ndelirium, and, springing upon Renaldo with all the frantic fury of a\nbedlamite, “Villain,” cried he, “restore the effects you have stole\nfrom your master, or you shall be immediately committed to the care of\nthe prevot.” However mortified M. de Melvil might be at his own\nmisfortune, the condition of his friend seemed to touch him more\nnearly; he undervalued his own loss as a trifle that could be easily\nrepaired; said everything which he thought would tend to soothe and\ncompose the agitation of Ferdinand; and finally prevailed upon him to\nretire to rest. The calamity was wholly attributed to the deserter; and\nRenaldo, far from suspecting the true author, took occasion, from his\nbehaviour on this emergency, to admire him as a mirror of integrity and\nattachment; in such an exquisite manner did he plan all his designs,\nthat almost every instance of his fraud furnished matter of triumph to\nhis reputation.Having thus profitably exercised his genius, this subtle politician\nthought it high time to relinquish his military expectations, and\nsecuring all his valuable acquisitions about his own person, rode out\nwith his understrapper, in the midst of fifty dragoons, who went in\nquest of forage. While the troopers were employed in making up their\ntrusses, the two adventurers advanced towards the skirt of a wood, on\npretence of reconnoitring, and the Tyrolese, who undertook to be our\nhero’s guide, directing him to a path which leads towards Strasburg,\nthey suddenly vanished from the eyes of their companions, who in a few\nminutes hearing the report of several pistols, which the confederates\npurposely fired, conjectured that they had fallen in with a party of\nFrench, by whom they were made prisoners of war.The Tyrolese had overrated his own knowledge when he took upon himself\nthe charge of conducting our hero; for upon their arrival at a certain\nplace, where two roads crossed each other, he chanced to follow that\nwhich not only frustrated their intention, but even led them directly\nto the French camp; so that, in the twilight, they fell in upon one of\nthe outguards before they were aware of their mistake.Whatever confusion and perplexity they might undergo, when they heard\nthemselves questioned by the sentinel on the advanced post, certain it\nis, they betrayed no symptoms of fear or disorder; but while Ferdinand\nendeavoured to recollect himself, his fellow-traveller, with the\nappearance of admirable intrepidity and presence of mind, told the\nsoldier that he and his companion were two gentlemen of family, who had\nquitted the Austrian army, on account of having sustained some\nill-usage, which they had no opportunity of resenting in any other way,\nand that they were come to offer their services to the French general,\nto whose quarters they desired to be immediately conveyed."

Though this translation was not at\nall to our hero’s liking, he was forced to acquiesce in his fate, glad\nto find himself, on these terms, in possession of his effects, of which\nhe would otherwise have been infallibly rifled.This campaign, however, was the most disagreeable period of his whole\nlife; because the manner in which he had entered into the service\nsubjected him to the particular observation and notice of the French\nofficers; so that he was obliged to be very alert in his duty, and\nsummon all his fortitude to maintain the character he had assumed. What\nrendered his situation still more unpalatable, was the activity of both\narmies in the course of this season, during which, over and above\nsundry fatiguing marches and countermarches, he was personally engaged\nin the affair of Halleh, which was very obstinate; where, being in the\nskirts of the detachment, he was actually wounded in the face by the\nsword of an hussar; but this was, luckily for him, the last time he\nfound himself under the necessity of exerting his military prowess, for\na cessation of arms was proclaimed before he was cured of his wound,\nand peace concluded about the end of the campaign."

In this capacity he had managed\nhis matters to such advantage, that many French officers of rank were\nvery well disposed to contribute their interest in his behalf, had his\ninclination verged towards promotion in the army; but he thought proper\nto conceal his real design, under the specious pretext of longing to\nsee the metropolis of France, that centre of pleasure and politeness,\nin which he proposed to spend some time for the improvement of his\naddress and understanding. These were motives too laudable to be\nopposed by his new patrons, some of whom furnished him with letters of\nrecommendation to certain noblemen of the first rank at the court of\nVersailles, for which place he and his companion set out from the banks\nof the Rhine, very well satisfied with the honourable dismission they\nhad obtained from a life of inconvenience, danger, and alarm.CHAPTER TWENTYHE PREPARES A STRATAGEM BUT FINDS HIMSELF COUNTERMINED—PROCEEDS ON HIS\nJOURNEY, AND IS OVERTAKEN BY A TERRIBLE TEMPEST.In the course of this journey, Ferdinand, who was never deficient in\nhis political capacity, held a secret conclave with his own thoughts,\nnot only touching the plan of his own future conduct, but also\nconcerning his associate, of whose fidelity and adherence he began to\nentertain such doubts as discouraged him from the prosecution of that\ndesign in which the Tyrolese had been at first included; for he had\nlately observed him practise the arts of his occupation among the\nFrench officers, with such rapacity and want of caution, as indicated a\ndangerous temerity of temper, as well as a furious rage of acquiring,\nwhich might be some time or other satiated upon his own friends. In\nother words, our adventurer was afraid that his accomplice would profit\nby his knowledge of the road and countries through which they\ntravelled, and, after having made free with his most valuable effects,\nin consequence of the familiarity subsisting between them, leave him\nsome morning without the ceremony of a formal adieu."

So eager was our hero to leave the Tyrolese at a\nconsiderable distance behind, that he rode all night at a round pace\nwithout halting, and next morning found himself at a village distant\nthirteen good leagues from any part of the route which he and his\ncompanion had at first resolved to pursue.Here, thinking himself safely delivered from the cause of all his\napprehension, he determined to lie incognito for a few days, so as that\nhe might run no risk of an accidental meeting upon the road with the\nperson whose company he had forsaken; and accordingly took possession\nof an apartment, in which he went to rest, desiring his guide to wake\nhim when dinner should be ready. Having enjoyed a very comfortable\nrefreshment of sleep, with his bags under his pillow, he was summoned,\naccording to his direction, and ate a very hearty meal, with great\ntranquillity and internal satisfaction. In the afternoon he amused\nhimself with happy presages and ideal prospects of his future fortune,\nand, in the midst of these imaginary banquets, was seized with an\ninclination of realising his bliss, and regaling his eyesight with the\nfruits of that success which had hitherto attended his endeavours. Thus\ninflamed, he opened the repository, and, O reader! what were his\nreflections, when, in lieu of Mademoiselle Melvil’s ear-rings and\nnecklace, the German’s golden chain, divers jewels of considerable\nvalue, the spoils of sundry dupes, and about two hundred ducats in\nready money, he found neither more nor less than a parcel of rusty\nnails, disposed in such a manner as to resemble in weight and bulk the\nmoveables he had lost."

If the eternal salvation of mankind could have been purchased\nfor the tenth part of his treasure, he would have left the whole\nspecies in a state of reprobation, rather than redeem them at that\nprice, unless he had seen in the bargain some evident advantage to his\nown concerns. One may, therefore, easily conceive with what milkiness\nof resignation he bore the loss of the whole, and saw himself reduced\nfrom such affluence to the necessity of depending upon about twenty\nducats, and some loose silver, which he carried in his pocket, for his\nexpense upon the road. However bitter this pill might be in swallowing,\nhe so far mastered his mortification, as to digest it with a good\ngrace. His own penetration at once pointed out the canal through which\nthis misfortune had flowed upon him; he forthwith placed the calamity\nto the account of the Tyrolese, and never doubting that he had retired\nwith the booty across the Rhine, into some place to which he knew\nFathom would not follow his footsteps, he formed the melancholy\nresolution of pursuing with all despatch his journey to Paris, that he\nmight, with all convenient expedition, indemnify himself for the\ndiscomfiture he had sustained.With regard to his confederate, his conjecture was perfectly right;\nthat adventurer, though infinitely inferior to our hero in point of\ngenius and invention, had manifestly the advantage of him in the\narticles of age and experience; he was no stranger to Fathom’s\nqualifications, the happy exertion of which he had often seen. He knew\nhim to be an economist of the most frugal order, consequently concluded\nhis finances were worthy of examination; and, upon the true principles\nof a sharper, eased him of the encumbrance, taking it for granted,\nthat, in so doing, he only precluded Ferdinand from the power of acting\nthe same tragedy upon him, should ever opportunity concur with his\ninclination. He had therefore concerted his measures with the dexterity\nof an experienced conveyancer, and, snatching the occasion, while our\nhero, travel-tainted, lay sunk in the arms of profound repose, he\nripped up the seams of the leather depository, withdrew the contents,\nintroduced the parcel of nails, which he had made up for the purpose,\nand then repaired the breach with great deliberation.Had Fathom’s good genius prompted him to examine his effects next\nmorning, the Tyrolese, in all probability, would have maintained his\nacquisition by force of arms; for his personal courage was rather more\ndetermined than that of our adventurer, and he was conscious of his own\nascendency in this particular; but his good fortune prevented such\nexplanation. Immediately after dinner, he availed himself of his\nknowledge, and, betaking himself to a remote part of the town, set out\nin a post-chaise for Luneville, while our hero was meditating his own\nescape."

  "content": "Fathom’s conception was sufficient to comprehend the whole of this\nadventure, as soon as his chagrin would give his sagacity fair play;\nnor would he allow his resolution to sink under the trial; on the\ncontrary, he departed from the village that same afternoon, under the\nauspices of his conductor, and found himself benighted in the midst of\na forest, far from the habitations of men. The darkness of the night,\nthe silence and solitude of the place, the indistinct images of the\ntrees that appeared on every side, “stretching their extravagant arms\nathwart the gloom,” conspired, with the dejection of spirits occasioned\nby his loss, to disturb his fancy, and raise strange phantoms in his\nimagination. Although he was not naturally superstitious, his mind\nbegan to be invaded with an awful horror, that gradually prevailed over\nall the consolations of reason and philosophy; nor was his heart free\nfrom the terrors of assassination. In order to dissipate these\ndisagreeable reveries, he had recourse to the conversation of his\nguide, by whom he was entertained with the history of divers travellers\nwho had been robbed and murdered by ruffians, whose retreat was in the\nrecesses of that very wood.In the midst of this communication, which did not at all tend to the\nelevation of our hero’s spirits, the conductor made an excuse for\ndropping behind, while our traveller jogged on in expectation of being\njoined again by him in a few minutes. He was, however, disappointed in\nthat hope; the sound of the other horse’s feet by degrees grew more and\nmore faint, and at last altogether died away. Alarmed at this\ncircumstance, Fathom halted in the middle of the road, and listened\nwith the most fearful attention; but his sense of hearing was saluted\nwith nought but the dismal sighings of the trees, that seemed to\nforetell an approaching storm. Accordingly, the heavens contracted a\nmore dreary aspect, the lightning began to gleam, and the thunder to\nroll, and the tempest, raising its voice to a tremendous roar,\ndescended in a torrent of rain.In this emergency, the fortitude of our hero was almost quite overcome.\nSo many concurring circumstances of danger and distress might have\nappalled the most undaunted breast; what impression then must they have\nmade upon the mind of Ferdinand, who was by no means a man to set fear\nat defiance! Indeed, he had well-nigh lost the use of his reflection,\nand was actually invaded to the skin, before he could recollect himself\nso far as to quit the road, and seek for shelter among the thickets\nthat surrounded him. Having rode some furlongs into the forest, he took\nhis station under a tuft of tall trees, that screened him from the\nstorm, and in that situation called a council within himself, to\ndeliberate upon his next excursion. He persuaded himself that his guide\nhad deserted him for the present, in order to give intelligence of a\ntraveller to some gang of robbers with whom he was connected; and that\nhe must of necessity fall a prey to those banditti, unless he should\nhave the good fortune to elude their search, and disentangle himself\nfrom the mazes of the wood."

For this purpose he turned his horse’s head\nin a line quite contrary to the direction of the high road which he had\nleft, on the supposition that the robbers would pursue that track in\nquest of him, and that they would never dream of his deserting the\nhighway, to traverse an unknown forest, amidst the darkness of such a\nboisterous night. After he had continued in this progress through a\nsuccession of groves, and bogs, and thorns, and brakes, by which not\nonly his clothes, but also his skin suffered in a grievous manner,\nwhile every nerve quivered with eagerness and dismay, he at length\nreached an open plain, and pursuing his course, in full hope of\narriving at some village, where his life would be safe, he descried a\nrush-light at a distance, which he looked upon as the star of his good\nfortune, and riding towards it at full speed, arrived at the door of a\nlone cottage, into which he was admitted by an old woman, who,\nunderstanding he was a bewildered traveller, received him with great\nhospitality.When he learned from his hostess, that there was not another house\nwithin three leagues; that she could accommodate him with a tolerable\nbed, and his horse with lodging and oats, he thanked Heaven for his\ngood fortune, in stumbling upon this homely habitation, and determined\nto pass the night under the protection of the old cottager, who gave\nhim to understand, that her husband, who was a faggot-maker, had gone\nto the next town to dispose of his merchandise; and that, in all\nprobability, he would not return till next morning, on account of the\ntempestuous night. Ferdinand sounded the beldame with a thousand artful\ninterrogations, and she answered with such appearance of truth and\nsimplicity, that he concluded his person was quite secure; and, after\nhaving been regaled with a dish of eggs and bacon, desired she would\nconduct him into the chamber where she proposed he should take his\nrepose. He was accordingly ushered up by a sort of ladder into an\napartment furnished with a standing-bed, and almost half filled with\ntrusses of straw. He seemed extremely well pleased with his lodging,\nwhich in reality exceeded his expectation; and his kind landlady,\ncautioning him against letting the candle approach the combustibles,\ntook her leave, and locked the door on the outside.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEHE FALLS UPON SCYLLA, SEEKING TO AVOID CHARYBDIS."

In consequence of these suggestions, he\nproposed to take an accurate survey of every object in the apartment,\nand, in the course of his inquiry, had the mortification to find the\ndead body of a man, still warm, who had been lately stabbed, and\nconcealed beneath several bundles of straw.Such a discovery could not fail to fill the breast of our hero with\nunspeakable horror; for he concluded that he himself would undergo the\nsame fate before morning, without the interposition of a miracle in his\nfavour. In the first transports of his dread, he ran to the window,\nwith a view to escape by that outlet, and found his flight effectually\nobstructed by divers strong bars of iron. Then his heart began to\npalpitate, his hair to bristle up, and his knees to totter; his\nthoughts teemed with presages of death and destruction; his conscience\nrose up in judgment against him, and he underwent a severe paroxysm of\ndismay and distraction. His spirits were agitated into a state of\nfermentation that produced a species of resolution akin to that which\nis inspired by brandy or other strong liquors, and, by an impulse that\nseemed supernatural, he was immediately hurried into measures for his\nown preservation."

He undressed the\ncorpse that lay bleeding among the straw, and, conveying it to the bed\nin his arms, deposited it in the attitude of a person who sleeps at his\nease; then he extinguished the light, took possession of the place from\nwhence the body had been removed, and, holding a pistol ready cocked in\neach hand, waited for the sequel with that determined purpose which is\noften the immediate production of despair. About midnight he heard the\nsound of feet ascending the ladder; the door was softly opened; he saw\nthe shadow of two men stalking towards the bed, a dark lanthorn being\nunshrouded, directed their aim to the supposed sleeper, and he that\nheld it thrust a poniard to his heart; the force of the blow made a\ncompression on the chest, and a sort of groan issued from the windpipe\nof the defunct; the stroke was repeated, without producing a repetition\nof the note, so that the assassins concluded the work was effectually\ndone, and retired for the present with a design to return and rifle the\ndeceased at their leisure.Never had our hero spent a moment in such agony as he felt during this\noperation; the whole surface of his body was covered with a cold sweat,\nand his nerves were relaxed with an universal palsy. In short, he\nremained in a trance that, in all probability, contributed to his\nsafety; for, had he retained the use of his senses, he might have been\ndiscovered by the transports of his fear. The first use he made of his\nretrieved recollection, was to perceive that the assassins had left the\ndoor open in their retreat; and he would have instantly availed himself\nof this their neglect, by sallying out upon them, at the hazard of his\nlife, had he not been restrained by a conversation he overheard in the\nroom below, importing, that the ruffians were going to set out upon\nanother expedition, in hopes of finding more prey. They accordingly\ndeparted, after having laid strong injunctions upon the old woman to\nkeep the door fast locked during their absence; and Ferdinand took his\nresolution without farther delay. So soon as, by his conjecture, the\nrobbers were at a sufficient distance from the house, he rose from his\nlurking-place, moved softly towards the bed, and, rummaging the pockets\nof the deceased, found a purse well stored with ducats, of which,\ntogether with a silver watch and a diamond ring, he immediately\npossessed himself without scruple; then, descending with great care and\ncircumspection into the lower apartment, stood before the old beldame,\nbefore she had the least intimation of his approach."

Nor did her anxiety abate, when she was\nundeceived in this her supposition, and understood it was no phantom,\nbut the real substance of the stranger, who, without staying to upbraid\nher with the enormity of her crimes, commanded her, on pain of\nimmediate death, to produce his horse, to which being conducted, he set\nher upon the saddle without delay, and, mounting behind, invested her\nwith the management of the reins, swearing, in a most peremptory tone,\nthat the only chance she had for her life, was in directing him safely\nto the next town; and that, so soon as she should give him the least\ncause to doubt her fidelity in the performance of that task, he would\non the instant act the part of her executioner.This declaration had its effect upon the withered Hecate, who, with\nmany supplications for mercy and forgiveness, promised to guide him in\nsafety to a certain village at the distance of two leagues, where he\nmight lodge in security, and be provided with a fresh horse, or other\nconvenience, for pursuing his intended route. On these conditions he\ntold her she might deserve his clemency; and they accordingly took\ntheir departure together, she being placed astride upon the saddle,\nholding the bridle in one hand and a switch in the other; and our\nadventurer sitting on the crupper, superintending her conduct, and\nkeeping the muzzle of a pistol close at her ear. In this equipage they\ntravelled across part of the same wood in which his guide had forsaken\nhim; and it is not to be supposed that he passed his time in the most\nagreeable reverie, while he found himself involved in the labyrinth of\nthose shades, which he considered as the haunts of robbery and\nassassination.Common fear was a comfortable sensation to what he felt in this\nexcursion. The first steps he had taken for his preservation were the\neffects of mere instinct, while his faculties were extinguished or\nsuppressed by despair; but now, as his reflection began to recur, he\nwas haunted by the most intolerable apprehensions. Every whisper of the\nwind through the thickets was swelled into the hoarse menaces of\nmurder, the shaking of the boughs was construed into the brandishing of\nponiards, and every shadow of a tree became the apparition of a ruffian\neager for blood. In short, at each of these occurrences he felt what\nwas infinitely more tormenting than the stab of a real dagger; and at\nevery fresh fillip of his fear, he acted as a remembrancer to his\nconductress, in a new volley of imprecations, importing, that her life\nwas absolutely connected with his opinion of his own safety."

He then began to exercise his\nthoughts upon a new subject. He debated with himself, whether he should\nmake a parade of his intrepidity and public spirit, by disclosing his\nachievement, and surrendering his guide to the penalty of the law; or\nleave the old hag and her accomplices to the remorse of their own\nconsciences, and proceed quietly on his journey to Paris in undisturbed\npossession of the prize he had already obtained. This last step he\ndetermined to take, upon recollecting, that, in the course of his\ninformation, the story of the murdered stranger would infallibly\nattract the attention of justice, and, in that case, the effects he had\nborrowed from the defunct must be refunded for the benefit of those who\nhad a right to the succession. This was an argument which our\nadventurer could not resist; he foresaw that he should be stripped of\nhis acquisition, which he looked upon as the fair fruits of his valour\nand sagacity; and, moreover, be detained as an evidence against the\nrobbers, to the manifest detriment of his affairs. Perhaps too he had\nmotives of conscience, that dissuaded him from bearing witness against\na set of people whose principles did not much differ from his own.Influenced by such considerations, he yielded to the first importunity\nof the beldame, whom he dismissed at a very small distance from the\nvillage, after he had earnestly exhorted her to quit such an atrocious\ncourse of life, and atone for her past crimes, by sacrificing her\nassociates to the demands of justice. She did not fail to vow a perfect\nreformation, and to prostrate herself before him for the favour she had\nfound; then she betook herself to her habitation, with full purpose of\nadvising her fellow-murderers to repair with all despatch to the\nvillage, and impeach our hero, who, wisely distrusting her professions,\nstayed no longer in the place than to hire a guide for the next stage,\nwhich brought him to the city of Chalons-sur-Marne.CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOHE ARRIVES AT PARIS, AND IS PLEASED WITH HIS RECEPTION.He was not so smitten with the delightful situation of this ancient\ntown, but that he abandoned it as soon as he could procure a\npost-chaise, in which he arrived at Paris, without having been exposed\nto any other troublesome adventure upon the road. He took lodgings at a\ncertain hotel in the Fauxbourg de St. Germain, which is the general\nrendezvous of all the strangers that resort to this capital; and now\nsincerely congratulated himself upon his happy escape from his\nHungarian connexions, and from the snares of the banditti, as well as\nupon the spoils of the dead body, and his arrival at Paris, from whence\nthere was such a short conveyance to England, whither he was attracted,\nby far other motives than that of filial veneration for his native\nsoil."
