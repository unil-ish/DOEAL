Though this translation was not at\nall to our hero’s liking, he was forced to acquiesce in his fate, glad\nto find himself, on these terms, in possession of his effects, of which\nhe would otherwise have been infallibly rifled.This campaign, however, was the most disagreeable period of his whole\nlife; because the manner in which he had entered into the service\nsubjected him to the particular observation and notice of the French\nofficers; so that he was obliged to be very alert in his duty, and\nsummon all his fortitude to maintain the character he had assumed. What\nrendered his situation still more unpalatable, was the activity of both\narmies in the course of this season, during which, over and above\nsundry fatiguing marches and countermarches, he was personally engaged\nin the affair of Halleh, which was very obstinate; where, being in the\nskirts of the detachment, he was actually wounded in the face by the\nsword of an hussar; but this was, luckily for him, the last time he\nfound himself under the necessity of exerting his military prowess, for\na cessation of arms was proclaimed before he was cured of his wound,\nand peace concluded about the end of the campaign."

  "content": "During his sojourn in the French camp, he assumed the character of a\nman of family, who being disgusted at some supercilious treatment he\nhad met with in the German service, and at the same time ambitious of\ncarrying arms under the banners of France, took the opportunity of\nretreating by stealth from his friends, accompanied only by one with\nwhom he could intrust his intention. In this capacity he had managed\nhis matters to such advantage, that many French officers of rank were\nvery well disposed to contribute their interest in his behalf, had his\ninclination verged towards promotion in the army; but he thought proper\nto conceal his real design, under the specious pretext of longing to\nsee the metropolis of France, that centre of pleasure and politeness,\nin which he proposed to spend some time for the improvement of his\naddress and understanding. These were motives too laudable to be\nopposed by his new patrons, some of whom furnished him with letters of\nrecommendation to certain noblemen of the first rank at the court of\nVersailles, for which place he and his companion set out from the banks\nof the Rhine, very well satisfied with the honourable dismission they\nhad obtained from a life of inconvenience, danger, and alarm.CHAPTER TWENTYHE PREPARES A STRATAGEM BUT FINDS HIMSELF COUNTERMINED—PROCEEDS ON HIS\nJOURNEY, AND IS OVERTAKEN BY A TERRIBLE TEMPEST.In the course of this journey, Ferdinand, who was never deficient in\nhis political capacity, held a secret conclave with his own thoughts,\nnot only touching the plan of his own future conduct, but also\nconcerning his associate, of whose fidelity and adherence he began to\nentertain such doubts as discouraged him from the prosecution of that\ndesign in which the Tyrolese had been at first included; for he had\nlately observed him practise the arts of his occupation among the\nFrench officers, with such rapacity and want of caution, as indicated a\ndangerous temerity of temper, as well as a furious rage of acquiring,\nwhich might be some time or other satiated upon his own friends. In\nother words, our adventurer was afraid that his accomplice would profit\nby his knowledge of the road and countries through which they\ntravelled, and, after having made free with his most valuable effects,\nin consequence of the familiarity subsisting between them, leave him\nsome morning without the ceremony of a formal adieu."

  "content": "Aroused by this suspicion, he resolved to anticipate the supposed\nintention of the Tyrolese, by taking his own departure in the same\nabrupt manner; and this scheme he actually put in execution, upon their\narrival in Bar-le-duc, where it was agreed they should spend a day to\nrepose and refresh themselves from the fatigue of hard riding.\nFerdinand, therefore, taking the advantage of his companion’s\nabsence—for the Tyrolese had walked abroad to view the town—found means\nto hire a peasant, who undertook to conduct him through a by-road as\nfar as Chalons, and with his guide he accordingly set out on horseback,\nafter having discharged the bill, left a blank paper sealed up in form\nof a letter, directed to his friend, and secured behind his own saddle\na pair of leathern bags, in which his jewels and cash were usually\ncontained. So eager was our hero to leave the Tyrolese at a\nconsiderable distance behind, that he rode all night at a round pace\nwithout halting, and next morning found himself at a village distant\nthirteen good leagues from any part of the route which he and his\ncompanion had at first resolved to pursue.Here, thinking himself safely delivered from the cause of all his\napprehension, he determined to lie incognito for a few days, so as that\nhe might run no risk of an accidental meeting upon the road with the\nperson whose company he had forsaken; and accordingly took possession\nof an apartment, in which he went to rest, desiring his guide to wake\nhim when dinner should be ready. Having enjoyed a very comfortable\nrefreshment of sleep, with his bags under his pillow, he was summoned,\naccording to his direction, and ate a very hearty meal, with great\ntranquillity and internal satisfaction. In the afternoon he amused\nhimself with happy presages and ideal prospects of his future fortune,\nand, in the midst of these imaginary banquets, was seized with an\ninclination of realising his bliss, and regaling his eyesight with the\nfruits of that success which had hitherto attended his endeavours. Thus\ninflamed, he opened the repository, and, O reader! what were his\nreflections, when, in lieu of Mademoiselle Melvil’s ear-rings and\nnecklace, the German’s golden chain, divers jewels of considerable\nvalue, the spoils of sundry dupes, and about two hundred ducats in\nready money, he found neither more nor less than a parcel of rusty\nnails, disposed in such a manner as to resemble in weight and bulk the\nmoveables he had lost."

  "content": "It is not to be supposed our adventurer made this discovery without\nemotion. If the eternal salvation of mankind could have been purchased\nfor the tenth part of his treasure, he would have left the whole\nspecies in a state of reprobation, rather than redeem them at that\nprice, unless he had seen in the bargain some evident advantage to his\nown concerns. One may, therefore, easily conceive with what milkiness\nof resignation he bore the loss of the whole, and saw himself reduced\nfrom such affluence to the necessity of depending upon about twenty\nducats, and some loose silver, which he carried in his pocket, for his\nexpense upon the road. However bitter this pill might be in swallowing,\nhe so far mastered his mortification, as to digest it with a good\ngrace. His own penetration at once pointed out the canal through which\nthis misfortune had flowed upon him; he forthwith placed the calamity\nto the account of the Tyrolese, and never doubting that he had retired\nwith the booty across the Rhine, into some place to which he knew\nFathom would not follow his footsteps, he formed the melancholy\nresolution of pursuing with all despatch his journey to Paris, that he\nmight, with all convenient expedition, indemnify himself for the\ndiscomfiture he had sustained.With regard to his confederate, his conjecture was perfectly right;\nthat adventurer, though infinitely inferior to our hero in point of\ngenius and invention, had manifestly the advantage of him in the\narticles of age and experience; he was no stranger to Fathom’s\nqualifications, the happy exertion of which he had often seen. He knew\nhim to be an economist of the most frugal order, consequently concluded\nhis finances were worthy of examination; and, upon the true principles\nof a sharper, eased him of the encumbrance, taking it for granted,\nthat, in so doing, he only precluded Ferdinand from the power of acting\nthe same tragedy upon him, should ever opportunity concur with his\ninclination. He had therefore concerted his measures with the dexterity\nof an experienced conveyancer, and, snatching the occasion, while our\nhero, travel-tainted, lay sunk in the arms of profound repose, he\nripped up the seams of the leather depository, withdrew the contents,\nintroduced the parcel of nails, which he had made up for the purpose,\nand then repaired the breach with great deliberation.Had Fathom’s good genius prompted him to examine his effects next\nmorning, the Tyrolese, in all probability, would have maintained his\nacquisition by force of arms; for his personal courage was rather more\ndetermined than that of our adventurer, and he was conscious of his own\nascendency in this particular; but his good fortune prevented such\nexplanation. Immediately after dinner, he availed himself of his\nknowledge, and, betaking himself to a remote part of the town, set out\nin a post-chaise for Luneville, while our hero was meditating his own\nescape."

  "content": "Fathom’s conception was sufficient to comprehend the whole of this\nadventure, as soon as his chagrin would give his sagacity fair play;\nnor would he allow his resolution to sink under the trial; on the\ncontrary, he departed from the village that same afternoon, under the\nauspices of his conductor, and found himself benighted in the midst of\na forest, far from the habitations of men. The darkness of the night,\nthe silence and solitude of the place, the indistinct images of the\ntrees that appeared on every side, “stretching their extravagant arms\nathwart the gloom,” conspired, with the dejection of spirits occasioned\nby his loss, to disturb his fancy, and raise strange phantoms in his\nimagination. Although he was not naturally superstitious, his mind\nbegan to be invaded with an awful horror, that gradually prevailed over\nall the consolations of reason and philosophy; nor was his heart free\nfrom the terrors of assassination. In order to dissipate these\ndisagreeable reveries, he had recourse to the conversation of his\nguide, by whom he was entertained with the history of divers travellers\nwho had been robbed and murdered by ruffians, whose retreat was in the\nrecesses of that very wood.In the midst of this communication, which did not at all tend to the\nelevation of our hero’s spirits, the conductor made an excuse for\ndropping behind, while our traveller jogged on in expectation of being\njoined again by him in a few minutes. He was, however, disappointed in\nthat hope; the sound of the other horse’s feet by degrees grew more and\nmore faint, and at last altogether died away. Alarmed at this\ncircumstance, Fathom halted in the middle of the road, and listened\nwith the most fearful attention; but his sense of hearing was saluted\nwith nought but the dismal sighings of the trees, that seemed to\nforetell an approaching storm. Accordingly, the heavens contracted a\nmore dreary aspect, the lightning began to gleam, and the thunder to\nroll, and the tempest, raising its voice to a tremendous roar,\ndescended in a torrent of rain.In this emergency, the fortitude of our hero was almost quite overcome.\nSo many concurring circumstances of danger and distress might have\nappalled the most undaunted breast; what impression then must they have\nmade upon the mind of Ferdinand, who was by no means a man to set fear\nat defiance! Indeed, he had well-nigh lost the use of his reflection,\nand was actually invaded to the skin, before he could recollect himself\nso far as to quit the road, and seek for shelter among the thickets\nthat surrounded him. Having rode some furlongs into the forest, he took\nhis station under a tuft of tall trees, that screened him from the\nstorm, and in that situation called a council within himself, to\ndeliberate upon his next excursion. He persuaded himself that his guide\nhad deserted him for the present, in order to give intelligence of a\ntraveller to some gang of robbers with whom he was connected; and that\nhe must of necessity fall a prey to those banditti, unless he should\nhave the good fortune to elude their search, and disentangle himself\nfrom the mazes of the wood."

For this purpose he turned his horse’s head\nin a line quite contrary to the direction of the high road which he had\nleft, on the supposition that the robbers would pursue that track in\nquest of him, and that they would never dream of his deserting the\nhighway, to traverse an unknown forest, amidst the darkness of such a\nboisterous night. After he had continued in this progress through a\nsuccession of groves, and bogs, and thorns, and brakes, by which not\nonly his clothes, but also his skin suffered in a grievous manner,\nwhile every nerve quivered with eagerness and dismay, he at length\nreached an open plain, and pursuing his course, in full hope of\narriving at some village, where his life would be safe, he descried a\nrush-light at a distance, which he looked upon as the star of his good\nfortune, and riding towards it at full speed, arrived at the door of a\nlone cottage, into which he was admitted by an old woman, who,\nunderstanding he was a bewildered traveller, received him with great\nhospitality.When he learned from his hostess, that there was not another house\nwithin three leagues; that she could accommodate him with a tolerable\nbed, and his horse with lodging and oats, he thanked Heaven for his\ngood fortune, in stumbling upon this homely habitation, and determined\nto pass the night under the protection of the old cottager, who gave\nhim to understand, that her husband, who was a faggot-maker, had gone\nto the next town to dispose of his merchandise; and that, in all\nprobability, he would not return till next morning, on account of the\ntempestuous night. Ferdinand sounded the beldame with a thousand artful\ninterrogations, and she answered with such appearance of truth and\nsimplicity, that he concluded his person was quite secure; and, after\nhaving been regaled with a dish of eggs and bacon, desired she would\nconduct him into the chamber where she proposed he should take his\nrepose. He was accordingly ushered up by a sort of ladder into an\napartment furnished with a standing-bed, and almost half filled with\ntrusses of straw. He seemed extremely well pleased with his lodging,\nwhich in reality exceeded his expectation; and his kind landlady,\ncautioning him against letting the candle approach the combustibles,\ntook her leave, and locked the door on the outside.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEHE FALLS UPON SCYLLA, SEEKING TO AVOID CHARYBDIS."

In consequence of these suggestions, he\nproposed to take an accurate survey of every object in the apartment,\nand, in the course of his inquiry, had the mortification to find the\ndead body of a man, still warm, who had been lately stabbed, and\nconcealed beneath several bundles of straw.Such a discovery could not fail to fill the breast of our hero with\nunspeakable horror; for he concluded that he himself would undergo the\nsame fate before morning, without the interposition of a miracle in his\nfavour. In the first transports of his dread, he ran to the window,\nwith a view to escape by that outlet, and found his flight effectually\nobstructed by divers strong bars of iron. Then his heart began to\npalpitate, his hair to bristle up, and his knees to totter; his\nthoughts teemed with presages of death and destruction; his conscience\nrose up in judgment against him, and he underwent a severe paroxysm of\ndismay and distraction. His spirits were agitated into a state of\nfermentation that produced a species of resolution akin to that which\nis inspired by brandy or other strong liquors, and, by an impulse that\nseemed supernatural, he was immediately hurried into measures for his\nown preservation."

He undressed the\ncorpse that lay bleeding among the straw, and, conveying it to the bed\nin his arms, deposited it in the attitude of a person who sleeps at his\nease; then he extinguished the light, took possession of the place from\nwhence the body had been removed, and, holding a pistol ready cocked in\neach hand, waited for the sequel with that determined purpose which is\noften the immediate production of despair. About midnight he heard the\nsound of feet ascending the ladder; the door was softly opened; he saw\nthe shadow of two men stalking towards the bed, a dark lanthorn being\nunshrouded, directed their aim to the supposed sleeper, and he that\nheld it thrust a poniard to his heart; the force of the blow made a\ncompression on the chest, and a sort of groan issued from the windpipe\nof the defunct; the stroke was repeated, without producing a repetition\nof the note, so that the assassins concluded the work was effectually\ndone, and retired for the present with a design to return and rifle the\ndeceased at their leisure.Never had our hero spent a moment in such agony as he felt during this\noperation; the whole surface of his body was covered with a cold sweat,\nand his nerves were relaxed with an universal palsy. In short, he\nremained in a trance that, in all probability, contributed to his\nsafety; for, had he retained the use of his senses, he might have been\ndiscovered by the transports of his fear. The first use he made of his\nretrieved recollection, was to perceive that the assassins had left the\ndoor open in their retreat; and he would have instantly availed himself\nof this their neglect, by sallying out upon them, at the hazard of his\nlife, had he not been restrained by a conversation he overheard in the\nroom below, importing, that the ruffians were going to set out upon\nanother expedition, in hopes of finding more prey. They accordingly\ndeparted, after having laid strong injunctions upon the old woman to\nkeep the door fast locked during their absence; and Ferdinand took his\nresolution without farther delay. So soon as, by his conjecture, the\nrobbers were at a sufficient distance from the house, he rose from his\nlurking-place, moved softly towards the bed, and, rummaging the pockets\nof the deceased, found a purse well stored with ducats, of which,\ntogether with a silver watch and a diamond ring, he immediately\npossessed himself without scruple; then, descending with great care and\ncircumspection into the lower apartment, stood before the old beldame,\nbefore she had the least intimation of his approach."

Nor did her anxiety abate, when she was\nundeceived in this her supposition, and understood it was no phantom,\nbut the real substance of the stranger, who, without staying to upbraid\nher with the enormity of her crimes, commanded her, on pain of\nimmediate death, to produce his horse, to which being conducted, he set\nher upon the saddle without delay, and, mounting behind, invested her\nwith the management of the reins, swearing, in a most peremptory tone,\nthat the only chance she had for her life, was in directing him safely\nto the next town; and that, so soon as she should give him the least\ncause to doubt her fidelity in the performance of that task, he would\non the instant act the part of her executioner.This declaration had its effect upon the withered Hecate, who, with\nmany supplications for mercy and forgiveness, promised to guide him in\nsafety to a certain village at the distance of two leagues, where he\nmight lodge in security, and be provided with a fresh horse, or other\nconvenience, for pursuing his intended route. On these conditions he\ntold her she might deserve his clemency; and they accordingly took\ntheir departure together, she being placed astride upon the saddle,\nholding the bridle in one hand and a switch in the other; and our\nadventurer sitting on the crupper, superintending her conduct, and\nkeeping the muzzle of a pistol close at her ear. In this equipage they\ntravelled across part of the same wood in which his guide had forsaken\nhim; and it is not to be supposed that he passed his time in the most\nagreeable reverie, while he found himself involved in the labyrinth of\nthose shades, which he considered as the haunts of robbery and\nassassination.Common fear was a comfortable sensation to what he felt in this\nexcursion. The first steps he had taken for his preservation were the\neffects of mere instinct, while his faculties were extinguished or\nsuppressed by despair; but now, as his reflection began to recur, he\nwas haunted by the most intolerable apprehensions. Every whisper of the\nwind through the thickets was swelled into the hoarse menaces of\nmurder, the shaking of the boughs was construed into the brandishing of\nponiards, and every shadow of a tree became the apparition of a ruffian\neager for blood. In short, at each of these occurrences he felt what\nwas infinitely more tormenting than the stab of a real dagger; and at\nevery fresh fillip of his fear, he acted as a remembrancer to his\nconductress, in a new volley of imprecations, importing, that her life\nwas absolutely connected with his opinion of his own safety."

He then began to exercise his\nthoughts upon a new subject. He debated with himself, whether he should\nmake a parade of his intrepidity and public spirit, by disclosing his\nachievement, and surrendering his guide to the penalty of the law; or\nleave the old hag and her accomplices to the remorse of their own\nconsciences, and proceed quietly on his journey to Paris in undisturbed\npossession of the prize he had already obtained. This last step he\ndetermined to take, upon recollecting, that, in the course of his\ninformation, the story of the murdered stranger would infallibly\nattract the attention of justice, and, in that case, the effects he had\nborrowed from the defunct must be refunded for the benefit of those who\nhad a right to the succession. This was an argument which our\nadventurer could not resist; he foresaw that he should be stripped of\nhis acquisition, which he looked upon as the fair fruits of his valour\nand sagacity; and, moreover, be detained as an evidence against the\nrobbers, to the manifest detriment of his affairs. Perhaps too he had\nmotives of conscience, that dissuaded him from bearing witness against\na set of people whose principles did not much differ from his own.Influenced by such considerations, he yielded to the first importunity\nof the beldame, whom he dismissed at a very small distance from the\nvillage, after he had earnestly exhorted her to quit such an atrocious\ncourse of life, and atone for her past crimes, by sacrificing her\nassociates to the demands of justice. She did not fail to vow a perfect\nreformation, and to prostrate herself before him for the favour she had\nfound; then she betook herself to her habitation, with full purpose of\nadvising her fellow-murderers to repair with all despatch to the\nvillage, and impeach our hero, who, wisely distrusting her professions,\nstayed no longer in the place than to hire a guide for the next stage,\nwhich brought him to the city of Chalons-sur-Marne.CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOHE ARRIVES AT PARIS, AND IS PLEASED WITH HIS RECEPTION.He was not so smitten with the delightful situation of this ancient\ntown, but that he abandoned it as soon as he could procure a\npost-chaise, in which he arrived at Paris, without having been exposed\nto any other troublesome adventure upon the road. He took lodgings at a\ncertain hotel in the Fauxbourg de St. Germain, which is the general\nrendezvous of all the strangers that resort to this capital; and now\nsincerely congratulated himself upon his happy escape from his\nHungarian connexions, and from the snares of the banditti, as well as\nupon the spoils of the dead body, and his arrival at Paris, from whence\nthere was such a short conveyance to England, whither he was attracted,\nby far other motives than that of filial veneration for his native\nsoil."

He accordingly hired an occasional domestic, and under\nthe denomination of Count Fathom, which he had retained since his\nelopement from Renaldo, repaired to dinner at an ordinary, to which he\nwas directed as a reputable place, frequented by fashionable strangers\nof all nations.He found this piece of information perfectly just; for he no sooner\nentered the apartment, than his ears were saluted with a strange\nconfusion of sounds, among which he at once distinguished the High and\nLow Dutch, barbarous French, Italian, and English languages. He was\nrejoiced at this occasion of displaying his own qualifications, took\nhis place at one of the three long tables, betwixt a Westphalian count\nand a Bolognian marquis, insinuated himself into the conversation with\nhis usual address, and in less than half an hour, found means to accost\na native of each different country in his own mother-tongue.Such extensive knowledge did not pass unobserved. A French abbe, in a\nprovincial dialect, complimented him upon his retaining that purity in\npronunciation, which is not to be found in the speech of a Parisian.\nThe Bolognian, mistaking him for a Tuscan, “Sir,” said he, “I presume\nyou are from Florence.

The templar\nis, generally speaking, a prig, so is the abbe: both are distinguished\nby an air of petulance and self-conceit, which holds a middle rank\nbetwixt the insolence of a first-rate buck and the learned pride of a\nsupercilious pedant. The abbe is supposed to be a younger brother in\nquest of preferment in the church—the Temple is considered as a\nreceptacle or seminary for younger sons intended for the bar; but a\ngreat number of each profession turn aside into other paths of life,\nlong before they reach these proposed goals. An abbe is often\nmetamorphosed into a foot soldier; a templar sometimes sinks into an\nattorney’s clerk. The galleys of France abound with abbes; and many\ntemplars may be found in our American plantations; not to mention those\nwho have made a public exit nearer home. Yet I would not have it\nthought that my description includes every individual of those\nsocieties. Some of the greatest scholars, politicians, and wits, that\never Europe produced, have worn the habit of an abbe; and many of our\nmost noble families in England derive their honours from those who have\nstudied law in the Temple. The worthy sons of every community shall\nalways be sacred from my censure and ridicule; and, while I laugh at\nthe folly of particular members, I can still honour and revere the\ninstitution.But let us return from this comparison, which some readers may think\nimpertinent and unseasonable, and observe, that the Westphalian count,\nDutch officer, and English knight, were not excepted from the\nparticular regard and attention of our adventurer. He pledged the\nGerman in every bumper; flattered the Hollander with compliments upon\nthe industry, wealth, and policy of the Seven United Provinces; but he\nreserved his chief battery for his own countryman, on the supposition\nthat he was, in all respects, the best adapted for the purposes of a\nneedy gamester. Him, therefore, he cultivated with extraordinary care\nand singular observance; for he soon perceived him to be a humourist,\nand, from that circumstance, derived an happy presage of his own\nsuccess. The baronet’s disposition seemed to be cast in the true\nEnglish mould. He was sour, silent, and contemptuous; his very looks\nindicated a consciousness of superior wealth; and he never opened his\nmouth, except to make some dry, sarcastic, national reflection. Nor was\nhis behaviour free from that air of suspicion which a man puts on when\nhe believes himself in a crowd of pick-pockets, whom his caution and\nvigilance set at defiance. In a word, though his tongue was silent on\nthe subject, his whole demeanour was continually saying, “You are all a\npack of poor lousy rascals, who have a design upon my purse. ’Tis true,\nI could buy your whole generation, but I won’t be bubbled, d’ye see; I\nam aware of your flattery, and upon my guard against all your knavish\npranks; and I come into your company for my own amusement only.”"

This he conceived to be the\nbest method of acquiring his good opinion; because the Englishman would\nnaturally conclude he was a person who could have no sinister views\nupon his fortune, else he would have chosen quite a different manner of\ndeportment. Accordingly, the knight seemed to bite at the hook. He\nlistened to Ferdinand with uncommon regard; he was even heard to\ncommend his remarks, and at length drank to their better acquaintance.CHAPTER TWENTY-THREEACQUITS HIMSELF WITH ADDRESS IN A NOCTURNAL RIOT.The Italian and the abbe were the first who began to grow whimsical\nunder the influence of the burgundy; and, in the heat of their\nelevation, proposed that the company should amuse themselves during the\nremaining part of the night, at the house of an obliging dame, who\nmaintained a troop of fair nymphs for the accommodation of the other\nsex. The proposal was approved by all, except the Hollander, whose\neconomy the wine had not as yet invaded; and, while he retreated\nsoberly to his own lodgings, the rest of the society adjourned in two\ncoaches to the temple of love, where they were received by the\nvenerable priestess, a personage turned of seventy, who seemed to\nexercise the functions of her calling, in despite of the most cruel\nravages of time; for age had bent her into the form of a Turkish bow.\nHer head was agitated by the palsy, like the leaf of the poplar tree;\nher hair fell down in scanty parcels, as white as the driven snow; her\nface was not simply wrinkled, but ploughed into innumerable furrows;\nher jaws could not boast of one remaining tooth; one eye distilled a\nlarge quantity of rheum, by virtue of the fiery edge that surrounded\nit; the other was altogether extinguished, and she had lost her nose in\nthe course of her ministration. The Delphic sibyl was but a type of\nthis hoary matron, who, by her figure, might have been mistaken for the\nconsort of Chaos, or mother of Time. Yet there was something\nmeritorious in her appearance, as it denoted her an indefatigable\nminister to the pleasure of mankind, and as it formed an agreeable\ncontrast with the beauty and youth of the fair damsels that wantoned in\nher train. It resembled those discords in music, which, properly\ndisposed, contribute to the harmony of the whole piece; or those\nhorrible giants, who, in the world of romance, used to guard the gates\nof the castle in which the enchanted damsel was confined."

Then a lacquey, in magnificent livery,\nushered them into a superb apartment, where they waited some minutes,\nwithout being favoured with the appearance of the ladies, to the\nmanifest dissatisfaction of the abbe, who, sending for the gouvernante,\nreprimanded her severely for her want of politesse. The old lady, who\nwas by no means a pattern of patience and submission, retorted his\nreproaches with great emphasis and vivacity. Her eloquence flowed\naltogether in the Covent Garden strain; and I question whether the\ncelebrated Mother Douglas herself could have made such a figure in an\nextemporaneous altercation.After having bestowed upon the abbe the epithets of saucy insignificant\npimp, she put him in mind of the good offices which he had received at\nher hands; how she had supplied him with bed, board, and bedfellow, in\nhis greatest necessity; sent him abroad with money in his pockets—and,\nin a word, cherished him in her bosom, when his own mother had\nabandoned him to distress. She then reviled him for presuming to\naffront her before strangers, and gave the company to understand, that\nthe young ladies would wait upon them as soon as they could be\nconfessed and receive absolution from a worthy cordelier, who was now\nemployed in performing that charitable office. The gentlemen were\nsatisfied with this remonstrance, which argued the old lady’s pious\nconcern for the souls that were under her care, and our adventurer\nproposed an accommodation betwixt her and the abbe, who was prevailed\nupon to ask her pardon, and received her blessing upon his knees.This affair had not been long adjusted, when five damsels were\nintroduced in a very gay dishabille, and our hero was complimented with\nthe privilege of choosing his Amanda from the whole bevy. When he was\nprovided, the others began to pair themselves, and, unhappily, the\nGerman count chanced to pitch upon the same nymph who had captivated\nthe desires of the British knight. A dispute immediately ensued; for\nthe Englishman made his addresses to the lady, without paying the least\nregard to the priority of the other’s claim; and she, being pleased\nwith his attachment, did not scruple to renounce his rival, who swore\nby the thunder, lightning, and sacrament, that he would not quit his\npretensions for any prince in Christendom, much less for a little\nEnglish cavalier, whom he had already honoured too much in\ncondescending to be his companion."

  "content": "The knight, provoked at this stately declaration, which was the\nimmediate effect of anger and ebriety, eyed his antagonist with a most\ncontemptuous aspect, and advised him to avoid such comparisons for the\nfuture. “We all know,” said he, “the importance of a German count; I\nsuppose your revenue amounts to three hundred rix-dollars; and you have\na chateau that looks like the ruins of an English gaol. I will bind\nmyself to lend you a thousand pounds upon a mortgage of your estate,\n(and a bad bargain I am sure I shall have,) if I do not, in less than\ntwo months, find a yeoman of Kent, who spends more in strong ale than\nthe sum-total of your yearly income; and, were the truth known, I\nbelieve that lace upon your coat is no better than tinsel, and those\nfringed ruffles, with fine Holland sleeves, tacked to a shirt of brown\ncanvas, so that, were you to undress yourself before the lady, you\nwould only expose your own poverty and pride.”The count was so much enraged at these sarcastic observations, that his\nfaculty of speech was overwhelmed by his resentment; though, in order\nto acquit himself of the Englishman’s imputation, he forthwith pulled\noff his clothes with such fury, that his brocade waistcoat was tore\nfrom top to bottom. The knight, mistaking his meaning, considered this\ndemeanour as a fair challenge, to try which was the better man in the\nexercise of boxing; and, on that supposition, began to strip in his\nturn, when he was undeceived by Fathom, who put the right\ninterpretation upon the count’s behaviour, and begged that the affair\nmight be compromised. By this time the Westphalian recovered the use of\nhis tongue, and with many threats and imprecations, desired they would\ntake notice how falsely he had been aspersed, and do him justice in\nespousing his claim to the damsel in question.Before the company had time or inclination to interest themselves in\nthe quarrel, his opponent observed that no person who was not a mere\nGerman, would ever dream of forcing the inclinations of a pretty girl,\nwhom the accidents of fortune had subjected to his power; that such\ncompulsion was equivalent to the most cruel rape that could be\ncommitted; and that the lady’s aversion was not at all surprising; for,\nto speak his own sentiments, were he a woman of pleasure, he would as\nsoon grant favours to a Westphalian hog, as to the person of his\nantagonist. The German, enraged at this comparison, was quite abandoned\nby his patience and discretion. He called the knight an English clown,\nand, swearing he was the most untoward beast of a whole nation of\nmules, snatched up one of the candlesticks, which he launched at him\nwith such force and violence, that it sung through the air, and,\nwinging its flight into the ante-chamber, encountered the skull of his\nown valet, who with immediate prostration received the message of his\nmaster."

  "content": "The knight, that he might not be behindhand with the Westphalian in\npoint of courtesy, returned the compliment with the remaining\nchandelier, which also missed its mark, and, smiting a large mirror\nthat was fixed behind them, emitted such a crash as one might expect to\nhear if a mine were sprung beneath a manufacture of glass. Both lights\nbeing thus extinguished, a furious combat ensued in the dark; the\nItalian scampered off with infinite agility, and, as he went\ndownstairs, desired that nobody would interpose, because it was an\naffair of honour, which could not be made up. The ladies consulted\ntheir safety in flight; Count Fathom slyly retired to one corner of the\nroom; while the abbe, having upon him the terrors of the commissaire,\nendeavoured to appease and part the combatants, and, in the attempt,\nsustained a random blow upon his nose, which sent him howling into the\nother chamber, where, finding his band besmeared with his own blood, he\nbegan to caper about the apartment, in a transport of rage and\nvexation.Meanwhile, the old gentlewoman being alarmed with the noise of the\nbattle, and apprehensive that it would end in murder, to the danger and\ndiscredit of herself and family, immediately mustered up her myrmidons,\nof whom she always retained a formidable band, and, putting herself at\ntheir head, lighted them to the scene of uproar. Ferdinand, who had\nhitherto observed a strict neutrality, no sooner perceived them\napproach, than he leaped in between the disputants, that he might be\nfound acting in the character of a peacemaker; and, indeed, by this\ntime, victory had declared for the baronet, who had treated his\nantagonist with a cross-buttock, which laid him almost breathless on\nthe floor. The victor was prevailed upon, by the entreaties of Fathom,\nto quit the field of battle, and adjourn into another room, where, in\nless than half an hour, he received a billet from the count, defying\nhim to single combat on the frontiers of Flanders, at an appointed time\nand place. The challenge was immediately accepted by the knight, who,\nbeing flushed with conquest, treated his adversary with great contempt.But, next day, when the fumes of the burgundy were quite exhaled, and\nthe adventure recurred to his remembrance and sober reflection, he\nwaited upon our adventurer at his lodgings, and solicited his advice in\nsuch a manner, as gave him to understand that he looked upon what had\nhappened as a drunken brawl, which ought to have no serious\nconsequences. Fathom foreseeing that the affair might be managed for\nhis own interest, professed himself of the baronet’s opinion; and,\nwithout hesitation, undertook the office of a mediator, assuring his\nprincipal, that his honour should suffer no stain in the course of his\nnegotiation."

Accordingly, his valet-de-chambre, pressed by Fathom’s\nimportunities and remonstrances, ventured to go in and shake the count\nby the shoulder; when this furious Teutonian, still agitated by the\nfever of the preceding night, leaped out of bed in a frenzy, and\nseizing his sword that lay upon a table, would have severely punished\nthe presumption of his servant, had not he been restrained by the\nentrance of Ferdinand, who, with a peremptory countenance, gave him to\nunderstand that the valet had acted at his immediate instigation; and\nthat he was come, as the Englishman’s friend, to concert with him\nproper measures for keeping the appointment they had made at their last\nmeeting.This message effectually calmed the German, who was not a little\nmortified to find himself so disagreeably disturbed. He could not help\ncursing the impatience of his antagonist, and even hinting that he\nwould have acted more like a gentleman and good Christian, in\nexpressing a desire of seeing the affair accommodated, as he knew\nhimself to be the aggressor, consequently the first offender against\nthe laws of politeness and good-fellowship. Fathom, finding him in a\nfit temper of mind, took the opportunity of assenting to the\nreasonableness of his observation. He ventured to condemn the\nimpetuosity of the baronet, who, he perceived, was extremely nice and\nscrupulous in the punctilios of honour; and said it was a pity that two\ngentlemen should forfeit each other’s friendship, much less expose\ntheir lives, for such a frivolous cause. “My dear count,” cried the\nWestphalian, “I am charmed to find your sentiments so conformable to my\nown. In an honourable cause, I despise all danger; my courage, thank\nHeaven! has been manifested in many public engagements as well as in\nprivate rencounters; but, to break with my friend, whose eminent\nvirtues I admire, and even to seek his life, on such a scandalous\noccasion, for a little insignificant w—-e, who, I suppose, took the\nadvantage of our intoxication, to foment the quarrel: by Heaven! my\nconscience cannot digest it.”"
