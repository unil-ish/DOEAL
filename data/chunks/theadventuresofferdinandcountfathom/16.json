  "content": "Here the light forsook Renaldo’s eyes, his knees knocked together, and\nhe fell at full length insensible on the floor. His valet, hearing the\nnoise, ran into the apartment, lifted him upon a couch, and despatched\na messenger for proper assistance, while he himself endeavoured to\nrecall his spirits by such applications as chance afforded. But before\nthe Count exhibited any signs of life, his brother-in-law entered his\nchamber by accident, and as soon as he recollected himself from the\nextreme confusion and concern produced by this melancholy spectacle, he\nperceived the fatal epistle, which Melvil, though insensible, still\nkept within his grasp; justly suspecting this to be the cause of that\nsevere paroxysm, he drew near the couch, and with difficulty read what\nis above rehearsed, and the sequel, to this effect:—“Yes, I have taken such measures as will prevent it from falling into\nyour hands, until after I shall have been released from a being\nembittered with inexpressible misery and anguish. It is not my\nintention, once loved, and ah! still too fondly remembered youth, to\nupbraid you as the source of that unceasing woe which hath been so long\nthe sole inhabitant of my lonely bosom. I will not call you inconstant\nor unkind. I dare not think you base or dishonourable; yet I was\nabruptly sacrificed to a triumphant rival, before I had learned to bear\nsuch mortification; before I had overcome the prejudices which I had\nimbibed in my father’s house. I was all at once abandoned to despair,\nto indigence, and distress, to the vile practices of a villain, who, I\nfear, hath betrayed us both. What have not I suffered from the insults\nand vicious designs of that wretch, whom you cherished in your bosom!\nYet to these I owe this near approach to that goal of peace, where the\ncanker-worm of sorrow will expire. Beware of that artful traitor; and,\noh! endeavour to overcome that levity of disposition, which, if\nindulged, will not only stain your reputation, but also debauch the\ngood qualities of your heart. I release you, in the sight of Heaven,\nfrom all obligations. If I have been injured, let not my wrongs be\nvisited on the head of Renaldo, for whom shall be offered up the last\nfervent prayers of the hapless Monimia.”"

  "content": "This letter was a clue to the labyrinth of Melvil’s distress. Though\nthe Major had never heard him mention the name of this beauty, he had\nreceived such hints from his own wife, as enabled him to comprehend the\nwhole of the Count’s disaster. By the administration of stimulating\nmedicines, Renaldo recovered his perception; but this was a cruel\nalternative, considering the situation of his thoughts. The first word\nhe pronounced was Monimia, with all the emphasis of the most violent\ndespair. He perused the letter, and poured forth incoherent execrations\nagainst Fathom and himself. He exclaimed, in a frantic tone, “She is\nlost for ever! murdered by my unkindness! We are both undone by the\ninfernal arts of Fathom! execrable monster! Restore her to my arms. If\nthou art not a fiend in reality, I will tear out thy false heart.”So saying, he sprung upon his valet, who would have fallen a sacrifice\nto his undistinguishing fury, had not he been saved by the\ninterposition of Farrel and the family, who disengaged him from his\nmaster’s gripe by dint of force; yet, notwithstanding their joint\nendeavours, he broke from this restraint, leaped upon the floor, and\nseizing his sword, attempted to plunge it in his own breast. When he\nwas once more overcome by numbers, he cursed himself, and all those who\nwithheld him; swore he would not survive the fair victim who had\nperished by his credulity and indiscretion; and the agitation of his\nspirits increased to such a degree, that he was seized with strong\nconvulsions, which nature was scarce able to sustain. Every medical\nexpedient was used to quiet his perturbation, which at length yielded\nso far as to subside into a continual fever and confirmed delirium,\nduring which he ceased not to pour forth the most pathetic complaints,\ntouching his ruined love, and to rave about the ill-starred Monimia.\nThe Major, half distracted by the calamity of his friend, would have\nconcealed it from the knowledge of his family, had not the physician,\nby despairing of his life, laid him under the necessity of making them\nacquainted with his condition."

  "content": "The Countess and Mrs. Farrel were no sooner informed of his case than\nthey hastened to the melancholy scene, where they found Renaldo\ndeprived of his senses, panting under the rage of an exasperated\ndisease. They saw his face distorted, and his eyes glaring with frenzy;\nthey heard him invoke the name of Monimia with a tenderness of accent\nwhich even the impulse of madness could not destroy. Then, with a\nsudden transition of tone and gesture, he denounced vengeance against\nher betrayer, and called upon the north wind to cool the fervour of his\nbrain. His hair hung in dishevelled parcels, his cheeks were wan, his\nlooks ghastly, his vigour was fled, and all the glory of his youth\nfaded; the physician hung his head in silence, the attendants wrung\ntheir hands in despair, and the countenance of his friend was bathed in\ntears.Such a picture would have moved the most obdurate heart; what\nimpression then must it have made upon a parent and sister, melting\nwith all the enthusiasm of affection! The mother was struck dumb, and\nstupefied with grief; the sister threw herself on the bed in a\ntransport of sorrow, caught her loved Renaldo in her arms, and was,\nwith great difficulty, torn from his embrace. Such was the dismal\nreverse that overtook the late so happy family of Melvil; such was the\nextremity to which the treachery of Fathom had reduced his best\nbenefactor!Three days did nature struggle with surprising efforts, and then the\nconstitution seemed to sink under the victorious fever; yet, as his\nstrength diminished, his delirium abated, and on the fifth morning he\nlooked round, and recognised his weeping friends. Though now exhausted\nto the lowest ebb of life, he retained the perfect use of speech, and\nhis reason being quite unclouded, spoke to each with equal kindness and\ncomposure; he congratulated himself upon the sight of shore after the\nhorrors of such a tempest; called upon the Countess and his sister, who\nwere not permitted to see him at such a conjuncture; and being apprised\nby the Major of his reason for excluding them from his presence, he\napplauded his concern, bequeathed them to his future care, and took\nleave of that gentleman with a cordial embrace. Then he desired to be\nleft in private with a certain clergyman, who regulated the concerns of\nhis soul, and he being dismissed, turned his face from the light, in\nexpectation of his final discharge. In a few minutes all was still and\ndreary, he was no longer heard to breathe, no more the stream of life\nwas perceived to circulate, he was supposed to be absolved from all his\ncares, and an universal groan from the bystanders announced the decease\nof the gallant, generous, and tender-hearted Renaldo."

This uncommon sensation he reported\nto the physician, who, though he could feel no pulsation of the heart\nor arteries, conjectured that life still lingered in some of its\ninterior haunts, and immediately ordered such applications to the\nextremities and surface of the body, as might help to concentrate and\nreinforce the natural heat.By these prescriptions, which for some time produced no sensible\neffect, the embers were, in all probability, kept glowing, and the\nvital power revived, for, after a considerable pause, respiration was\ngradually renewed at long intervals, a languid motion was perceived at\nthe heart, a few feeble and irregular pulsations were felt at the\nwrist, the clay-coloured livery of death began to vanish from his face,\nthe circulation acquired new force, and he opened his eyes with a sigh,\nwhich proclaimed his return from the shades of death.When he recovered the faculty of swallowing, a cordial was\nadministered, and whether the fever abated, in consequence of the\nblood’s being cooled and condensed during the recess of action in the\nsolids, or nature, in that agony, had prepared a proper channel for the\nexpulsion of the disease, certain it is, he was from this moment rid of\nall bodily pain; he retrieved the animal functions, and nothing\nremained of his malady but an extreme weakness and languor, the effect\nof nature’s being fatigued in the battle she had won."

  "content": "Unutterable was the joy that took possession of his mother and sister\nwhen Farrel flew into her apartment to intimate this happy turn. Scarce\ncould they be restrained from pouring forth their transports in the\npresence of Renaldo, who was still too feeble to endure such\ncommunication; indeed, he was extremely mortified and dejected at this\nevent, which had diffused such pleasure and satisfaction among his\nfriends, for though his distemper was mastered, the fatal cause of it\nstill rankled at his heart, and he considered this respite from death\nas a protraction of his misery.When he was congratulated by the Major on the triumph of his\nconstitution, he replied, with a groan, “I would to heaven it had been\notherwise, for I am reserved for all the horrors of the most poignant\nsorrow and remorse. O Monimia! Monimia! I hoped by this time to have\nconvinced thy gentle shade, that I was, at least intentionally,\ninnocent of that ruthless barbarity which hath brought thee to an\nuntimely grave. Heaven and earth! do I still survive the consciousness\nof that dire catastrophe! and lives the atrocious villain who hath\nblasted all our hopes!”With these last words the fire darted from his eyes, and his brother,\nsnatching this occasional handle for reconciling him to life, joined in\nhis exclamations against the treacherous Fathom, and observed, that he\nshould not, in point of honour, wish to die, until he should have\nsacrificed that traitor to the manes of the beauteous Monimia. This\nincitement acted as a spur upon exhausted nature, causing the blood to\ncirculate with fresh vigour, and encouraging him to take such\nsustenance as would recruit his strength, and repair the damage which\nhis health had sustained.His sister assiduously attended him in his recovery, flattering his\nappetite, and amusing his sorrow at the same time; the clergyman\nassailed his despondence with religious weapons, as well as with\narguments drawn from philosophy; and the fury of his passions being\nalready expended, he became so tractable as to listen to his\nremonstrances. But notwithstanding the joint endeavours of all his\nfriends, a deep fixed melancholy remained after every consequence of\nhis disease had vanished. In vain they essayed to elude his grief by\ngaiety and diversions, in vain they tried to decoy his heart into some\nnew engagement."

  "content": "These kind attempts served only to feed and nourish that melancholy\nwhich pined within his bosom. Monimia still haunted him in the midst of\nthese amusements, while his reflection whispered to him, “Pleasures\nlike these I might have relished with her participation.” That darling\nidea mingled in all the female assemblies at which he was present,\neclipsing their attractions, and enhancing the bitterness of his loss;\nfor absence, enthusiasm, and even his despair had heightened the charms\nof the fair orphan into something supernatural and divine.Time, that commonly weakens the traces of remembrance, seemed to deepen\nits impressions in his breast; nightly, in his dreams, did he converse\nwith his dear Monimia, sometimes on the verdant bank of a delightful\nstream, where he breathed, in soft murmurs, the dictates of his love\nand admiration; sometimes reclined within the tufted grove, his arm\nencircled and sustained her snowy neck, whilst she, with looks of love\nineffable, gazed on his face, invoking Heaven to bless her husband and\nher lord. Yet, even in these illusions was his fancy oft alarmed for\nthe ill-fated fair. Sometimes he viewed her tottering on the brink of a\nsteep precipice, far distant from his helping hand; at other times she\nseemed to sail along the boisterous tide, imploring his assistance,\nthen would he start with horror from his sleep, and feel his sorrows\nmore than realised; he deserted his couch, he avoided the society of\nmankind, he courted sequestered shades where he could indulge his\nmelancholy; there his mind brooded over his calamity until his\nimagination became familiar with all the ravages of death; it\ncontemplated the gradual decline of Monimia’s health, her tears, her\ndistress, her despair at his imagined cruelty; he saw, through that\nperspective, every blossom of her beauty wither, every sparkle vanish\nfrom her eyes; he beheld her faded lips, her pale cheek, and her\ninanimated features, the symmetry of which not death itself was able to\ndestroy. His fancy conveyed her breathless corse to the cold grave,\no’er which, perhaps, no tear humane was shed, where her delicate limbs\nwere consigned to dust, where she was dished out a delicious banquet to\nthe unsparing worm."

  "content": "Over these pictures he dwelt with a sort of pleasing anguish, until he\nbecame so enamoured of her tomb, that he could no longer resist the\ndesire that compelled him to make a pilgrimage to the dear hallowed\nspot, where all his once gay hopes lay buried; that he might nightly\nvisit the silent habitation of his ruined love, embrace the sacred\nearth with which she was now compounded, moisten it with his tears, and\nbid the turf lie easy on her breast. Besides the prospect of this\ngloomy enjoyment, he was urged to return to England, by an eager desire\nof taking vengeance on the perfidious Fathom, as well as of acquitting\nhimself of the obligations he owed in that kingdom, to those who had\nassisted him in his distress. He therefore communicated his intention\nto Farrel, who would have insisted upon attending him in the journey,\nhad not he been conjured to stay and manage Renaldo’s affairs in his\nabsence. Every previous step being taken, he took leave of the Countess\nand his sister, who had, with all their interest and elocution, opposed\nhis design, the execution of which, they justly feared, would, instead\nof dissipating, augment his chagrin; and now, seeing him determined,\nthey shed a flood of tears at his departure, and he set out from Vienna\nin a post-chaise, accompanied by a trusty valet-de-chambre on\nhorseback.CHAPTER SIXTY-ONERENALDO MEETS WITH A LIVING MONUMENT OF JUSTICE, AND ENCOUNTERS A\nPERSONAGE OF SOME NOTE IN THESE MEMOIRS.As this domestic was very well qualified for making all the proper\ndispositions, and adjusting every necessary article on the road,\nRenaldo totally abstracted himself from earthly considerations, and\nmused without ceasing on that theme which was the constant subject of\nhis contemplation. He was blind to the objects that surrounded him; he\nscarce ever felt the importunities of nature; and had not they been\nreinforced by the pressing entreaties of his attendant, he would have\nproceeded without refreshment or repose. In this absence of mind did he\ntraverse a great part of Germany, in his way to the Austrian\nNetherlands, and arrived at the fortress of Luxemburg, where he was\nobliged to tarry a whole day on account of an accident which had\nhappened to his chaise. Here he went to view the fortifications; and as\nhe walked along the ramparts, his ears were saluted with these words:\n“Heaven bless the noble Count de Melvil! will not he turn the eyes of\ncompassion on an old fellow-soldier reduced to misfortune and\ndisgrace?”Surprised at this address, which was attended with the clanking of\nchains, Renaldo lifted up his eyes, and perceived the person who spoke\nto be one of two malefactors shackled together, who had been sentenced\nfor some crime to work as labourers on the fortifications. His face was\nso covered with hair, and his whole appearance so disguised by the\nsqualid habit which he wore, that the Count could not recollect his\nfeatures, until he gave him to understand that his name was Ratchcali.\nMelvil immediately recognised his fellow-student at Vienna, and his\nbrother-volunteer upon the Rhine, and expressed equal surprise and\nconcern at seeing him in such a deplorable situation."

Without betraying the least symptoms of\nshame or confusion, “Count,” says he, “this is the fate of war, at\nleast of the war in which I have been engaged, ever since I took leave\nof the Imperial army, and retreated with your old companion Fathom.\nLong life to that original genius! If he is not unhappily eclipsed by\nsome unfortunate interposition, before his terrene parts are purified,\nI foresee that he will shine a star of the first magnitude in the world\nof adventure.”At mention of this detested name, Renaldo’s heart began to throb with\nindignation; yet he suppressed the emotion, and desired to know the\nmeaning of that splendid encomium which he had bestowed upon his\nconfederate. “It would be quite unnecessary,” replied Ratchcali, “for a\nman in my present situation to equivocate or disguise the truth. The\nnature of my disgrace is perfectly well known. I am condemned to hard\nlabour for life; and unless some lucky accident, which I cannot now\nforesee, shall intervene, all I can expect is some alleviation of my\nhard lot from the generosity of such gentlemen as you, who\ncompassionate the sufferings of your fellow-creatures. In order to\nengage your benevolence the more in my behalf, I shall, if you will\ngive me the hearing, faithfully inform you of some particulars, which\nit may import you to know, concerning my old acquaintance Ferdinand\nCount Fathom, whose real character hath perhaps hitherto escaped your\nnotice.”Then he proceeded to give a regular detail of all the strokes of\nfinesse which he, in conjunction with our adventurer, had practised\nupon Melvil and others, during their residence at Vienna, and the\ncampaigns they had made upon the Rhine. He explained the nature of the\nrobbery which was supposed to have been done by the Count’s valet,\ntogether with the manner of their desertion. He described his\nseparation from Fathom, their meeting at London, the traffic they\ncarried on in copartnership; and the misfortune that reduced Ferdinand\nto the condition in which he was found by Melvil."

But, chancing to meet with an old acquaintance,\nwhom I did not at all desire to see, I found it convenient to withdraw\nsoftly to Rotterdam; from whence we set out for Antwerp; and, having\nmade a tour of the Austrian Netherlands, set up our rest at Brussels,\nand concerted a plan for laying the Flemings under contribution.“From our appearance we procured admission into the most polite\nassemblies, and succeeded to a wonder in all our operations; until our\ncareer was unfortunately checked by the indiscretion of my ally, who,\nbeing detected in the very act of conveying a card, was immediately\nintroduced to a magistrate. And this minister of justice was so\ncurious, inquisitive, and clear-sighted, that Count Maurice, finding it\nimpossible to elude his penetration, was fain to stipulate for his own\nsafety, by giving up his friend to the cognisance of the law. I was\naccordingly apprehended, before I knew the cause of my arrest; and\nbeing unhappily known by some soldiers of the Prince’s guard, my\ncharacter turned out so little to the approbation of the inquisitors,\nthat all my effects were confiscated for the benefit of the state, and\nI was by a formal sentence condemned to labour on the fortifications\nall the days of my life; while Maurice escaped at the expense of five\nhundred stripes, which he received in public from the hands of the\ncommon executioner.“Thus have I, without evasion or mental reservation, given a faithful\naccount of the steps by which I have arrived at this barrier, which is\nlikely to be the ne plus ultra of my peregrinations, unless the\ngenerous Count de Melvil will deign to interpose his interest in behalf\nof an old fellow-soldier, who may yet live to justify his mediation.”"

  "content": "Renaldo had no reason to doubt the truth of this story, every\ncircumstance of which tended to corroborate the intelligence he had\nalready received touching the character of Fathom, whom he now\nconsidered with a double portion of abhorrence, as the most abandoned\nmiscreant that nature had ever produced. Though Ratchcali did not\npossess a much higher place in his opinion, he favoured him with marks\nof his bounty, and exhorted him, if possible, to reform his heart; but\nhe would by no means promise to interpose his credit in favour of a\nwretch self-convicted of such enormous villany and fraud. He could not\nhelp moralising upon this rencontre, which inspired him with great\ncontempt for human nature. And next day he proceeded on his journey\nwith a heavy heart, ruminating on the perfidy of mankind, and, between\nwhiles, transported with the prospect of revenging all his calamities\nupon the accursed author.While he was wrapped up in these reveries, his carriage rolled along,\nand had already entered a wood between Mons and Tournay, when his dream\nwas suddenly interrupted by the explosion of several pistols that were\nfired among the thickets at a little distance from the road. Roused at\nthis alarm, he snatched his sword that stood by him, and springing from\nthe chaise, ran directly towards the spot, being close followed by his\nvalet, who had alighted and armed himself with a pistol in each hand.\nAbout forty yards from the highway, they arrived in a little glade or\nopening, where they saw a single man standing at bay against five\nbanditti, after having killed one of their companions, and lost his own\nhorse, that lay dead upon the ground.Melvil seeing this odds, and immediately guessing their design, rushed\namong them without hesitation, and in an instant ran his sword through\nthe heart of one whose hand was raised to smite the gentleman behind,\nwhile he was engaged with the rest in front. At the same time the valet\ndisabled another by a shot in the shoulder; so that the number being\nnow equal on both sides, a furious combat ensued, every man being\npaired with an antagonist, and each having recourse to swords, as all\ntheir pieces had been discharged. Renaldo’s adversary, finding himself\npressed with equal fury and skill, retreated gradually among the trees,\nuntil he vanished altogether into the thickest of the wood; and his two\ncompanions followed his example with great ease, the valet-de-chambre\nbeing hurt in the leg, and the stranger so much exhausted by the wounds\nhe had received before Renaldo’s interposition, that, when the young\ngentleman approached to congratulate him on the defeat of the robbers,\nhe, in advancing to embrace his deliverer, dropped down motionless on\nthe grass."

However, before they reappeared, Renaldo’s driver\ndisengaged him from the wood, and in less than a quarter of an hour\nthey arrived at a village, where they halted for assistance to the\nstranger, who, though still alive, had not recovered the use of his\nsenses.After he was undressed, and laid in a warm bed, a surgeon examined his\nbody, and found a wound in his neck by a sword, and another in his\nright side, occasioned by a pistol-shot; so that his prognostic was\nvery dubious. Meanwhile, he applied proper dressings to both; and, in\nhalf an hour after this administration, the gentleman gave some tokens\nof perception. He looked around him with a wildness of fury in his\naspect, as if he had thought himself in the hands of the robbers by\nwhom he had been attacked. But, when he saw the assiduity with which\nthe bystanders exerted themselves in his behalf, one raising his head\nfrom the pillow, while another exhorted him to swallow a little wine\nwhich was warmed for the purpose; when he beheld the sympathising looks\nof all present, and heard himself accosted in the most cordial terms by\nthe person whom he recollected as his deliverer, all the severity\nvanished from his countenance; he took Renaldo’s hand, and pressed it\nto his lips; and, while the tears gushed from his eyes, “Praised be\nGod,” said he, “that virtue and generosity are still to be found among\nthe sons of men.”Everybody in the apartment was affected by this exclamation; and\nMelvil, above all the rest, felt such emotions as he could scarcely\nrestrain. He entreated the gentleman to believe himself in the midst of\nsuch friends as would effectually secure him from all violence and\nmortification; he conjured him to compose the perturbation of his\nspirits, and quiet the apprehensions of his mind with that reflection;\nand protested, that he himself would not quit the house while his\nattendance should be deemed necessary for the stranger’s cure, or his\nconversation conducive to his amusement."

Then was\nRenaldo indulged with opportunities of conversing with the patient, and\nof inquiring into the particulars of his fortune and designs in life,\nwith a view to manifest the inclination he felt to serve him in his\nfuture occasions.The more this stranger contemplated the character of the Count, the\nmore his amazement increased, on account of his extraordinary\nbenevolence in favour of a person whose merit he could not possibly\nknow; he even expressed his surprise on this subject to Renaldo, who at\nlength told him, that, although his best offices should always be ready\nfor the occasions of any gentleman in distress, his particular\nattachment and regard to him was improved by an additional\nconsideration. “I am no stranger,” said he, “to the virtues and honour\nof the gallant Don Diego de Zelos.”“Heaven and earth!” cried the stranger, starting from his seat with\nextreme emotion, “do I then live to hear myself addressed by that\nlong-lost appellation! my heart glows at the expression! my spirits are\nkindled with a flame that thrills through every nerve! Say, young\ngentleman, if you are really an inhabitant of earth, by what means are\nyou acquainted with the unhappy name of Zelos?”In answer to this eager interrogation, Renaldo gave him to understand,\nthat in the course of his travels, he had resided a short time at\nSeville, where he had frequently seen Don Diego, and often heard his\ncharacter mentioned with uncommon esteem and veneration. “Alas!”\nreplied the Castilian, “that justice is no longer done to the wretched\nZelos; his honours are blasted, and his reputation canker-bitten by the\nvenomous tooth of slander.”"

When he repeated the\nstory of that cruel fraud which was practised upon him by the faithless\nFadini, Melvil, whose mind and imagination teemed with the villanies of\nFathom, was immediately struck with the conjecture of his being the\nknave; because, indeed, he could not believe that any other person was\nso abandoned by principle and humanity as to take such a barbarous\nadvantage of a gentleman in distress.CHAPTER SIXTY-TWOHIS RETURN TO ENGLAND, AND MIDNIGHT PILGRIMAGE TO MONIMIA’S TOMB.He considered the date of that unparalleled transaction, which agreed\nwith his conjecture, and from the inquiries he made concerning the\nperson of the traitor, gathered reasons sufficient to confirm his\nsupposition.

O Don Diego! what is life, when all its\nenjoyments are so easily poisoned by the machinations of such a worm!”\nSo saying, he smote his breast in all the agony of woe, and besought\nthe Spaniard to relate the steps he took in consequence of this\ndisaster.The Castilian’s cheeks reddened at this information, which enforced his\nown resentment, and casting up his eyes to heaven, “Sacred powers!”\ncried he, “let him not perish, before you bring him within my reach.\nYou ask me, noble cavalier, what measures I took in this abyss of\nmisery? For the first day, I was tortured with apprehensions for the\nfriendly Fadini, fearing that he had been robbed and murdered for the\njewels which he had, perhaps, too unwarily exposed to sale. But this\nterror soon vanished before the true presages of my fate, when, on the\nmorrow, I found the whole family in tears and confusion, and heard my\nlandlord pour forth the most bitter imprecations against the fugitive,\nwho had deflowered his daughter, and even robbed the house. You will\nask, which of the passions of my heart were interested on this\noccasion? they were shame and indignation. All my grief flowed in\nanother channel; I blushed to find my judgment deceived; I scorned to\ncomplain; but, in my heart, denounced vengeance against my base\nbetrayer. I silently retired to my apartment, in order to commune with\nmy own thoughts."

Thus determined, I betook myself to the house of a\ngeneral officer, whose character was fair in the world; and having\nobtained admission in consequence of my Oriental appearance, ‘To a man\nof honour,’ said I, ‘the unfortunate need no introduction. My habit\nproclaims me a Persian; this passport from the States of Holland will\nconfirm that supposition. I have been robbed of jewels to a\nconsiderable value, by a wretch whom I favoured with my confidence; and\nnow, reduced to extreme indigence, I come to offer myself as a soldier\nin the armies of France. I have health and strength sufficient to\ndischarge that duty. Nor am I unacquainted with a military life, which\nwas once my glory and occupation. I therefore sue for your protection,\nthat I may be received, though in the lowest order of them that serve\nthe King; and that your future favour may depend upon my behaviour in\nthat capacity.’“The general, surprised at my declaration, surveyed me with uncommon\nattention; he perused my certificate; asked divers questions concerning\nthe art of war, to which I returned such answers as convinced him that\nI was not wholly ignorant in that particular. In short, I was enlisted\nas a volunteer in his own regiment, and soon after promoted to the rank\nof a subaltern, and the office of equerry to his own son, who, at that\ntime, had attained to the degree of colonel, though his age did not\nexceed eighteen years.“This young man was naturally of a ferocious disposition, which had\nbeen rendered quite untractable by the pride of birth and fortune,\ntogether with the licence of his education. As he did not know the\nrespect due to a gentleman, so he could not possibly pay it to those\nwho were, unfortunately, under his command. Divers mortifications I\nsustained with that fortitude which became a Castilian who lay under\nobligations to the father; till, at length, laying aside all decorum,\nhe smote me. Sacred Heaven! he smote Don Diego de Zelos, in presence of\nhis whole household.“Had my sword been endowed with sensation, it would of itself have\nstarted from its scabbard at this indignity offered to its master. I\nunsheathed it without deliberation, saying, ‘Know, insolent boy, he is\na gentleman whom thou hast outraged; and thou hast thus cancelled the\nties which have hitherto restrained my indignation.’ His servants would\nhave interposed, but he commanded them to retire; and, flushed with\nthat confidence which the impetuosity of his temper inspired, he drew,\nin his turn, and attacked me with redoubled rage; but his dexterity\nbeing very unequal to his courage, he was soon disarmed, and\noverthrown; when, pointing my sword to his breast, ‘In consideration of\nthy youth and ignorance,’ said I, ‘I spare that life which thou hast\nforfeited by thy ungenerous presumption.’"

This\nwas the consideration that incessantly prompted, and still importunes\nme to run every risk of life and fortune, rather than leave my fame\nunder such an ignominious aspersion. I purpose to obey this internal\ncall. I am apt to believe it is the voice of Heaven—of that Providence\nwhich manifested its care by sending such a generous auxiliary to my\naid, when I was overpowered by banditti, on the very first day of my\nexpedition.”Having in this manner gratified the curiosity of his deliverer, he\nexpressed a desire of knowing the quality of him to whom he was so\nsignally obliged; and Renaldo did not scruple to make the Castilian\nacquainted with his name and family. He likewise communicated the story\nof his unfortunate love, with all the symptoms of unutterable woe,\nwhich drew tears from the noble-hearted Spaniard, while, with a groan,\nthat announced the load which overwhelmed his soul, “I had a daughter,”\nsaid he, “such as you describe the peerless Monimia; had Heaven decreed\nher for the arms of such a lover, I, who am now the most wretched,\nshould have been the most happy parent upon earth.”"

  "content": "Thus did these new friends alternately indulge their mutual sorrow, and\nconcert measures for their future operations. Melvil earnestly\nsolicited the Castilian to favour him with his company to England,\nwhere, in all probability, both would enjoy the gloomy satisfaction of\nbeing revenged upon their common betrayer, Fathom; and, as a farther\ninducement, he assured him, that, as soon as he should have\naccomplished the melancholy purposes of his voyage, he would accompany\nDon Diego to Spain, and employ his whole interest and fortune in his\nservice. The Spaniard, thunderstruck at the extravagant generosity of\nthis proposal, could scarce believe the evidence of his own senses;\nand, after some pause, replied, “My duty would teach me to obey any\ncommand you should think proper to impose; but here my inclination and\ninterest are so agreeably flattered, that I should be equally\nungrateful and unwise, in pretending to comply with reluctance.”This point being settled, they moved forwards to Mons, as soon as Don\nDiego was in a condition to bear the shock of such a removal, and there\nremaining until his wounds were perfectly cured, they hired a\npost-chaise for Ostend, embarked in a vessel at that port, reached the\nopposite shore of England, after a short and easy passage, and arrived\nin London without having met with any sinister accident on the road.As they approached this capital, Renaldo’s grief seemed to regurgitate\nwith redoubled violence. His memory was waked to the most minute and\npainful exertion of its faculties; his imagination teemed with the most\nafflicting images, and his impatience became so ardent, that never\nlover panted more eagerly for the consummation of his wishes, than\nMelvil, for an opportunity of stretching himself upon the grave of the\nlost Monimia. The Castilian was astonished, as well as affected, at the\npoignancy of his grief, which, as a proof of his susceptibility and\nvirtue, endeared him still more to his affection; and though his own\nmisfortunes had rendered him very unfit for the office of a comforter,\nhe endeavoured, by soothing discourse, to moderate the excess of his\nfriend’s affliction.Though it was dark when they alighted at the inn, Melvil ordered a\ncoach to be called; and, being attended by the Spaniard, who would not\nbe persuaded to quit him upon such an occasion, he repaired to the\nhouse of the generous Jew, whose rheum distilled very plentifully at\nhis approach. The Count had already acquitted himself in point of\npecuniary obligations to this benevolent Hebrew; and now, after having\nmade such acknowledgments as might be expected from a youth of his\ndisposition, he begged to know by what channel he had received that\nletter which he had been so kind as to forward to Vienna."

By that letter, which you committed to the\ncharge of my worthy friend Joshua, the fatal veil was removed from my\neyes, which had been so long darkened by the artifices of incredible\ndeceit, and my own incurable misery fully presented to my view. If you\nwere acquainted with the unhappy fair, who hath fallen a victim to my\nmistake, you will have some idea of the insufferable pangs which I now\nfeel in recollecting her fate. If you have compassion for these pangs,\nyou will not refuse to conduct me to the spot where the dear remains of\nMonimia are deposited; there let me enjoy a full banquet of woe; there\nlet me feast that worm of sorrow that preys upon my heart. For such\nentertainment have I revisited this (to me) ill-omened isle; for this\nsatisfaction I intrude upon your condescension at these unseasonable\nhours; for to such a degree of impatience is my affliction whetted,\nthat no slumber shall assail mine eyelids, no peace reside within my\nbosom, until I shall have adored that earthly shrine where my Monimia\nlies! Yet would I know the circumstances of her fate. Did Heaven ordain\nno angel to minister to her distress? were her last moments\ncomfortless? ha! was not she abandoned to indigence, to insults; left\nin the power of that inhuman villain who betrayed us both? Sacred\nHeaven! why did Providence wink at the triumph of such consummate\nperfidy?”"

I am a judge of your feelings, because I know the value of\nyour loss. I attended the incomparable Monimia in her last illness, and\nam well enough acquainted with her story to conclude that she fell a\nsacrifice to an unhappy misunderstanding, effected and fomented by that\ntraitor who abused your mutual confidence.”He then proceeded to inform him of all the particulars which we have\nalready recorded, touching the destiny of the beauteous orphan, and\nconcluded with telling him he was ready to yield him any other\nsatisfaction which it was in his power to grant. The circumstances of\nthe tale had put Renaldo’s spirits into such commotion, that he could\nutter nothing but interjections and unconnected words. When Fathom’s\nbehaviour was described, he trembled with fierce agitation, started\nfrom his chair, pronouncing, “Monster! fiend! but we shall one day\nmeet.”When he was made acquainted with the benevolence of the French lady, he\nexclaimed, “O heaven-born charity and compassion! sure that must be\nsome spirit of grace sent hither to mitigate the tortures of life!\nwhere shall I find her, to offer up my thanks and adoration?” Having\nheard the conclusion of the detail, he embraced the relater, as the\nkind benefactor of Monimia, shed a flood of tears in his bosom, and\npressed him to crown the obligation, by conducting him to the solitary\nplace where now she rested from all her cares.The gentleman perceiving the transports of his grief were such as could\nnot be opposed, complied with his request, attended him in the vehicle,\nand directed the coachman to drive to a sequestered field, at some\ndistance from the city, where stood the church, within whose awful\naisle this scene was to be acted. The sexton being summoned from his\nbed, produced the keys, in consequence of a gratification, after the\nphysician had communed with him apart, and explained the intention of\nRenaldo’s visit."

The uncommon darkness of the night, the solemn\nsilence, and lonely situation of the place, conspired with the occasion\nof his coming, and the dismal images of his fancy, to produce a real\nrapture of gloomy expectation, which the whole world would not have\npersuaded him to disappoint. The clock struck twelve, the owl screeched\nfrom the ruined battlement, the door was opened by the sexton, who, by\nthe light of a glimmering taper, conducted the despairing lover to a\ndreary aisle, and stamped upon the ground with his foot, saying, “Here\nthe young lady lies interred.”Melvil no sooner received this intimation, than falling on his knees,\nand pressing his lips to the hallowed earth, “Peace,” cried he, “to the\ngentle tenant of this silent habitation.” Then turning to the\nbystanders, with a bloodshot eye, said, “Leave me to the full enjoyment\nof this occasion; my grief is too delicate to admit the company even of\nmy friends. The rites to be performed require privacy; adieu, then,\nhere must I pass the night alone.”The doctor, alarmed at this declaration, which he was afraid imported\nsome resolution fatal to his own life, began to repent of having been\naccessory to the visit, attempted to dissuade him from his purpose, and\nfinding him obstinately determined, called in the assistance of the\nsexton and coachman, and solicited the aid of Don Diego, to force\nRenaldo from the execution of his design.The Castilian knowing his friend was then very unfit for common\naltercation, interposed in the dispute, saying, “You need not be afraid\nthat he will obey the dictates of despair; his religion, his honour\nwill baffle such temptations; he hath promised to reserve his life for\nthe occasions of his friend; and he shall not be disappointed in his\npresent aim.” In order to corroborate this peremptory address, which\nwas delivered in the French language, he unsheathed his sword, and the\nothers retreating at sight of his weapon, “Count,” said he, “enjoy your\ngrief in full transport; I will screen you from interruption, though at\nthe hazard of my life; and while you give a loose to sorrow, within the\nghastly vault, I will watch till morning in the porch, and meditate\nupon the ruin of my own family and peace.”He accordingly prevailed upon the physician to retire, after he had\nsatisfied the sexton, and ordered the coachman to return by break of\nday."

Is this the fruit of those\nendearing hopes, that intercourse divine, that raptured admiration, in\nwhich so many hours insensibly elapsed? where now are those attractions\nto which I yielded up my captive heart? quenched are those genial eyes\nthat gladdened each beholder, and shone the planets of my happiness and\npeace! cold! cold and withered are those lips that swelled with love,\nand far outblushed the damask rose! and ah! forever silenced is that\ntongue, whose eloquence had power to lull the pangs of misery and care!\nno more shall my attention be ravished with the music of that voice,\nwhich used to thrill in soft vibrations to my soul!
