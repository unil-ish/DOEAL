  "content": "The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom, Smollett’s third novel, was\ngiven to the world in 1753. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, writing to her\ndaughter, the Countess of Bute, over a year later [January 1st, 1755],\nremarked that “my friend Smollett . . . has certainly a talent for\ninvention, though I think it flags a little in his last work.” Lady\nMary was both right and wrong. The inventive power which we commonly\nthink of as Smollett’s was the ability to work over his own experience\ninto realistic fiction. Of this, Ferdinand Count Fathom shows\ncomparatively little. It shows relatively little, too, of Smollett’s\nvigorous personality, which in his earlier works was present to give\nlife and interest to almost every chapter, were it to describe a street\nbrawl, a ludicrous situation, a whimsical character, or with venomous\nprejudice to gibbet some enemy. This individuality—the peculiar spirit\nof the author which can be felt rather than described—is present in the\ndedication of Fathom to Doctor ———, who is no other than Smollett\nhimself, and a candid revelation of his character, by the way, this\ndedication contains. It is present, too, in the opening chapters, which\nshow, likewise, in the picture of Fathom’s mother, something of the\nauthor’s peculiar “talent for invention.” Subsequently, however, there\nis no denying that the Smollett invention and the Smollett spirit both\nflag. And yet, in a way, Fathom displays more invention than any of the\nauthor’s novels; it is based far less than any other on personal\nexperience. Unfortunately such thorough-going invention was not suited\nto Smollett’s genius. The result is, that while uninteresting as a\nnovel of contemporary manners, Fathom has an interest of its own in\nthat it reveals a new side of its author. We think of Smollett,\ngenerally, as a rambling storyteller, a rational, unromantic man of the\nworld, who fills his pages with his own oddly-metamorphosed\nacquaintances and experiences. The Smollett of Count Fathom, on the\ncontrary, is rather a forerunner of the romantic school, who has\ncreated a tolerably organic tale of adventure out of his own brain.\nThough this is notably less readable than the author’s earlier works,\nstill the wonder is that when the man is so far “off his beat,” he\nshould yet know so well how to meet the strange conditions which\nconfront him. To one whose idea of Smollett’s genius is formed entirely\nby Random and Pickle and Humphry Clinker, Ferdinand Count Fathom will\noffer many surprises."

  "content": "The first of these is the comparative lifelessness of the book. True,\nhere again are action and incident galore, but generally unaccompanied\nby that rough Georgian hurly-burly, common in Smollett, which is so\ninteresting to contemplate from a comfortable distance, and which goes\nso far towards making his fiction seem real. Nor are the characters,\nfor the most part, life-like enough to be interesting. There is an\napparent exception, to be sure, in the hero’s mother, already\nmentioned, the hardened camp-follower, whom we confidently expect to\nbecome vitalised after the savage fashion of Smollett’s characters.\nBut, alas! we have no chance to learn the lady’s style of conversation,\nfor the few words that come from her lips are but partially\ncharacteristic; we have only too little chance to learn her manners and\ncustoms. In the fourth chapter, while she is making sure with her\ndagger that all those on the field of battle whom she wishes to rifle\nare really dead, an officer of the hussars, who has been watching her\nlucrative progress, unfeelingly puts a brace of bullets into the lady’s\nbrain, just as she raises her hand to smite him to the heart. Perhaps\nit is as well that she is thus removed before our disappointment at the\nnon-fulfilment of her promise becomes poignant. So far as we may judge\nfrom the other personages of Count Fathom, even this interesting Amazon\nwould sooner or later have turned into a wooden figure, with a label\ngiving the necessary information as to her character."

  "content": "Such certainly is her son, Fathom, the hero of the book. Because he is\nplacarded, “Shrewd villain of monstrous inhumanity,” we are fain to\naccept him for what his creator intended; but seldom in word or deed is\nhe a convincingly real villain. His friend and foil, the noble young\nCount de Melvil, is no more alive than he; and equally wooden are\nJoshua, the high-minded, saint-like Jew, and that tedious, foolish Don\nDiego. Neither is the heroine alive, the peerless Monimia, but then, in\nher case, want of vitality is not surprising; the presence of it would\namaze us. If she were a woman throbbing with life, she would be\ndifferent from Smollett’s other heroines. The “second lady” of the\nmelodrama, Mademoiselle de Melvil, though by no means vivified, is yet\nmore real than her sister-in-law.The fact that they are mostly inanimate figures is not the only\nsurprise given us by the personages of Count Fathom. It is a surprise\nto find few of them strikingly whimsical; it is a surprise to find them\nin some cases far more distinctly conceived than any of the people in\nRoderick Random or Peregrine Pickle. In the second of these, we saw\nSmollett beginning to understand the use of incident to indicate\nconsistent development of character. In Count Fathom, he seems fully to\nunderstand this principle of art, though he has not learned to apply it\nsuccessfully. And so, in spite of an excellent conception, Fathom, as I\nhave said, is unreal. After all his villainies, which he perpetrates\nwithout any apparent qualms of conscience, it is incredible that he\nshould honestly repent of his crimes. We are much inclined to doubt\nwhen we read that “his vice and ambition was now quite mortified within\nhim,” the subsequent testimony of Matthew Bramble, Esq., in Humphry\nClinker, to the contrary, notwithstanding. Yet Fathom up to this point\nis consistently drawn, and drawn for a purpose:—to show that\ncold-blooded roguery, though successful for a while, will come to grief\nin the end. To heighten the effect of his scoundrel, Smollett develops\nparallel with him the virtuous Count de Melvil. The author’s scheme of\nthus using one character as the foil of another, though not conspicuous\nfor its originality, shows a decided advance in the theory of\nconstructive technique. Only, as I have said, Smollett’s execution is\nnow defective."

  "content": "“But,” one will naturally ask, “if Fathom lacks the amusing, and not\ninfrequently stimulating, hurly-burly of Smollett’s former novels; if\nits characters, though well-conceived, are seldom divertingly fantastic\nand never thoroughly animate; what makes the book interesting?” The\nsurprise will be greater than ever when the answer is given that, to a\nlarge extent, the plot makes Fathom interesting. Yes, Smollett,\nhitherto indifferent to structure, has here written a story in which\nthe plot itself, often clumsy though it may be, engages a reader’s\nattention. One actually wants to know whether the young Count is ever\ngoing to receive consolation for his sorrows and inflict justice on his\nbasely ungrateful pensioner. And when, finally, all turns out as it\nshould, one is amazed to find how many of the people in the book have\nhelped towards the designed conclusion. Not all of them, indeed, nor\nall of the adventures, are indispensable, but it is manifest at the end\nthat much, which, for the time, most readers think irrelevant—such as\nDon Diego’s history—is, after all, essential.It has already been said that in Count Fathom Smollett appears to some\nextent as a romanticist, and this is another fact which lends interest\nto the book. That he had a powerful imagination is not a surprise. Any\none versed in Smollett has already seen it in the remarkable situations\nwhich he has put before us in his earlier works. These do not indicate,\nhowever, that Smollett possessed the imagination which could excite\nromantic interest; for in Roderick Random and in Peregrine Pickle, the\nwonderful situations serve chiefly to amuse. In Fathom, however, there\nare some designed to excite horror; and one, at least, is eminently\nsuccessful. The hero’s night in the wood between Bar-le-duc and Chalons\nwas no doubt more blood-curdling to our eighteenth-century ancestors\nthan it is to us, who have become acquainted with scores of similar\nsituations in the small number of exciting romances which belong to\nliterature, and in the greater number which do not. Still, even to-day,\na reader, with his taste jaded by trashy novels, will be conscious of\nSmollett’s power, and of several thrills, likewise, as he reads about\nFathom’s experience in the loft in which the beldame locks him to pass\nthe night."

  "content": "This situation is melodramatic rather than romantic, as the word is\nused technically in application to eighteenth and nineteenth-century\nliterature. There is no little in Fathom, however, which is genuinely\nromantic in the latter sense. Such is the imprisonment of the Countess\nin the castle-tower, whence she waves her handkerchief to the young\nCount, her son and would-be rescuer. And especially so is the scene in\nthe church, when Renaldo (the very name is romantic) visits at midnight\nthe supposed grave of his lady-love. While he was waiting for the\nsexton to open the door, his “soul . . . was wound up to the highest\npitch of enthusiastic sorrow. The uncommon darkness, . . . the solemn\nsilence, and lonely situation of the place, conspired with the occasion\nof his coming, and the dismal images of his fancy, to produce a real\nrapture of gloomy expectation, which the whole world could not have\npersuaded him to disappoint. The clock struck twelve, the owl screeched\nfrom the ruined battlement, the door was opened by the sexton, who, by\nthe light of a glimmering taper, conducted the despairing lover to a\ndreary aisle, and stamped upon the ground with his foot, saying, ‘Here\nthe young lady lies interred.’”We have here such an amount of the usual romantic machinery of the\n“grave-yard” school of poets—that school of which Professor W. L.\nPhelps calls Young, in his Night Thoughts, the most “conspicuous\nexemplar”—that one is at first inclined to think Smollett poking fun at\nit. The context, however, seems to prove that he was perfectly serious.\nIt is interesting, then, as well as surprising, to find traces of the\nromantic spirit in his fiction over ten years before Walpole’s Castle\nof Otranto. It is also interesting to find so much melodramatic feeling\nin him, because it makes stronger the connection between him and his\nnineteenth-century disciple, Dickens."

  "content": "From all that I have said, it must not be thought that the usual\nSmollett is always, or almost always, absent from Count Fathom. I have\nspoken of the dedication and of the opening chapters as what we might\nexpect from his pen. There are, besides, true Smollett strokes in the\nscenes in the prison from which Melvil rescues Fathom, and there is a\ngood deal of the satirical Smollett fun in the description of Fathom’s\nups and downs, first as the petted beau, and then as the fashionable\ndoctor. In chronicling the latter meteoric career, Smollett had already\nobserved the peculiarity of his countrymen which Thackeray was fond of\nharping on in the next century—“the maxim which universally prevails\namong the English people . . . to overlook, . . . on their return to\nthe metropolis, all the connexions they may have chanced to acquire\nduring their residence at any of the medical wells. And this social\ndisposition is so scrupulously maintained, that two persons who live in\nthe most intimate correspondence at Bath or Tunbridge, shall, in\nfour-and-twenty hours . . . meet in St. James’s Park, without betraying\nthe least token of recognition.” And good, too, is the way in which, as\nDr. Fathom goes rapidly down the social hill, he makes excuses for his\ndeclining splendour. His chariot was overturned “with a hideous crash”\nat such danger to himself, “that he did not believe he should ever\nhazard himself again in any sort of wheel carriage.” He turned off his\nmen for maids, because “men servants are generally impudent, lazy,\ndebauched, or dishonest.” To avoid the din of the street, he shifted\nhis lodgings into a quiet, obscure court. And so forth and so on, in\nthe true Smollett vein.But, after all, such of the old sparks are struck only occasionally.\nApart from its plot, which not a few nineteenth-century writers of\ndetective-stories might have improved, The Adventures of Ferdinand\nCount Fathom is less interesting for itself than any other piece of\nfiction from Smollett’s pen. For a student of Smollett, however, it is\nhighly interesting as showing the author’s romantic, melodramatic\ntendencies, and the growth of his constructive technique.G. H. MAYNADIERTHE ADVENTURES OF FERDINAND COUNT FATHOMTO DOCTOR ———You and I, my good friend, have often deliberated on the difficulty of\nwriting such a dedication as might gratify the self-complacency of a\npatron, without exposing the author to the ridicule or censure of the\npublic; and I think we generally agreed that the task was altogether\nimpracticable.—Indeed, this was one of the few subjects on which we\nhave always thought in the same manner. For, notwithstanding that\ndeference and regard which we mutually pay to each other, certain it\nis, we have often differed, according to the predominancy of those\ndifferent passions, which frequently warp the opinion, and perplex the\nunderstanding of the most judicious.In dedication, as in poetry, there is no medium; for, if any one of the\nhuman virtues be omitted in the enumeration of the patron’s good\nqualities, the whole address is construed into an affront, and the\nwriter has the mortification to find his praise prostituted to very\nlittle purpose.On the other hand, should he yield to the transports of gratitude or\naffection, which is always apt to exaggerate, and produce no more than\nthe genuine effusions of his heart, the world will make no allowance\nfor the warmth of his passion, but ascribe the praise he bestows to\ninterested views and sordid adulation."

  "content": "Sometimes too, dazzled by the tinsel of a character which he has no\nopportunity to investigate, he pours forth the homage of his admiration\nupon some false Maecenas, whose future conduct gives the lie to his\neulogium, and involves him in shame and confusion of face. Such was the\nfate of a late ingenious author [the Author of the “Seasons”], who was\nso often put to the blush for the undeserved incense he had offered in\nthe heat of an enthusiastic disposition, misled by popular applause,\nthat he had resolved to retract, in his last will, all the encomiums\nwhich he had thus prematurely bestowed, and stigmatise the unworthy by\nname—a laudable scheme of poetical justice, the execution of which was\nfatally prevented by untimely death.Whatever may have been the fate of other dedicators, I, for my own\npart, sit down to write this address, without any apprehension of\ndisgrace or disappointment; because I know you are too well convinced\nof my affection and sincerity to repine at what I shall say touching\nyour character and conduct. And you will do me the justice to believe,\nthat this public distinction is a testimony of my particular friendship\nand esteem.Not that I am either insensible of your infirmities, or disposed to\nconceal them from the notice of mankind. There are certain foibles\nwhich can only be cured by shame and mortification; and whether or not\nyours be of that species, I shall have the comfort to think my best\nendeavours were used for your reformation.Know then, I can despise your pride, while I honour your integrity, and\napplaud your taste, while I am shocked at your ostentation.—I have\nknown you trifling, superficial, and obstinate in dispute; meanly\njealous and awkwardly reserved; rash and haughty in your resentments;\nand coarse and lowly in your connexions. I have blushed at the weakness\nof your conversation, and trembled at the errors of your conduct—yet,\nas I own you possess certain good qualities, which overbalance these\ndefects, and distinguish you on this occasion as a person for whom I\nhave the most perfect attachment and esteem, you have no cause to\ncomplain of the indelicacy with which your faults are reprehended. And\nas they are chiefly the excesses of a sanguine disposition and\nlooseness of thought, impatient of caution or control, you may, thus\nstimulated, watch over your own intemperance and infirmity with\nredoubled vigilance and consideration, and for the future profit by the\nseverity of my reproof."

  "content": "These, however, are not the only motives that induce me to trouble you\nwith this public application. I must not only perform my duty to my\nfriends, but also discharge the debt I owe to my own interest. We live\nin a censorious age; and an author cannot take too much precaution to\nanticipate the prejudice, misapprehension, and temerity of malice,\nignorance, and presumption.I therefore think it incumbent upon me to give some previous intimation\nof the plan which I have executed in the subsequent performance, that I\nmay not be condemned upon partial evidence; and to whom can I with more\npropriety appeal in my explanation than to you, who are so well\nacquainted with all the sentiments and emotions of my breast?A novel is a large diffused picture, comprehending the characters of\nlife, disposed in different groups, and exhibited in various attitudes,\nfor the purposes of an uniform plan, and general occurrence, to which\nevery individual figure is subservient. But this plan cannot be\nexecuted with propriety, probability, or success, without a principal\npersonage to attract the attention, unite the incidents, unwind the\nclue of the labyrinth, and at last close the scene, by virtue of his\nown importance.Almost all the heroes of this kind, who have hitherto succeeded on the\nEnglish stage, are characters of transcendent worth, conducted through\nthe vicissitudes of fortune, to that goal of happiness, which ever\nought to be the repose of extraordinary desert.—Yet the same principle\nby which we rejoice at the remuneration of merit, will teach us to\nrelish the disgrace and discomfiture of vice, which is always an\nexample of extensive use and influence, because it leaves a deep\nimpression of terror upon the minds of those who were not confirmed in\nthe pursuit of morality and virtue, and, while the balance wavers,\nenables the right scale to preponderate.In the drama, which is a more limited field of invention, the chief\npersonage is often the object of our detestation and abhorrence; and we\nare as well pleased to see the wicked schemes of a Richard blasted, and\nthe perfidy of a Maskwell exposed, as to behold a Bevil happy, and an\nEdward victorious."

  "content": "Cardinal de Retz very judiciously observes, that all historians must of\nnecessity be subject to mistakes, in explaining the motives of those\nactions they record, unless they derive their intelligence from the\ncandid confession of the person whose character they represent; and\nthat, of consequence, every man of importance ought to write his own\nmemoirs, provided he has honesty enough to tell the truth, without\nsuppressing any circumstance that may tend to the information of the\nreader. This, however, is a requisite that, I am afraid, would be very\nrarely found among the number of those who exhibit their own portraits\nto the public. Indeed, I will venture to say, that, how upright soever\na man’s intentions may be, he will, in the performance of such a task,\nbe sometimes misled by his own phantasy, and represent objects, as they\nappeared to him, through the mists of prejudice and passion.An unconcerned reader, when he peruses the history of two competitors,\nwho lived two thousand years ago, or who perhaps never had existence,\nexcept in the imagination of the author, cannot help interesting\nhimself in the dispute, and espousing one side of the contest, with all\nthe zeal of a warm adherent. What wonder, then, that we should be\nheated in our own concerns, review our actions with the same\nself-approbation that they had formerly acquired, and recommend them to\nthe world with all the enthusiasm of paternal affection?Supposing this to be the case, it was lucky for the cause of historical\ntruth, that so many pens have been drawn by writers, who could not be\nsuspected of such partiality; and that many great personages, among the\nancients as well as moderns, either would not or could not entertain\nthe public with their own memoirs. From this want of inclination or\ncapacity to write, in our hero himself, the undertaking is now left to\nme, of transmitting to posterity the remarkable adventures of FERDINAND\nCOUNT FATHOM; and by the time the reader shall have glanced over the\nsubsequent sheets, I doubt not but he will bless God that the\nadventurer was not his own historian."

He was heir to no visible patrimony,\nunless we reckon a robust constitution, a tolerable appearance, and an\nuncommon capacity, as the advantages of inheritance. If the comparison\nobtains in this point of consideration, he was as much as any man\nindebted to his parent; and pity it was, that, in the sequel of his\nfortune, he never had an opportunity of manifesting his filial\ngratitude and regard. From this agreeable act of duty to his sire, and\nall those tendernesses that are reciprocally enjoyed betwixt the father\nand the son, he was unhappily excluded by a small circumstance; at\nwhich, however, he was never heard to repine. In short, had he been\nbrought forth in the fabulous ages of the world, the nature of his\norigin might have turned to his account; he might, like other heroes of\nantiquity, have laid claim to divine extraction, without running the\nrisk of being claimed by an earthly father. Not that his parents had\nany reason to disown or renounce their offspring, or that there was\nanything preternatural in the circumstances of his generation and\nbirth; on the contrary, he was, from the beginning, a child of\npromising parts, and in due course of nature ushered into the world\namidst a whole cloud of witnesses. But, that he was acknowledged by no\nmortal sire, solely proceeded from the uncertainty of his mother, whose\naffections were so dissipated among a number of admirers, that she\ncould never pitch upon the person from whose loins our hero sprung.Over and above this important doubt under which he was begotten, other\nparticularities attended his birth, and seemed to mark him out as\nsomething uncommon among the sons of men. He was brought forth in a\nwaggon, and might be said to be literally a native of two different\ncountries; for, though he first saw the light in Holland, he was not\nborn till after the carriage arrived in Flanders; so that, all these\nextraordinary circumstances considered, the task of determining to what\ngovernment he naturally owed allegiance, would be at least as difficult\nas that of ascertaining the so much contested birthplace of Homer.Certain it is, the Count’s mother was an Englishwoman, who, after\nhaving been five times a widow in one campaign, was, in the last year\nof the renowned Marlborough’s command, numbered among the baggage of\nthe allied army, which she still accompanied, through pure benevolence\nof spirit, supplying the ranks with the refreshing streams of choice\nGeneva, and accommodating individuals with clean linen, as the\nemergency of their occasions required. Nor was her philanthropy\naltogether confined to such ministration; she abounded with “the milk\nof human kindness,” which flowed plentifully among her\nfellow-creatures; and to every son of Mars who cultivated her favour,\nshe liberally dispensed her smiles, in order to sweeten the toils and\ndangers of the field.And here it will not be amiss to anticipate the remarks of the reader,\nwho, in the chastity and excellency of his conception, may possibly\nexclaim, “Good Heaven! will these authors never reform their\nimaginations, and lift their ideas from the obscene objects of low\nlife? Must the public be again disgusted with the grovelling adventures\nof a waggon? Will no writer of genius draw his pen in the vindication\nof taste, and entertain us with the agreeable characters, the dignified\nconversation, the poignant repartee, in short, the genteel comedy of\nthe polite world?”"

Or,\nperhaps, of that class, who, in the sapience of taste, are disgusted\nwith those very flavours in the productions of their own country which\nhave yielded infinite delectation to their faculties, when imported\nfrom another clime; and d—n an author in despite of all precedent and\nprescription;—who extol the writings of Petronius Arbiter, read with\nrapture the amorous sallies of Ovid’s pen, and chuckle over the story\nof Lucian’s ass; yet, if a modern author presumes to relate the\nprogress of a simple intrigue, are shocked at the indecency and\nimmorality of the scene;—who delight in following Guzman d’Alfarache,\nthrough all the mazes of squalid beggary; who with pleasure accompany\nDon Quixote and his squire, in the lowest paths of fortune; who are\ndiverted with the adventures of Scarron’s ragged troop of strollers,\nand highly entertained with the servile situations of Gil Blas; yet,\nwhen a character in humble life occasionally occurs in a performance of\nour own growth, exclaim, with an air of disgust, “Was ever anything so\nmean! sure, this writer must have been very conversant with the lowest\nscenes of life;”—who, when Swift or Pope represents a coxcomb in the\nact of swearing, scruple not to laugh at the ridiculous execrations;\nbut, in a less reputed author, condemn the use of such profane\nexpletives;—who eagerly explore the jakes of Rabelais, for amusement,\nand even extract humour from the dean’s description of a lady’s\ndressing-room; yet in a production of these days, unstamped with such\nvenerable names, will stop their noses, with all the signs of loathing\nand abhorrence, at a bare mention of the china chamber-pot;—who\napplauded Catullus, Juvenal, Persius, and Lucan, for their spirit in\nlashing the greatest names of antiquity; yet, when a British satirist,\nof this generation, has courage enough to call in question the talents\nof a pseudo-patron in power, accuse him of insolence, rancour, and\nscurrility."

Our hero shall, with all\nconvenient despatch, be gradually sublimed into those splendid\nconnexions of which you are enamoured; and God forbid, that, in the\nmeantime, the nature of his extraction should turn to his prejudice in\na land of freedom like this, where individuals are every day ennobled\nin consequence of their own qualifications, without the least\nretrospective regard to the rank or merit of their ancestors. Yes,\nrefined reader, we are hastening to that goal of perfection, where\nsatire dares not show her face; where nature is castigated, almost even\nto still life; where humour turns changeling, and slavers in an insipid\ngrin; where wit is volatilised into a mere vapour; where decency,\ndivested of all substance, hovers about like a fantastic shadow; where\nthe salt of genius, escaping, leaves nothing but pure and simple\nphlegm; and the inoffensive pen for ever drops the mild manna of\nsoul-sweetening praise.CHAPTER TWOA SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF OUR HERO’S INFANCY.Having thus bespoken the indulgence of our guests, let us now produce\nthe particulars of our entertainment, and speedily conduct our\nadventurer through the stage of infancy, which seldom teems with\ninteresting incidents."

Thus determined, ere he was yet twelve days old, she\nenclosed him in a canvas knapsack, which being adjusted to her neck,\nfell down upon her back, and balanced the cargo that rested on her\nbosom.There are not wanting those who affirm, that, while her double charge\nwas carried about in this situation, her keg was furnished with a long\nand slender flexible tube, which, when the child began to be clamorous,\nshe conveyed into his mouth, and straight he stilled himself with\nsucking; but this we consider as an extravagant assertion of those who\nmix the marvellous in all their narrations, because we cannot conceive\nhow the tender organs of an infant could digest such a fiery beverage,\nwhich never fails to discompose the constitutions of the most hardy and\nrobust. We therefore conclude that the use of this potation was more\nrestrained, and that it was with simple element diluted into a\ncomposition adapted to his taste and years. Be this as it will, he\ncertainly was indulged in the use of it to such a degree as would have\neffectually obstructed his future fortune, had not he been happily\ncloyed with the repetition of the same fare, for which he conceived the\nutmost detestation and abhorrence, rejecting it with loathing and\ndisgust, like those choice spirits, who, having been crammed with\nreligion in their childhood, renounce it in their youth, among other\nabsurd prejudices of education.While he was thus dangled in a state of suspension, a German trooper\nwas transiently smit with the charms of his mother, who listened to his\nhonourable addresses, and once more received the silken bonds of\nmatrimony; the ceremony having been performed as usual at the\ndrum-head. The lady had no sooner taken possession of her new name,\nthan she bestowed it upon her son, who was thenceforward distinguished\nby the appellation of Ferdinand de Fadom; nor was the husband offended\nat this presumption in his wife, which he not only considered as a\nproof of her affection and esteem, but also as a compliment, by which\nhe might in time acquire the credit of being the real father of such a\nhopeful child."

Indeed this inclination\nwas enforced by another reason, that did not fail to influence her\nconduct in this particular; all her knowledge of the High Dutch\nlanguage consisted in some words of traffic absolutely necessary for\nthe practice of hex vocation, together with sundry oaths and terms of\nreproach, that kept her customers in awe; so that, except among her own\ncountrymen, she could not indulge that propensity to conversation, for\nwhich she had been remarkable from her earliest years. Nor did this\ninstance of her affection fail of turning to her account in the sequel.\nShe was promoted to the office of cook to a regimental mess of\nofficers; and, before the peace of Utrecht, was actually in possession\nof a suttling-tent, pitched for the accommodation of the gentlemen in\nthe army.Meanwhile, Ferdinand improved apace in the accomplishments of infancy;\nhis beauty was conspicuous, and his vigour so uncommon, that he was\nwith justice likened unto Hercules in the cradle. The friends of his\nfather-in-law dandled him on their knees, while he played with their\nwhiskers, and, before he was thirteen months old, taught him to suck\nbrandy impregnated with gunpowder, through the touch-hole of a pistol.\nAt the same time, he was caressed by divers serjeants of the British\narmy, who severally and in secret contemplated his qualifications with\na father’s pride, excited by the artful declaration with which the\nmother had flattered each apart.Soon as the war was (for her unhappily) concluded, she, as in duty\nbound, followed her husband into Bohemia; and his regiment being sent\ninto garrison at Prague, she opened a cabaret in that city, which was\nfrequented by a good many guests of the Scotch and Irish nations, who\nwere devoted to the exercise of arms in the service of the Emperor. It\nwas by this communication that the English tongue became vernacular to\nyoung Ferdinand, who, without such opportunity, would have been a\nstranger to the language of his forefathers, in spite of all his\nmother’s loquacity and elocution; though it must be owned, for the\ncredit of her maternal care, that she let slip no occasion of making it\nfamiliar to his ear and conception; for, even at those intervals in\nwhich she could find no person to carry on the altercation, she used to\nhold forth in earnest soliloquies upon the subject of her own\nsituation, giving vent to many opprobrious invectives against her\nhusband’s country, between which and Old England she drew many odious\ncomparisons; and prayed, without ceasing, that Europe might speedily be\ninvolved in a general war, so as that she might have some chance of\nre-enjoying the pleasures and emoluments of a Flanders campaign.CHAPTER THREEHE IS INITIATED IN A MILITARY LIFE, AND HAS THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ACQUIRE\nA GENEROUS PATRON."

On account of this expedition, the mother of our hero gave up\nhousekeeping, and cheerfully followed her customers and husband into\nthe field; having first provided herself with store of those\ncommodities in which she had formerly merchandised. Although the hope\nof profit might in some measure affect her determination, one of the\nchief motives for her visiting the frontiers of Turkey, was the desire\nof initiating her son in the rudiments of his education, which she now\nthought high time to inculcate, he being, at this period, in the sixth\nyear of his age; he was accordingly conducted to the camp, which she\nconsidered as the most consummate school of life, and proposed for the\nscene of his instruction; and in this academy he had not continued many\nweeks, when he was an eye-witness of that famous victory, which, with\nsixty thousand men, the Imperial general obtained over an army of one\nhundred and fifty thousand Turks.His father-in-law was engaged, and his mother would not be idle on this\noccasion. She was a perfect mistress of all the camp qualifications,\nand thought it a duty incumbent on her to contribute all that lay in\nher power towards distressing the enemy. With these sentiments she\nhovered about the skirts of the army, and the troops were no sooner\nemployed in the pursuit, than she began to traverse the field of battle\nwith a poignard and a bag, in order to consult her own interest, annoy\nthe foe, and exercise her humanity at the same time. In short, she had,\nwith amazing prowess, delivered some fifty or threescore disabled\nMussulmen of the pain under which they groaned, and made a comfortable\nbooty of the spoils of the slain, when her eyes were attracted by the\nrich attire of an Imperial officer, who lay bleeding on the plain, to\nall appearance in the agonies of death."

As she approached this\ndeplorable object of pity, her ears were surprised with an ejaculation\nin the English tongue, which he fervently pronounced, though with a\nweak and languid voice, recommending his soul to God, and his family to\nthe protection of Heaven. Our Amazon’s purpose was staggered by this\nprovidential incident; the sound of her native language, so\nunexpectedly heard, and so pathetically delivered, had a surprising\neffect upon her imagination; and the faculty of reflection did not\nforsake her in such emergency. Though she could not recollect the\nfeatures of this unhappy officer, she concluded, from his appearance,\nthat he was some person of distinction in the service, and foresaw\ngreater advantage to herself in attempting to preserve his life, than\nshe could possibly reap from the execution of her first resolve. “If,”\nsaid she to herself, “I can find means of conveying him to his tent\nalive, he cannot but in conscience acknowledge my humanity with some\nconsiderable recompense; and, should he chance to survive his wounds, I\nhave everything to expect from his gratitude and power.”Fraught with these prudential suggestions, she drew near the\nunfortunate stranger, and, in a softened accent of pity and condolence,\nquestioned him concerning his name, condition, and the nature of his\nmischance, at the same time making a gentle tender of her service.\nAgreeably surprised to hear himself accosted in such a manner, by a\nperson whose equipage seemed to promise far other designs, he thanked\nher in the most grateful terms for her humanity, with the appellation\nof kind countrywoman; gave her to understand that he was colonel of a\nregiment of horse; that he had fallen in consequence of a shot he\nreceived in his breast at the beginning of the action; and, finally,\nentreated her to procure some carriage on which he might be removed to\nhis tent. Perceiving him faint and exhausted with loss of blood, she\nraised up his head, and treated him with that cordial which was her\nconstant companion. At that instant, espying a small body of hussars\nreturning to the camp with the plunder they had taken, she invoked\ntheir assistance, and they forthwith carried the officer to his own\nquarters, where his wound was dressed, and his preserver carefully\ntended him until his recovery was completed.In return for these good offices, this gentleman, who was originally of\nScotland, rewarded her for the present with great liberality, assured\nher of his influence in promoting her husband, and took upon himself\nthe charge of young Ferdinand’s education; the boy was immediately\ntaken into his protection, and entered as a trooper in his own\nregiment; but his good intentions towards his father-in-law were\nfrustrated by the death of the German, who, in a few days after this\ndisposition, was shot in the trenches before Temiswaer."
