  "content": "﻿THE ADVENTURES OF FERDINAND COUNT FATHOMTO DOCTOR ———You and I, my good friend, have often deliberated on the difficulty of\nwriting such a dedication as might gratify the self-complacency of a\npatron, without exposing the author to the ridicule or censure of the\npublic; and I think we generally agreed that the task was altogether\nimpracticable.—Indeed, this was one of the few subjects on which we\nhave always thought in the same manner. For, notwithstanding that\ndeference and regard which we mutually pay to each other, certain it\nis, we have often differed, according to the predominancy of those\ndifferent passions, which frequently warp the opinion, and perplex the\nunderstanding of the most judicious.In dedication, as in poetry, there is no medium; for, if any one of the\nhuman virtues be omitted in the enumeration of the patron’s good\nqualities, the whole address is construed into an affront, and the\nwriter has the mortification to find his praise prostituted to very\nlittle purpose.On the other hand, should he yield to the transports of gratitude or\naffection, which is always apt to exaggerate, and produce no more than\nthe genuine effusions of his heart, the world will make no allowance\nfor the warmth of his passion, but ascribe the praise he bestows to\ninterested views and sordid adulation."

Such was the\nfate of a late ingenious author [the Author of the “Seasons”], who was\nso often put to the blush for the undeserved incense he had offered in\nthe heat of an enthusiastic disposition, misled by popular applause,\nthat he had resolved to retract, in his last will, all the encomiums\nwhich he had thus prematurely bestowed, and stigmatise the unworthy by\nname—a laudable scheme of poetical justice, the execution of which was\nfatally prevented by untimely death.Whatever may have been the fate of other dedicators, I, for my own\npart, sit down to write this address, without any apprehension of\ndisgrace or disappointment; because I know you are too well convinced\nof my affection and sincerity to repine at what I shall say touching\nyour character and conduct. And you will do me the justice to believe,\nthat this public distinction is a testimony of my particular friendship\nand esteem.Not that I am either insensible of your infirmities, or disposed to\nconceal them from the notice of mankind. There are certain foibles\nwhich can only be cured by shame and mortification; and whether or not\nyours be of that species, I shall have the comfort to think my best\nendeavours were used for your reformation.Know then, I can despise your pride, while I honour your integrity, and\napplaud your taste, while I am shocked at your ostentation.—I have\nknown you trifling, superficial, and obstinate in dispute; meanly\njealous and awkwardly reserved; rash and haughty in your resentments;\nand coarse and lowly in your connexions. I have blushed at the weakness\nof your conversation, and trembled at the errors of your conduct—yet,\nas I own you possess certain good qualities, which overbalance these\ndefects, and distinguish you on this occasion as a person for whom I\nhave the most perfect attachment and esteem, you have no cause to\ncomplain of the indelicacy with which your faults are reprehended. And\nas they are chiefly the excesses of a sanguine disposition and\nlooseness of thought, impatient of caution or control, you may, thus\nstimulated, watch over your own intemperance and infirmity with\nredoubled vigilance and consideration, and for the future profit by the\nseverity of my reproof."

I must not only perform my duty to my\nfriends, but also discharge the debt I owe to my own interest. We live\nin a censorious age; and an author cannot take too much precaution to\nanticipate the prejudice, misapprehension, and temerity of malice,\nignorance, and presumption.I therefore think it incumbent upon me to give some previous intimation\nof the plan which I have executed in the subsequent performance, that I\nmay not be condemned upon partial evidence; and to whom can I with more\npropriety appeal in my explanation than to you, who are so well\nacquainted with all the sentiments and emotions of my breast?A novel is a large diffused picture, comprehending the characters of\nlife, disposed in different groups, and exhibited in various attitudes,\nfor the purposes of an uniform plan, and general occurrence, to which\nevery individual figure is subservient. But this plan cannot be\nexecuted with propriety, probability, or success, without a principal\npersonage to attract the attention, unite the incidents, unwind the\nclue of the labyrinth, and at last close the scene, by virtue of his\nown importance.Almost all the heroes of this kind, who have hitherto succeeded on the\nEnglish stage, are characters of transcendent worth, conducted through\nthe vicissitudes of fortune, to that goal of happiness, which ever\nought to be the repose of extraordinary desert.—Yet the same principle\nby which we rejoice at the remuneration of merit, will teach us to\nrelish the disgrace and discomfiture of vice, which is always an\nexample of extensive use and influence, because it leaves a deep\nimpression of terror upon the minds of those who were not confirmed in\nthe pursuit of morality and virtue, and, while the balance wavers,\nenables the right scale to preponderate.In the drama, which is a more limited field of invention, the chief\npersonage is often the object of our detestation and abhorrence; and we\nare as well pleased to see the wicked schemes of a Richard blasted, and\nthe perfidy of a Maskwell exposed, as to behold a Bevil happy, and an\nEdward victorious."

  "content": "Cardinal de Retz very judiciously observes, that all historians must of\nnecessity be subject to mistakes, in explaining the motives of those\nactions they record, unless they derive their intelligence from the\ncandid confession of the person whose character they represent; and\nthat, of consequence, every man of importance ought to write his own\nmemoirs, provided he has honesty enough to tell the truth, without\nsuppressing any circumstance that may tend to the information of the\nreader. This, however, is a requisite that, I am afraid, would be very\nrarely found among the number of those who exhibit their own portraits\nto the public. Indeed, I will venture to say, that, how upright soever\na man’s intentions may be, he will, in the performance of such a task,\nbe sometimes misled by his own phantasy, and represent objects, as they\nappeared to him, through the mists of prejudice and passion.An unconcerned reader, when he peruses the history of two competitors,\nwho lived two thousand years ago, or who perhaps never had existence,\nexcept in the imagination of the author, cannot help interesting\nhimself in the dispute, and espousing one side of the contest, with all\nthe zeal of a warm adherent. What wonder, then, that we should be\nheated in our own concerns, review our actions with the same\nself-approbation that they had formerly acquired, and recommend them to\nthe world with all the enthusiasm of paternal affection?Supposing this to be the case, it was lucky for the cause of historical\ntruth, that so many pens have been drawn by writers, who could not be\nsuspected of such partiality; and that many great personages, among the\nancients as well as moderns, either would not or could not entertain\nthe public with their own memoirs. From this want of inclination or\ncapacity to write, in our hero himself, the undertaking is now left to\nme, of transmitting to posterity the remarkable adventures of FERDINAND\nCOUNT FATHOM; and by the time the reader shall have glanced over the\nsubsequent sheets, I doubt not but he will bless God that the\nadventurer was not his own historian."

  "content": "This mirror of modern chivalry was none of those who owe their dignity\nto the circumstances of their birth, and are consecrated from the\ncradle for the purposes of greatness, merely because they are the\naccidental children of wealth. He was heir to no visible patrimony,\nunless we reckon a robust constitution, a tolerable appearance, and an\nuncommon capacity, as the advantages of inheritance. If the comparison\nobtains in this point of consideration, he was as much as any man\nindebted to his parent; and pity it was, that, in the sequel of his\nfortune, he never had an opportunity of manifesting his filial\ngratitude and regard. From this agreeable act of duty to his sire, and\nall those tendernesses that are reciprocally enjoyed betwixt the father\nand the son, he was unhappily excluded by a small circumstance; at\nwhich, however, he was never heard to repine. In short, had he been\nbrought forth in the fabulous ages of the world, the nature of his\norigin might have turned to his account; he might, like other heroes of\nantiquity, have laid claim to divine extraction, without running the\nrisk of being claimed by an earthly father. Not that his parents had\nany reason to disown or renounce their offspring, or that there was\nanything preternatural in the circumstances of his generation and\nbirth; on the contrary, he was, from the beginning, a child of\npromising parts, and in due course of nature ushered into the world\namidst a whole cloud of witnesses. But, that he was acknowledged by no\nmortal sire, solely proceeded from the uncertainty of his mother, whose\naffections were so dissipated among a number of admirers, that she\ncould never pitch upon the person from whose loins our hero sprung.Over and above this important doubt under which he was begotten, other\nparticularities attended his birth, and seemed to mark him out as\nsomething uncommon among the sons of men. He was brought forth in a\nwaggon, and might be said to be literally a native of two different\ncountries; for, though he first saw the light in Holland, he was not\nborn till after the carriage arrived in Flanders; so that, all these\nextraordinary circumstances considered, the task of determining to what\ngovernment he naturally owed allegiance, would be at least as difficult\nas that of ascertaining the so much contested birthplace of Homer.Certain it is, the Count’s mother was an Englishwoman, who, after\nhaving been five times a widow in one campaign, was, in the last year\nof the renowned Marlborough’s command, numbered among the baggage of\nthe allied army, which she still accompanied, through pure benevolence\nof spirit, supplying the ranks with the refreshing streams of choice\nGeneva, and accommodating individuals with clean linen, as the\nemergency of their occasions required. Nor was her philanthropy\naltogether confined to such ministration; she abounded with “the milk\nof human kindness,” which flowed plentifully among her\nfellow-creatures; and to every son of Mars who cultivated her favour,\nshe liberally dispensed her smiles, in order to sweeten the toils and\ndangers of the field.And here it will not be amiss to anticipate the remarks of the reader,\nwho, in the chastity and excellency of his conception, may possibly\nexclaim, “Good Heaven! will these authors never reform their\nimaginations, and lift their ideas from the obscene objects of low\nlife? Must the public be again disgusted with the grovelling adventures\nof a waggon? Will no writer of genius draw his pen in the vindication\nof taste, and entertain us with the agreeable characters, the dignified\nconversation, the poignant repartee, in short, the genteel comedy of\nthe polite world?”"

Thus determined, ere he was yet twelve days old, she\nenclosed him in a canvas knapsack, which being adjusted to her neck,\nfell down upon her back, and balanced the cargo that rested on her\nbosom.There are not wanting those who affirm, that, while her double charge\nwas carried about in this situation, her keg was furnished with a long\nand slender flexible tube, which, when the child began to be clamorous,\nshe conveyed into his mouth, and straight he stilled himself with\nsucking; but this we consider as an extravagant assertion of those who\nmix the marvellous in all their narrations, because we cannot conceive\nhow the tender organs of an infant could digest such a fiery beverage,\nwhich never fails to discompose the constitutions of the most hardy and\nrobust. We therefore conclude that the use of this potation was more\nrestrained, and that it was with simple element diluted into a\ncomposition adapted to his taste and years. Be this as it will, he\ncertainly was indulged in the use of it to such a degree as would have\neffectually obstructed his future fortune, had not he been happily\ncloyed with the repetition of the same fare, for which he conceived the\nutmost detestation and abhorrence, rejecting it with loathing and\ndisgust, like those choice spirits, who, having been crammed with\nreligion in their childhood, renounce it in their youth, among other\nabsurd prejudices of education.While he was thus dangled in a state of suspension, a German trooper\nwas transiently smit with the charms of his mother, who listened to his\nhonourable addresses, and once more received the silken bonds of\nmatrimony; the ceremony having been performed as usual at the\ndrum-head. The lady had no sooner taken possession of her new name,\nthan she bestowed it upon her son, who was thenceforward distinguished\nby the appellation of Ferdinand de Fadom; nor was the husband offended\nat this presumption in his wife, which he not only considered as a\nproof of her affection and esteem, but also as a compliment, by which\nhe might in time acquire the credit of being the real father of such a\nhopeful child."

Indeed this inclination\nwas enforced by another reason, that did not fail to influence her\nconduct in this particular; all her knowledge of the High Dutch\nlanguage consisted in some words of traffic absolutely necessary for\nthe practice of hex vocation, together with sundry oaths and terms of\nreproach, that kept her customers in awe; so that, except among her own\ncountrymen, she could not indulge that propensity to conversation, for\nwhich she had been remarkable from her earliest years. Nor did this\ninstance of her affection fail of turning to her account in the sequel.\nShe was promoted to the office of cook to a regimental mess of\nofficers; and, before the peace of Utrecht, was actually in possession\nof a suttling-tent, pitched for the accommodation of the gentlemen in\nthe army.Meanwhile, Ferdinand improved apace in the accomplishments of infancy;\nhis beauty was conspicuous, and his vigour so uncommon, that he was\nwith justice likened unto Hercules in the cradle. The friends of his\nfather-in-law dandled him on their knees, while he played with their\nwhiskers, and, before he was thirteen months old, taught him to suck\nbrandy impregnated with gunpowder, through the touch-hole of a pistol.\nAt the same time, he was caressed by divers serjeants of the British\narmy, who severally and in secret contemplated his qualifications with\na father’s pride, excited by the artful declaration with which the\nmother had flattered each apart.Soon as the war was (for her unhappily) concluded, she, as in duty\nbound, followed her husband into Bohemia; and his regiment being sent\ninto garrison at Prague, she opened a cabaret in that city, which was\nfrequented by a good many guests of the Scotch and Irish nations, who\nwere devoted to the exercise of arms in the service of the Emperor. It\nwas by this communication that the English tongue became vernacular to\nyoung Ferdinand, who, without such opportunity, would have been a\nstranger to the language of his forefathers, in spite of all his\nmother’s loquacity and elocution; though it must be owned, for the\ncredit of her maternal care, that she let slip no occasion of making it\nfamiliar to his ear and conception; for, even at those intervals in\nwhich she could find no person to carry on the altercation, she used to\nhold forth in earnest soliloquies upon the subject of her own\nsituation, giving vent to many opprobrious invectives against her\nhusband’s country, between which and Old England she drew many odious\ncomparisons; and prayed, without ceasing, that Europe might speedily be\ninvolved in a general war, so as that she might have some chance of\nre-enjoying the pleasures and emoluments of a Flanders campaign.CHAPTER THREEHE IS INITIATED IN A MILITARY LIFE, AND HAS THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ACQUIRE\nA GENEROUS PATRON."

On account of this expedition, the mother of our hero gave up\nhousekeeping, and cheerfully followed her customers and husband into\nthe field; having first provided herself with store of those\ncommodities in which she had formerly merchandised. Although the hope\nof profit might in some measure affect her determination, one of the\nchief motives for her visiting the frontiers of Turkey, was the desire\nof initiating her son in the rudiments of his education, which she now\nthought high time to inculcate, he being, at this period, in the sixth\nyear of his age; he was accordingly conducted to the camp, which she\nconsidered as the most consummate school of life, and proposed for the\nscene of his instruction; and in this academy he had not continued many\nweeks, when he was an eye-witness of that famous victory, which, with\nsixty thousand men, the Imperial general obtained over an army of one\nhundred and fifty thousand Turks.His father-in-law was engaged, and his mother would not be idle on this\noccasion. She was a perfect mistress of all the camp qualifications,\nand thought it a duty incumbent on her to contribute all that lay in\nher power towards distressing the enemy. With these sentiments she\nhovered about the skirts of the army, and the troops were no sooner\nemployed in the pursuit, than she began to traverse the field of battle\nwith a poignard and a bag, in order to consult her own interest, annoy\nthe foe, and exercise her humanity at the same time. In short, she had,\nwith amazing prowess, delivered some fifty or threescore disabled\nMussulmen of the pain under which they groaned, and made a comfortable\nbooty of the spoils of the slain, when her eyes were attracted by the\nrich attire of an Imperial officer, who lay bleeding on the plain, to\nall appearance in the agonies of death."

Our Amazon’s purpose was staggered by this\nprovidential incident; the sound of her native language, so\nunexpectedly heard, and so pathetically delivered, had a surprising\neffect upon her imagination; and the faculty of reflection did not\nforsake her in such emergency. Though she could not recollect the\nfeatures of this unhappy officer, she concluded, from his appearance,\nthat he was some person of distinction in the service, and foresaw\ngreater advantage to herself in attempting to preserve his life, than\nshe could possibly reap from the execution of her first resolve. “If,”\nsaid she to herself, “I can find means of conveying him to his tent\nalive, he cannot but in conscience acknowledge my humanity with some\nconsiderable recompense; and, should he chance to survive his wounds, I\nhave everything to expect from his gratitude and power.”Fraught with these prudential suggestions, she drew near the\nunfortunate stranger, and, in a softened accent of pity and condolence,\nquestioned him concerning his name, condition, and the nature of his\nmischance, at the same time making a gentle tender of her service.\nAgreeably surprised to hear himself accosted in such a manner, by a\nperson whose equipage seemed to promise far other designs, he thanked\nher in the most grateful terms for her humanity, with the appellation\nof kind countrywoman; gave her to understand that he was colonel of a\nregiment of horse; that he had fallen in consequence of a shot he\nreceived in his breast at the beginning of the action; and, finally,\nentreated her to procure some carriage on which he might be removed to\nhis tent. Perceiving him faint and exhausted with loss of blood, she\nraised up his head, and treated him with that cordial which was her\nconstant companion. At that instant, espying a small body of hussars\nreturning to the camp with the plunder they had taken, she invoked\ntheir assistance, and they forthwith carried the officer to his own\nquarters, where his wound was dressed, and his preserver carefully\ntended him until his recovery was completed.In return for these good offices, this gentleman, who was originally of\nScotland, rewarded her for the present with great liberality, assured\nher of his influence in promoting her husband, and took upon himself\nthe charge of young Ferdinand’s education; the boy was immediately\ntaken into his protection, and entered as a trooper in his own\nregiment; but his good intentions towards his father-in-law were\nfrustrated by the death of the German, who, in a few days after this\ndisposition, was shot in the trenches before Temiswaer."

She was no sooner apprised of the general’s\nintention to attack the enemy, than she, as usual, packed up her\nmoveables in a waggon, which she committed to the care of a peasant in\nthe neighbourhood, and put herself in motion with the troops; big with\nthe expectation of re-acting that part in which she had formerly\nacquitted herself so much to her advantage.—Nay, she by this time\nlooked upon her own presence as a certain omen of success to the cause\nwhich she espoused; and, in their march to battle, actually encouraged\nthe ranks with repeated declarations, importing, that she had been\neye-witness of ten decisive engagements, in all of which her friends\nhad been victorious, and imputing such uncommon good fortune to some\nsupernatural quality inherent in her person."

But, certain it is, the\nvictory began from that quarter in which she had posted herself; and no\ncorps in the army behaved with such intrepidity as that which was\nmanifested by those who were favoured with her admonitions and example;\nfor she not only exposed her person to the enemy’s fire, with the\nindifference and deliberation of a veteran, but she is said to have\nachieved a very conspicuous exploit by the prowess of her single arm.\nThe extremity of the line to which she had attached herself, being\nassaulted in flank by a body of the spahis, wheeled about, in order to\nsustain the charge, and received them with such a seasonable fire, as\nbrought a great number of turbans to the ground; among those who fell,\nwas one of the chiefs or agas, who had advanced before the rest, with a\nview to signalise his valour.Our English Penthesilea no sooner saw this Turkish leader drop, than,\nstruck with the magnificence of his own and horse’s trappings, she\nsprung forward to seize them as her prize, and found the aga not dead,\nthough in a good measure disabled by his misfortune, which was entirely\nowing to the weight of his horse, that, having been killed by a\nmusket-ball, lay upon his leg, so that he could not disengage himself.\nNevertheless, perceiving the virago approach with fell intent, he\nbrandished his symitar, and tried to intimidate his assailant with a\nmost horrible exclamation; but it was not the dismal yell of a\ndismounted cavalier, though enforced with a hideous ferocity of\ncountenance, and the menacing gestures with which he waited her\napproach, that could intimidate such an undaunted she-campaigner; she\nsaw him writhing in the agonies of a situation from which he could not\nmove; and, running towards him with the nimbleness and intrepidity of a\nCamilla, described a semicircle in the progress of her assault, and\nattacking him on one side, plunged her well-tried dagger in his throat.\nThe shades of death encompassed him, his life-blood issued at the\nwound, he fell prone upon the earth, he bit the dust, and having thrice\ninvoked the name of Allah! straight expired."

The Imperialists, observing the confusion of the enemy,\nredoubled their fire; and, raising a dreadful shout, advanced in order\nto improve the advantage they had gained. The spahis durst not wait the\nshock of such an encounter; they wheeled to the right-about, and\nclapping spurs to their horses, fled in the utmost disorder. This was\nactually the circumstance that turned the scale of battle. The\nAustrians pursued their good fortune with uncommon impetuosity, and in\na few minutes left the field clear for the mother of our hero, who was\nsuch an adept in the art of stripping, that in the twinkling of an eye\nthe bodies of the aga and his Arabian lay naked to the skin. It would\nhave been happy for her, had she been contented with these\nfirst-fruits, reaped from the fortune of the day, and retired with her\nspoils, which were not inconsiderable; but, intoxicated with the glory\nshe had won, enticed by the glittering caparisons that lay scattered on\nthe plain, and without doubt prompted by the secret instinct of her\nfate, she resolved to seize opportunity by the forelock, and once for\nall indemnify herself for the many fatigues, hazards, and sorrows she\nhad undergone.Thus determined, she reconnoitred the field, and practised her address\nso successfully, that in less than half an hour she was loaded with\nermine and embroidery, and disposed to retreat with her burden, when\nher regards were solicited by a splendid bundle, which she descried at\nsome distance lying on the ground. This was no other than an unhappy\nofficer of hussars; who, after having the good fortune to take a\nTurkish standard, was desperately wounded in the thigh, and obliged to\nquit his horse; finding himself in such a helpless condition, he had\nwrapped his acquisition round his body, that whatever might happen, he\nand his glory should not be parted; and thus shrouded, among the dying\nand the dead, he had observed the progress of our heroine, who stalked\nabout the field, like another Atropos, finishing, wherever she came,\nthe work of death. He did not at all doubt, that he himself would be\nvisited in the course of her peregrinations, and therefore provided for\nher reception, with a pistol ready cocked in his hand, while he lay\nperdue beneath his covert, in all appearance bereft of life. He was not\ndeceived in his prognostic; she no sooner eyed the golden crescent\nthan, inflamed with curiosity or cupidity, she directed thitherward her\nsteps, and discerning the carcase of a man, from which, she thought,\nthere would be a necessity for disengaging it, she lifted up her\nweapon, in order to make sure of her purchase; and in the very instant\nof discharging her blow, received a brace of bullets in her brain."

It cannot be\nsupposed that this catastrophe made a very deep impression upon the\nmind of young Ferdinand, who had just then attained the ninth year of\nhis age, and been for a considerable time weaned from her maternal\ncaresses; especially as he felt no wants nor grievances in the family\nof the Count, who favoured him with a particular share of indulgence,\nbecause he perceived in him a spirit of docility, insinuation, and\nsagacity, far above his years. He did not, however, fail to lament the\nuntimely fate of his mother, with such filial expressions of sorrow, as\nstill more intimately recommended him to his patron; who, being himself\na man of extraordinary benevolence, looked upon the boy as a prodigy of\nnatural affection, and foresaw in his future services a fund of\ngratitude and attachment, that could not fail to render him a valuable\nacquisition to his family.In his own country, he had often seen connexions of that sort, which\nhaving been planted in the infancy of the adherent, had grown up to a\nsurprising pitch of fidelity and friendship, that no temptation could\nbias, and no danger dissolve. He therefore rejoiced in the hope of\nseeing his own son accommodated with such a faithful attendant, in the\nperson of young Fathom, on whom he resolved to bestow the same\neducation he had planned for the other, though conveyed in such a\nmanner as should be suitable to the sphere in which he was ordained to\nmove. In consequence of these determinations, our young adventurer led\na very easy life, in quality of page to the Count, in whose tent he lay\nupon a pallet, close to his field-bed, and often diverted him with his\nchildish prattle in the English tongue, which the more seldom his\nmaster had occasion to speak, he the more delighted to hear. In the\nexercise of his function, the boy was incredibly assiduous and alert;\nfar from neglecting the little particulars of his duty, and embarking\nin the mischievous amusements of the children belonging to the camp, he\nwas always diligent, sedate, agreeably officious and anticipating; and\nin the whole of his behaviour seemed to express the most vigilant sense\nof his patron’s goodness and generosity; nay, to such a degree had\nthese sentiments, in all appearance, operated upon his reflection, that\none morning, while he supposed the Count asleep, he crept softly to his\nbedside, and gently kissing his hand, which happened to be uncovered,\npronounced, in a low voice, a most fervent prayer in his behalf,\nbeseeching Heaven to shower down blessings upon him, as the widow’s\nfriend and the orphan’s father. This benediction was not lost upon the\nCount, who chanced to be awake, and heard it with admiration; but what\nriveted Ferdinand in his good graces, was a discovery that our youth\nmade, while his master was upon duty in the trenches before Belgrade."

The particulars of this plan were concerted in the French\nlanguage, which, they imagined, would screen them from all risk of\nbeing detected, in case they should be overheard, though, as there was\nno living creature in sight, they had no reason to believe that any\nperson was privy to their conversation. Nevertheless, they were\nmistaken in both these conjectures. The conference reached the ears of\nFathom, who was at the other end of the tent, and had perceived the\neager looks with which they considered some parts of the furniture. He\nhad penetration enough to suspect their desire, and, alarmed by that\nsuspicion, listened attentively to their discourse; which, from a\nslender knowledge in the French tongue, he had the good fortune partly\nto understand.This important piece of intelligence he communicated to the Count at\nhis return, and measures were immediately taken to defeat the design,\nand make an example of the authors, who being permitted to load\nthemselves with the booty, were apprehended in their retreat, and\npunished with death according to their demerits.CHAPTER FIVEA BRIEF DETAIL OF HIS EDUCATION.Nothing could have more seasonably happened to confirm the good opinion\nwhich the colonel entertained of Ferdinand’s principles. His intentions\ntowards the boy grew every day more and more warm; and, immediately\nafter the peace of Passarowitz, he retired to his own house at\nPresburg, and presented young Fathom to his lady, not only as the son\nof a person to whom he owed his life, but also as a lad who merited his\npeculiar protection and regard by his own personal virtue. The\nCountess, who was an Hungarian, received him with great kindness and\naffability, and her son was ravished with the prospect of enjoying such\na companion. In short, fortune seemed to have provided for him an\nasylum, in which he might be safely trained up, and suitably prepared\nfor more important scenes of life than any of his ancestors had ever\nknown."

Ferdinand was entered\nin the same academy; and the two lads proceeded equally in the paths of\nerudition; a mutual friendship and intimacy soon ensued, and,\nnotwithstanding the levity and caprice commonly discernible in the\nbehaviour of such boys, very few or rather no quarrels happened in the\ncourse of their communication. Yet their dispositions were altogether\ndifferent, and their talents unlike. Nay, this dissimilarity was the\nvery bond of their union; because it prevented that jealousy and\nrivalship which often interrupts the harmony of two warm\ncontemporaries.The young Count made extraordinary progress in the exercises of the\nschool, though he seemed to take very little pains in the cultivation\nof his studies; and became a perfect hero in all the athletic\ndiversions of his fellow-scholars; but, at the same time, exhibited\nsuch a bashful appearance and uncouth address, that his mother\ndespaired of ever seeing him improved into any degree of polite\nbehaviour. On the other hand, Fathom, who was in point of learning a\nmere dunce, became, even in his childhood, remarkable among the ladies\nfor his genteel deportment and vivacity; they admired the proficiency\nhe made under the directions of his dancing-master, the air with which\nhe performed his obeisance at his entrance and exit; and were charmed\nwith the agreeable assurance and lively sallies of his conversation;\nwhile they expressed the utmost concern and disgust at the boorish\ndemeanour of his companion, whose extorted bows resembled the pawings\nof a mule, who hung his head in silence like a detected sheep-stealer,\nwho sat in company under the most awkward expressions of constraint,\nand whose discourse never exceeded the simple monosyllables of negation\nand assent."

He remained unaltered by all their efforts\nand expostulations, and allowed our adventurer to enjoy the triumph of\nhis praise, while he himself was conscious of his own superiority in\nthose qualifications which seemed of more real importance than the mere\nexteriors and forms of life. His present ambition was not to make a\nfigure at his father’s table, but to eclipse his rivals at school, and\nto acquire an influence and authority among these confederates.\nNevertheless, Fathom might possibly have fallen under his displeasure\nor contempt, had not that pliant genius found means to retain his\nfriendship by seasonable compliances and submission; for the sole\nstudy, or at least the chief aim of Ferdinand, was to make himself\nnecessary and agreeable to those on whom his dependence was placed. His\ntalent was in this particular suited to his inclination; he seemed to\nhave inherited it from his mother’s womb; and, without all doubt, would\nhave raised upon it a most admirable superstructure of fortune and\napplause, had not it been inseparably yoked with a most insidious\nprinciple of self-love, that grew up with him from the cradle, and left\nno room in his heart for the least particle of social virtue. This\nlast, however, he knew so well how to counterfeit, by means of a large\nshare of ductility and dissimulation, that, surely, he was calculated\nby nature to dupe even the most cautious, and gratify his appetites, by\nlevying contributions on all mankind.So little are the common instructors of youth qualified to judge the\ncapacities of those who are under their tutelage and care, that Fathom,\nby dint of his insinuating arts, made shift to pass upon the\nschoolmaster as a lad of quick parts, in despite of a natural\ninaptitude to retain his lessons, which all his industry could never\novercome. In order to remedy, or rather to cloak this defect in his\nunderstanding, he had always recourse to the friendship of the young\nCount, who freely permitted him to transcribe his exercises, until a\nsmall accident happened, which had well-nigh put a stop to these\ninstances of his generosity.—The adventure, inconsiderable as it is, we\nshall record, as the first overt act of Ferdinand’s true character, as\nwell as an illustration of the opinion we have advanced touching the\nblind and injudicious decisions of a right pedagogue."
