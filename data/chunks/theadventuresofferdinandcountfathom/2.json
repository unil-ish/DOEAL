He redoubled, if possible, his deference and respect,\nwhetting his assiduity to the keenest edge of attention; and, in short,\nregulated his dress, conversation, and deportment, according to the\nfancy, turn, and prevailing humour of his young mistress. He, moreover,\nattempted to profit by her curiosity, which he knew to be truly\nfeminine; and having culled from the library of his patron certain\ndangerous books, calculated to debauch the minds of young people, left\nthem occasionally upon the table in his apartment, after having\ndirected Teresa to pick them up, as if by accident, in his absence, and\ncarry them off for the entertainment of Mademoiselle; nay, this crafty\nprojector found means to furnish his associate with some mischievous\npreparations, which were mingled in her chocolate, tea, or coffee, as\nprovocations to warm her constitution; yet all these machinations,\ningenious as they were, failed, not only in fulfilling their aim, but\neven in shaking the foundations of her virtue or pride, which stood\ntheir assaults unmoved, like a strong tower built upon a rock,\nimpregnable to all the tempestuous blasts of heaven.Not but that the conspirators were more than once mistaken in the\neffects of their artifices, and disposed to applaud themselves on the\nprogress they had made. When at any time she expressed a desire to\nexamine those performances which were laid before her as snares to\nentrap her chastity, they attributed that, which was no other than\ncuriosity, to a looseness of sentiment; and when she discovered no\naversion to hear those anecdotes concerning the frailty of her\nneighbours, they imputed to abatement of chastity that satisfaction\nwhich was the result of self-congratulation on her own superior virtue.So far did the treacherous accomplice of Fathom presume upon these\nmisconstructions, that she at length divested her tongue of all\nrestraint, and behaved in such a manner, that the young lady,\nconfounded and incensed at her indecency and impudence, rebuked her\nwith great severity, and commanded her to reform her discourse, on pain\nof being dismissed with disgrace from her service.CHAPTER NINETHE CONFEDERATES CHANGE THEIR BATTERY, AND ACHIEVE A REMARKABLE\nADVENTURE."

  "content": "Thunderstruck at this disappointment, the confederates held a council,\nin order to deliberate upon the next measures that should be taken; and\nFerdinand, for the present, despairing of accomplishing his grand aim,\nresolved to profit in another manner, by the conveniency of his\nsituation. He represented to his helpmate, that it would be prudent for\nthem to make hay while the sun shone, as their connexion might be\nsooner or later discovered, and an end put to all those opportunities\nwhich they now so happily enjoyed. All principles of morality had been\nalready excluded from their former plan; consequently he found it an\neasy task to interest Teresa in any other scheme tending to their\nmutual advantage, howsoever wicked and perfidious it might be. He\ntherefore persuaded her to be his auxiliary in defrauding Mademoiselle\nat play, and gave her suitable directions for that purpose; and even\ntutored her how to abuse the trust reposed in her, by embezzling the\nyoung lady’s effects, without incurring the suspicion of dishonesty.On the supposition that every servant in the house was not able to\nresist such temptation, the purse of her mistress, to which the maid\nhad always access, was dropped in a passage which the domestics had\noccasion to frequent; and Fathom posted himself in a convenient place,\nin order to observe the effect of his stratagem. Here he was not\ndisappointed in his conjecture. The first person who chanced to pass\nthat way, was one of the chambermaids, with whom Teresa had lived for\nsome time in a state of inveterate enmity, because the wench had failed\nin that homage and respect which was paid to her by the rest of the\nservants.Ferdinand had, in his heart, espoused the quarrel of his associate, and\nlonged for an occasion to deliver her from the malicious observance of\nsuch an antagonist. When he, therefore, saw her approach, his heart\nthrobbed with joyful expectations; but, when she snatched up the purse,\nand thrust it in her bosom, with all the eagerness and confusion of one\ndetermined to appropriate the windfall to her own use, his transports\nwere altogether unspeakable. He traced her to her own apartment,\nwhither she immediately retreated with great trepidation, and then\ncommunicated the discovery to Teresa, together with instructions how to\nbehave in the sequel."

The young lady,\nhaving rummaged her pockets in vain, expressed some surprise at the\nloss of her purse; upon which her attendant gave indications of extreme\namazement and concern. She said, it could not possibly be lost;\nentreated her to search her escritoir, while she herself ran about the\nroom, prying into every corner, with all the symptoms of fear and\ndistraction. Having made this unsuccessful inquiry, she pretended to\nshed a flood of tears, bewailing her own fate, in being near the person\nof any lady who met with such a misfortune, by which, she observed, her\ncharacter might be called in question. She produced her own keys, and\nbegged upon her knees, that her chamber and boxes might be searched\nwithout delay.In a word, she demeaned herself so artfully upon this occasion, that\nher mistress, who never entertained the least doubt of her integrity,\nnow looked upon her as a miracle of fidelity and attachment, and was at\ninfinite pains to console her for the accident which had happened;\nprotesting that, for her own part, the loss of the money should never\naffect her with a moment’s uneasiness, if she could retrieve a certain\nmedal which she had long kept in her purse, as a remembrance of her\ndeceased aunt, from whom she received it in a present.Fathom entered accidentally into the midst of this well-acted scene,\nand, perceiving the agitation of the maid, and the concern of the\nmistress, desired, in a respectful manner, to know the cause of their\ndisorder. Before the young lady had time to make him acquainted with\nthe circumstances of the case, his accomplice exclaimed, in an affected\npassion, “Mr. Fathom, my lady has lost her purse; and, as no persons in\nthe family are so much about her as you and I, you must give me leave,\nin my own justification, to insist upon Mademoiselle’s ordering the\napartments of us both to be searched without loss of time. Here are my\npockets and my keys, and you cannot scruple to give her the same\nsatisfaction; for innocence has nothing to fear.”Miss Melvil reprimanded her sharply for her unmannerly zeal; and\nFerdinand eyeing her with a look of disdain, “Madam,” said he, “I\napprove of your proposal; but, before I undergo such mortification, I\nwould advise Mademoiselle to subject the two chambermaids to such\ninquiry; as they also have access to the apartments, and are, I\napprehend, as likely as you or I to behave in such a scandalous\nmanner.”"

  "content": "The young lady declared that she was too well satisfied of Teresa’s\nhonesty and Ferdinand’s honour, to harbour the least suspicion of\neither, and that she would sooner die than disgrace them so far as to\ncomply with the proposal the former had made; but as she saw no reason\nfor exempting the inferior servants from that examination which Fathom\nadvised, she would forthwith put it in execution. The chambermaids\nbeing accordingly summoned, she calmly asked if either of them had\naccidentally found the purse she had dropped? and both replying in the\nnegative, she assumed an air of severity and determination, and\ndemanding their keys, threatened to examine their trunks on the\ninstant.The guilty Abigail, who, though an Hungarian, was not inferior, in\npoint of effrontery, to any one of the sisterhood in England, no sooner\nheard this menace, than she affected an air of affronted innocence,\nthanked God she had lived in many reputable families, and been trusted\nwith untold gold, but was never before suspected of theft; that the\nother maid might do as she should think proper, and be mean-spirited\nenough to let her things be tumbled topsy-turvy and exposed; but, for\nher own part, if she should be used in that inhuman and disgraceful\nmanner, she would not stay another hour in the house; and in conclusion\nsaid, that Mademoiselle had more reason to look sharp after those who\nenjoyed the greatest share of her favour, than believe their malicious\ninsinuations against innocent people whom they were well known to hate\nand defame.This declaration, implying an hint to the prejudice of Teresa, far from\ndiverting Miss Melvil from her purpose, served only to enhance the\ncharacter of the accused in her opinion, and to confirm her suspicion\nof the accuser, of whom she again demanded her keys, protesting that,\nshould she prove refractory, the Count himself should take cognisance\nof the affair, whereas, if she would deal ingenuously, she should have\nno cause to repent of her confession. So saying, she desired our\nadventurer to take the trouble of calling up some of the men-servants;\nupon which the conscious criminal began to tremble, and, falling upon\nher knees, acknowledged her guilt, and implored the forgiveness of her\nyoung mistress."

This adventure\nfully answered all the purposes of our politician; it established the\nopinion of his fellow-labourer’s virtue, beyond the power of accident\nor information to shake, and set up a false beacon to mislead the\nsentiments of Mademoiselle, in case she should for the future meet with\nthe like misfortune.CHAPTER TENTHEY PROCEED TO LEVY CONTRIBUTIONS WITH GREAT SUCCESS, UNTIL OUR HERO\nSETS OUT WITH THE YOUNG COUNT FOR VIENNA, WHERE HE ENTERS INTO LEAGUE\nWITH ANOTHER ADVENTURER.Under this secure cover, Teresa levied contributions upon her mistress\nwith great success. Some trinket was missing every day; the young\nlady’s patience began to fail; the faithful attendant was overwhelmed\nwith consternation, and, with the appearance of extreme chagrin,\ndemanded her dismission, affirming that these things were certainly\neffected by some person in the family, with a view of murdering her\nprecious reputation. Miss Melvil, not without difficulty, quieted her\nvexation with assurances of inviolable confidence and esteem, until a\npair of diamond earrings vanished, when Teresa could no longer keep her\naffliction within bounds. Indeed, this was an event of more consequence\nthan all the rest which had happened, for the jewels were valued at\nfive hundred florins."

She asked, if her daughter had reason to suspect any\nindividual in the family, and if she was perfectly confident of her own\nwoman’s integrity? Upon which Mademoiselle, with many encomiums on the\nfidelity and attachment of Teresa, recounted the adventure of the\nchambermaid, who immediately underwent a strict inquiry, and was even\ncommitted to prison, on the strength of her former misdemeanour. Our\nadventurer’s mate insisted upon undergoing the same trial with the rest\nof the domestics, and, as usual, comprehended Fathom in her\ninsinuations; while he seconded the proposal, and privately counselled\nthe old lady to introduce Teresa to the magistrate of the place. By\nthese preconcerted recriminations, they escaped all suspicion of\ncollusion. After a fruitless inquiry, the prisoner was discharged from\nher confinement, and turned out of the service of the Count, in whose\nprivate opinion the character of no person suffered so much, as that of\nhis own son, whom he suspected of having embezzled the jewels, for the\nuse of a certain inamorata, who, at that time, was said to have\ncaptivated his affections.The old gentleman felt upon this occasion all that internal anguish\nwhich a man of honour may be supposed to suffer, on account of a son’s\ndegeneracy; and, without divulging his sentiments, or even hinting his\nsuspicions to the youth himself, determined to detach him at once from\nsuch dangerous connexions, by sending him forthwith to Vienna, on\npretence of finishing his exercises at the academy, and ushering him\ninto acquaintance with the great world. Though he would not be thought\nby the young gentleman himself to harbour the least doubt of his\nmorals, he did not scruple to unbosom himself on that subject to\nFerdinand, whose sagacity and virtue he held in great veneration. This\nindulgent patron expressed himself in the most pathetic terms, on the\nuntoward disposition of his son; he told Fathom, that he should\naccompany Renaldo (that was the youth’s name) not only as a companion,\nbut a preceptor and pattern; conjured him to assist his tutor in\nsuperintending his conduct, and to reinforce the governor’s precepts by\nhis own example; to inculcate upon him the most delicate punctilios of\nhonour, and decoy him into extravagance, rather than leave the least\nilliberal sentiment in his heart."

While preparations were making for\ntheir departure, our hero held a council with his associate, whom he\nenriched with many sage instructions touching her future operations; he\nat the same time disburdened her of all or the greatest part of the\nspoils she had won, and after having received divers marks of bounty\nfrom the Count and his lady, together with a purse from his young\nmistress, he set out for Vienna, in the eighteenth year of his age,\nwith Renaldo and his governor, who were provided with letters of\nrecommendation to some of the Count’s friends belonging to the Imperial\ncourt.Such a favourable introduction could not fail of being advantageous to\na youth of Ferdinand’s specious accomplishments; for he was considered\nas the young Count’s companion, admitted into his parties, and included\nin all the entertainments to which Renaldo was invited. He soon\ndistinguished himself by his activity and address, in the course of\nthose exercises that were taught at the academy of which he was pupil;\nhis manners were so engaging as to attract the acquaintance of his\nfellow-students, and his conversation being sprightly and inoffensive,\ngrew into very great request; in a word, he and the young Count formed\na remarkable contrast, which, in the eye of the world, redounded to his\nadvantage.They were certainly, in all respects, the reverse of each other.\nRenaldo, under a total defect of exterior cultivation, possessed a most\nexcellent understanding, with every virtue that dignifies the human\nheart; while the other, beneath a most agreeable outside, with an\ninaptitude and aversion to letters, concealed an amazing fund of\nvillany and ingratitude. Hitherto his observation had been confined to\na narrow sphere, and his reflections, though surprisingly just and\nacute, had not attained to that maturity which age and experience give;\nbut now, his perceptions began to be more distinct, and extended to a\nthousand objects which had never before come under his cognisance."

Among the principal figures of life, he observed few or no\ncharacters that did not bear a strong analogy to the savage tyrants of\nthe wood. One resembled a tiger in fury and rapaciousness; a second\nprowled about like an hungry wolf, seeking whom he might devour; a\nthird acted the part of a jackal, in beating the bush for game to his\nvoracious employer; and the fourth imitated the wily fox, in practising\na thousand crafty ambuscades for the destruction of the ignorant and\nunwary. This last was the department of life for which he found himself\nbest qualified by nature and inclination; and he accordingly resolved\nthat his talent should not rust in his possession. He was already\npretty well versed in all the sciences of play; but he had every day\noccasion to see these arts carried to such a surprising pitch of\nfinesse and dexterity, as discouraged him from building his schemes on\nthat foundation.He therefore determined to fascinate the judgment, rather than the eyes\nof his fellow-creatures, by a continual exercise of that gift of\ndeceiving, with which he knew himself endued to an unrivalled degree;\nand to acquire unbounded influence with those who might be subservient\nto his interest, by an assiduous application to their prevailing\npassions. Not that play was altogether left out in the projection of\nhis economy.— Though he engaged himself very little in the executive\npart of gaming, he had not been long in Vienna, when he entered into\nleague with a genius of that kind, whom he distinguished among the\npupils of the academy, and who indeed had taken up his habitation in\nthat place with a view to pillage the provincials on their first\narrival in town, before they could be armed with proper circumspection\nto preserve their money, or have time to dispose of it in any other\nshape.Similar characters naturally attract each other, and people of our\nhero’s principles are, of all others, the most apt to distinguish their\nown likeness wheresoever it occurs; because they always keep the\nfaculty of discerning in full exertion. It was in consequence of this\nmutual alertness, that Ferdinand and the stranger, who was a native of\nTyrol, perceived themselves reflected in the dispositions of each\nother, and immediately entered into an offensive and defensive\nalliance; our adventurer undertaking for the articles of intelligence,\ncountenance, and counsel, and his associate charging himself with the\nrisk of execution.CHAPTER ELEVENFATHOM MAKES VARIOUS EFFORTS IN THE WORLD OF GALLANTRY."

Renaldo being one night intoxicated in the\ncourse of a merry-making with his fellow-pupils, from which Fathom had\npurposely absented himself, was by the Tyrolese so artfully provoked to\nplay, that he could not resist the temptation, but engaged at passdice\nwith that fell adversary, who, in less than an hour, stripped him of a\npretty round sum. Next day, when the young gentleman recovered the use\nof his reflection, he was sensibly chagrined at the folly and\nprecipitation of his own conduct, an account of which he communicated\nin confidence to our hero, with demonstrations of infinite shame and\nconcern.Ferdinand, having moralised upon the subject with great sagacity, and\nsharply inveighed against the Tyrolese, for the unfair advantage he had\ntaken, retired to his closet, and wrote the following billet, which was\nimmediately sent to his ally:—“The obligations I owe, and the attachments I feel, to the Count de\nMelvil, will not suffer me to be an idle spectator of the wrongs\noffered to his son, in the dishonourable use, I understand, you made\nlast night of his unguarded hours. I therefore insist upon your making\nimmediate restitution of the booty which you so unjustly got; otherwise\nI expect you will meet me upon the ramparts, near the bastion de la\nPort Neuve, to-morrow morning at daybreak, in order to justify, with\nyour sword, the finesse you have practised upon the friend of FERDINAND\nDE FATHOM.”The gamester no sooner received this intimation, than, according to the\nplan which had been preconcerted betwixt the author and him, he went to\nthe apartment of Renaldo, and presenting the sum of money which he had\ndefrauded him of the preceding night, told him, with a stern\ncountenance, that, though it was a just acquisition, he scorned to\navail himself of his good fortune against any person who entertained\nthe smallest doubt of his honour."

Upon which, the other produced Ferdinand’s billet, and\nthreatened, in very high terms, to meet the stripling according to his\ninvitation, and chastise him severely for his presumption. The\nconsequence of this explanation is obvious. Renaldo, imputing the\nofficiousness of Fathom to the zeal of his friendship, interposed in\nthe quarrel, which was amicably compromised, not a little to the honour\nof our adventurer, who thus obtained an opportunity of displaying his\ncourage and integrity, without the least hazard to his person; while,\nat the same time, his confederate recommended himself to the esteem of\nthe young Count, by his spirited behaviour on this occasion; so that\nRenaldo being less shy of his company for the future, the Tyrolese had\nthe fairer opportunities to prosecute his designs upon the young\ngentleman’s purse.It would be almost superfluous to say, that these were not neglected.\nThe son of Count Melvil was not deficient in point of penetration; but\nhis whole study was at that time engrossed by the care of his\neducation, and he had sometimes recourse to play as an amusement by\nwhich he sought to unbend the severity of his attention. No wonder then\nthat he fell a prey to an artful gamester, who had been regularly\ntrained to the profession, and made it the sole study of his life;\nespecially as the Hungarian was remarkable for a warmth of temper,\nwhich a knight of the post always knows how to manage for his own\nadvantage.In the course of these operations, Fathom was a very useful\ncorrespondent. He instructed the Tyrolese in the peculiarities of\nRenaldo’s disposition, and made him acquainted with the proper seasons\nfor profiting by his dexterity. Ferdinand, for example, who, by the\nauthority derived to him from the injunctions of the old Count,\nsometimes took upon himself the office of an adviser, cunningly chose\nto counsel the son at those conjunctures when he knew him least able to\nbear such expostulation. Advice improperly administered generally acts\nin diametrical opposition to the purpose for which it is supposed to be\ngiven; at least this was the case with the young gentleman, who,\ninflamed by the reproof of such a tutor, used to obey the dictates of\nhis resentment in an immediate repetition of that conduct which our\nadventurer had taken the liberty to disapprove; and the gamester was\nalways at hand to minister unto his indignation. By these means he was\ndisencumbered of divers considerable remittances, with which his father\ncheerfully supplied him, on the supposition that they were spent with\ntaste and liberality, under the direction of our adventurer."

He attempted divers enterprises in the world of gallantry,\nconscious of his own personal qualifications, and never doubting that\nhe could insinuate himself into the good graces of some married lady\nabout court, or lay an opulent dowager under contribution. But he met\nwith an obstacle in his endeavours of this kind, which all his art was\nunable to surmount. This was no other than the obscurity of his birth,\nand the want of a title, without which no person in that country lays\nclaim to the privileges of a gentleman. Had he foreseen this\ninconvenience he might have made shift to obviate the consequences, by\nobtaining permission to appear in the character of the Count’s kinsman;\nthough, in all probability, such an expedient would not have been\nextremely agreeable to the old gentleman, who was very tenacious of the\nhonour of his family; nevertheless, his generosity might have been\nprevailed upon to indulge Fathom with such a pretext, in consideration\nof the youth’s supposed attachment, and the obligations for which he\ndeemed himself indebted to his deceased mother.True it is, Ferdinand, upon his first arrival at Vienna, had been\nadmitted into fashionable company, on the footing of Renaldo’s\ncompanion, because nobody suspected the defect of his pedigree; and\neven after a report had been circulated to the prejudice of his\nextraction, by the industry of a lacquey who attended the young Count,\nthere were not wanting many young people of distinction who still\nfavoured him with their countenance and correspondence; but he was no\nlonger invited to private families, in which only he could expect to\nprofit by his address among the ladies, and had the mortification of\nfinding himself frequently excepted from parties which were expressly\ncalculated for the entertainment of the young Count. Luckily, his\nspirit was so pliant as to sustain these slights without being much\ndejected; instead of repining at the loss of that respect which had\nbeen paid to him at first, he endeavoured, with all his might, to\npreserve the little that still remained, and resolved to translate into\na humbler sphere that gallantry which he had no longer opportunities of\ndisplaying in the world of rank and fashion.CHAPTER TWELVEHE EFFECTS A LODGMENT IN THE HOUSE OF A RICH JEWELLER."

Nor did he\nfind himself disappointed in that expectation, sanguine as it was. He\nsoon found means to be introduced to the house of a wealthy bourgeois,\nwhere every individual was charmed with his easy air and extraordinary\nqualifications. He accommodated himself surprisingly to the humours of\nthe whole family; smoked tobacco, swallowed wine, and discoursed of\nstones with the husband, who was a rich jeweller; sacrificed himself to\nthe pride and loquacity of the wife; and played upon the violin, and\nsung alternately, for the amusement of his only daughter, a buxom lass,\nnearly of his own age, the fruit of a former marriage.It was not long before Ferdinand had reason to congratulate himself on\nthe footing he had gained in this society. He had expected to find, and\nin a little time actually discovered, that mutual jealousy and rancour\nwhich almost always subsist between a daughter and her step-dame,\ninflamed with all the virulence of female emulation; for the disparity\nin their ages served only to render them the more inveterate rivals in\nthe desire of captivating the other sex. Our adventurer having\ndeliberated upon the means of converting this animosity to his own\nadvantage, saw no method for this purpose so feasible as that of making\nhis approaches to the hearts of both, by ministering to each in\nprivate, food for their reciprocal envy and malevolence; because he\nwell knew that no road lies so direct and open to a woman’s heart as\nthat of gratifying her passions of vanity and resentment.When he had an opportunity of being particular with the mother, he\nexpressed his concern for having unwittingly incurred the displeasure\nof Mademoiselle, which, he observed, was obvious in every circumstance\nof her behaviour towards him; protesting he was utterly innocent of all\nintention of offending her; and that he could not account for his\ndisgrace any other way, than by supposing she took umbrage at the\ndirection of his chief regards towards her mother-in-law, which, he\nowned, was altogether involuntary, being wholly influenced by that\nlady’s superior charms and politeness."

She very graciously consoled our gallant for the mishap of\nwhich he complained, representing Wilhelmina (that was the daughter’s\nname) as a pert, illiterate, envious baggage, of whose disgust he ought\nto make no consideration; then she recounted many instances of her own\ngenerosity to that young lady, with the returns of malice and\ningratitude she had made; and, lastly, enumerated all the imperfections\nof her person, education, and behaviour; that he might see with what\njustice the gypsy pretended to vie with those who had been\ndistinguished by the approbation and even gallantry of the best people\nin Vienna.Having thus established himself her confidant and gossip, he knew his\nnext step of promotion would necessarily be to the degree of her lover;\nand in that belief resolved to play the same game with Mademoiselle\nWilhelmina, whose complexion was very much akin to that of her\nstepmother; indeed they resembled each other too much to live upon any\nterms of friendship or even decorum. Fathom, in order to enjoy a\nprivate conversation with the young lady, never failed to repeat his\nvisit every afternoon, till at length he had the pleasure of finding\nher disengaged, the jeweller being occupied among his workmen, and his\nwife gone to assist at a lying-in.Our adventurer and the daughter had already exchanged their vows, by\nthe expressive language of the eyes; he had even declared himself in\nsome tender ejaculations which had been softly whispered in her ear,\nwhen he could snatch an opportunity of venting them unperceived; nay,\nhe had upon divers occasions gently squeezed her fair hand, on pretence\nof tuning her harpsichord, and been favoured with returns of the same\ncordial pressure; so that, instead of accosting her with the fearful\nhesitation and reserve of a timid swain, he told her, after the\nexercise of the doux-yeux, that he was come to confer with her upon a\nsubject that nearly concerned her peace; and asked if she had not\nobserved of late an evident abatement of friendship in her mother’s\nbehaviour to him, whom she had formerly treated with such marks of\nfavour and respect. Mademoiselle would not pay so ill a compliment to\nher own discernment as to say she had not perceived the alteration;\nwhich, on the contrary, she owned was extremely palpable; nor was it\ndifficult to divine the cause of such estranged looks.

In short, her heart began to thaw, and her face to hang out\nthe flag of capitulation; which was no sooner perceived by our hero,\nthan he renewed his attack with redoubled fervour, pronouncing in a\nmost vehement tone, “Light of my eyes, and empress of my soul! behold\nme prostrate at your feet, waiting with the most pious resignation, for\nthat sentence from your lips, on which my future happiness or misery\nmust altogether depend. Not with more reverence does the unhappy bashaw\nkiss the sultan’s letter that contains his doom, than I will submit to\nyour fatal determination. Speak then, angelic sweetness! for never, ah!\nnever will I rise from this suppliant posture, until I am encouraged to\nlive and hope. No! if you refuse to smile upon my passion, here shall I\nbreathe the last sighs of a despairing lover; here shall this faithful\nsword do the last office to its unfortunate master, and shed the blood\nof the truest heart that ever felt the cruel pangs of disappointed\nlove.”"

Ruin, indeed,\nshall wait upon her enemies, if such there be, and those love-lorn\nwretches who pine with anguish under her disdain. Grant me, kind\nHeaven, a more propitious boon; direct her genial regards to one whose\nlove is without example, and whose constancy is unparalleled. Bear\nwitness to my constancy and faith, ye verdant hills, ye fertile plains,\nye shady groves, ye purling streams; and if I prove untrue, ah! let me\nnever find a solitary willow or a bubbling brook, by help of which I\nmay be enabled to put a period to my wretched life.”Here this excellent actor began to sob most piteously, and the\ntender-hearted Wilhelmina, unable longer to withstand his moving tale,\nwith a repetition of the interjection, ah! gently dropped into his\narms. This was the beginning of a correspondence that soon rose to a\nvery interesting pitch; and they forthwith concerted measures for\ncarrying it on without the knowledge or suspicion of her mother-in-law.\nNevertheless, the young lady, vanquished as she was, and unskilled in\nthe ways of men, would not all at once yield at discretion; but\ninsisted upon those terms, without which no woman’s reputation can be\nsecured. Our lover, far from seeking to evade the proposal, assented to\nit in terms of uncommon satisfaction, and promised to use his whole\nindustry in finding a priest upon whose discretion they could rely;\nnay, he certainly resolved to comply with her request in good earnest,\nrather than forfeit the advantages which he foresaw in their union. His\ngood fortune, however, exempted him from the necessity of taking such a\nstep, which at best must have been disagreeable; for so many\ndifficulties occurred in the inquiry which was set on foot, and so\nartfully did Fathom in the meantime manage the influence he had already\ngained over her heart, that, before her passion could obtain a legal\ngratification, she surrendered to his wish, without any other\nassurance, than his solemn profession of sincerity and truth, on which\nshe reposed herself with the most implicit confidence and faith.CHAPTER THIRTEENHE IS EXPOSED TO A MOST PERILOUS INCIDENT IN THE COURSE OF HIS INTRIGUE\nWITH THE DAUGHTER."

All the obstacles to their mutual enjoyment being thus\nremoved, our adventurer was by his mistress indulged with an\nassignation in her own chamber, which, though contiguous to that of her\nstepmother, was provided with a door that opened into a common\nstaircase, to which he had access at all hours of the night.He did not neglect the rendezvous, but, presenting himself at the\nappointed time, which was midnight, made the signal they had agreed\nupon, and was immediately admitted by Wilhelmina, who waited for hire\nwith a lover’s impatience. Fathom was not deficient in those\nexpressions of rapture that are current on those occasions; but, on the\ncontrary, became so loud in the transports of self-congratulation, that\nhis voice reached the ears of the vigilant stepmother, who wakening the\njeweller from his first nap, gave him to understand that some person\nwas certainly in close conversation with his daughter; and exhorted him\nto rise forthwith, and vindicate the honour of his family.The German, who was naturally of a phlegmatic habit, and never went to\nbed without a full dose of the creature, which added to his\nconstitutional drowsiness, gave no ear to his wife’s intimation, until\nshe had repeated it thrice, and used other means to rouse him from the\narms of slumber. Meanwhile Fathom and his inamorata overheard her\ninformation, and our hero would have made his retreat immediately,\nthrough the port by which he entered, had not his intention been\noverruled by the remonstrances of the young lady, who observed that the\ndoor was already fast bolted, and could not possibly be opened without\ncreating a noise that would confirm the suspicion of her parents; and\nthat over and above this objection he would, in sallying from that\ndoor, run the risk of being met by her father, who in all probability\nwould present himself before it, in order to hinder our hero’s escape.\nShe therefore conveyed him softly into her closet, where she assured\nhim he might remain with great tranquillity, in full confidence that\nshe would take such measures as would effectually screen him from\ndetection."

Wilhelmina, who was already undressed, and had\npurposely extinguished the light, pretended to be suddenly waked from\nher sleep, and starting up, exclaimed in a tone of surprise and\naffright, “Jesu, Maria! what is the matter?”—“Hussy!” replied the\nGerman in a terrible accent, “open the door this instant; there is a\nman in your bedchamber, and, by the lightning and thunder! I will wash\naway the stain he has cast upon my honour with the schellum’s\nheart’s-blood.”Not at all intimidated by this boisterous threat, she admitted him\nwithout hesitation, and, with a shrillness of voice peculiar to\nherself, began to hold forth upon her own innocence and his unjust\nsuspicion, mingling in her harangue sundry oblique hints against her\nmother-in-law, importing, that some people were so viciously inclined\nby their own natures, that she did not wonder at their doubting the\nvirtue of other people; but that these people despised the insinuations\nof such people, who ought to be more circumspect in their own conduct,\nlest they themselves should suffer reprisals from those people whom\nthey had so maliciously slandered.Having uttered these flowers of rhetoric, which were calculated for the\nhearing of her step-dame, who stood with a light at her husband’s back,\nthe young lady assumed an ironical air, and admonished her father to\nsearch every corner of her apartment. She even affected to assist his\ninquiry; with her own hands pulled out a parcel of small drawers, in\nwhich her trinkets were contained; desired him to look into her\nneedlecase and thimble, and, seeing his examination fruitless,\nearnestly intreated him to rummage her closet also, saying, with a\nsneer, that, in all probability, the dishonourer would be found in that\nlurking-place. The manner in which she pretended to ridicule his\napprehensions made an impression upon the jeweller, who was very well\ndisposed to retreat into his own nest, when his wife, with a certain\nslyness in her countenance, besought him to comply with his daughter’s\nrequest, and look into that same closet, by which means Wilhelmina’s\nvirtue would obtain a complete triumph."

His agony was therefore unspeakable, when the door flew open;\nand it was not till after a considerable pause of recollection, that he\nperceived the candle extinguished by the motion of the air produced\nfrom the German’s sudden irruption. This accident, which disconcerted\nhim so much as to put a full stop to his charge, was very favourable to\nour hero, who, summoning all his presence of mind, crept up into the\nchimney, while the jeweller stood at the door, waiting for his wife’s\nreturn with another light; so that, when the closet was examined, there\nwas nothing found to justify the report which the stepmother had made;\nand the father, after having made a slight apology to Wilhelmina for\nhis intrusion, retired with his yoke-fellow into their own chamber."

Before her father and\nmother retired, she lighted her lamp, on pretence of being afraid to be\nin the dark, after the perturbation of spirits she had undergone; and\nher room was no sooner evacuated of such troublesome visitants, than\nshe secured the doors, and went in quest of her lover.Accordingly, every corner of the closet underwent a new search, and she\ncalled upon his name with a soft voice, which she thought no other\nperson would overhear. But Ferdinand did not think proper to gratify\nher impatience, because he could not judge of the predicament in which\nhe stood by the evidence of all his senses, and would not relinquish\nhis post, until he should be better certified that the coast was clear.\nMeanwhile, his Dulcinea, having performed her inquiry to no purpose,\nimagined there was something preternatural in the circumstance of his\nvanishing so unaccountably, and began to cross herself with great\ndevotion. She returned to her chamber, fixed the lamp in the fireplace,\nand, throwing herself upon the bed, gave way to the suggestions of her\nsuperstition, which were reinforced by the silence that prevailed, and\nthe gloomy glimmering of the light. She reflected upon the trespass she\nhad already committed in her heart, and, in the conjectures of her\nfear, believed that her lover was no other than the devil himself, who\nhad assumed the appearance of Fathom, in order to tempt and seduce her\nvirtue."

Upon which\nFerdinand, foreseeing that her parents would be again alarmed, would\nnot stay to undeceive her and explain himself, but, unlocking the door\nwith great expedition, ran downstairs, and luckily accomplished his\nescape. This was undoubtedly the wisest measure he could have taken;\nfor he had not performed one half of his descent toward the street,\nwhen the German was at his daughter’s bedside, demanding to know the\ncause of her exclamation. She then gave him an account of what she had\nseen, with all the exaggerations of her own fancy, and, after having\nweighed the circumstances of her story, he interpreted the apparition\ninto a thief, who had found means to open the door that communicated\nwith the stair; but, having been scared by Wilhelmina’s shriek, had\nbeen obliged to retreat before he could execute his purpose.Our hero’s spirits were so wofully disturbed by this adventure, that,\nfor a whole week, he felt no inclination to visit his inamorata, and\nwas not without apprehension that the affair had terminated in an\nexplanation very little to his advantage.
