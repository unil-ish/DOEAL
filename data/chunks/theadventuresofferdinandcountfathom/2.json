  "content": "He had formerly imagined, but was now fully persuaded, that the sons of\nmen preyed upon one another, and such was the end and condition of\ntheir being. Among the principal figures of life, he observed few or no\ncharacters that did not bear a strong analogy to the savage tyrants of\nthe wood. One resembled a tiger in fury and rapaciousness; a second\nprowled about like an hungry wolf, seeking whom he might devour; a\nthird acted the part of a jackal, in beating the bush for game to his\nvoracious employer; and the fourth imitated the wily fox, in practising\na thousand crafty ambuscades for the destruction of the ignorant and\nunwary. This last was the department of life for which he found himself\nbest qualified by nature and inclination; and he accordingly resolved\nthat his talent should not rust in his possession. He was already\npretty well versed in all the sciences of play; but he had every day\noccasion to see these arts carried to such a surprising pitch of\nfinesse and dexterity, as discouraged him from building his schemes on\nthat foundation.He therefore determined to fascinate the judgment, rather than the eyes\nof his fellow-creatures, by a continual exercise of that gift of\ndeceiving, with which he knew himself endued to an unrivalled degree;\nand to acquire unbounded influence with those who might be subservient\nto his interest, by an assiduous application to their prevailing\npassions. Not that play was altogether left out in the projection of\nhis economy.— Though he engaged himself very little in the executive\npart of gaming, he had not been long in Vienna, when he entered into\nleague with a genius of that kind, whom he distinguished among the\npupils of the academy, and who indeed had taken up his habitation in\nthat place with a view to pillage the provincials on their first\narrival in town, before they could be armed with proper circumspection\nto preserve their money, or have time to dispose of it in any other\nshape.Similar characters naturally attract each other, and people of our\nhero’s principles are, of all others, the most apt to distinguish their\nown likeness wheresoever it occurs; because they always keep the\nfaculty of discerning in full exertion. It was in consequence of this\nmutual alertness, that Ferdinand and the stranger, who was a native of\nTyrol, perceived themselves reflected in the dispositions of each\nother, and immediately entered into an offensive and defensive\nalliance; our adventurer undertaking for the articles of intelligence,\ncountenance, and counsel, and his associate charging himself with the\nrisk of execution.CHAPTER ELEVENFATHOM MAKES VARIOUS EFFORTS IN THE WORLD OF GALLANTRY."

  "content": "Thus connected, they began to hunt in couples; and Fathom, in order to\nprofit by the alliance with a good grace, contrived a small scheme that\nsucceeded to his wish. Renaldo being one night intoxicated in the\ncourse of a merry-making with his fellow-pupils, from which Fathom had\npurposely absented himself, was by the Tyrolese so artfully provoked to\nplay, that he could not resist the temptation, but engaged at passdice\nwith that fell adversary, who, in less than an hour, stripped him of a\npretty round sum. Next day, when the young gentleman recovered the use\nof his reflection, he was sensibly chagrined at the folly and\nprecipitation of his own conduct, an account of which he communicated\nin confidence to our hero, with demonstrations of infinite shame and\nconcern.Ferdinand, having moralised upon the subject with great sagacity, and\nsharply inveighed against the Tyrolese, for the unfair advantage he had\ntaken, retired to his closet, and wrote the following billet, which was\nimmediately sent to his ally:—“The obligations I owe, and the attachments I feel, to the Count de\nMelvil, will not suffer me to be an idle spectator of the wrongs\noffered to his son, in the dishonourable use, I understand, you made\nlast night of his unguarded hours. I therefore insist upon your making\nimmediate restitution of the booty which you so unjustly got; otherwise\nI expect you will meet me upon the ramparts, near the bastion de la\nPort Neuve, to-morrow morning at daybreak, in order to justify, with\nyour sword, the finesse you have practised upon the friend of FERDINAND\nDE FATHOM.”The gamester no sooner received this intimation, than, according to the\nplan which had been preconcerted betwixt the author and him, he went to\nthe apartment of Renaldo, and presenting the sum of money which he had\ndefrauded him of the preceding night, told him, with a stern\ncountenance, that, though it was a just acquisition, he scorned to\navail himself of his good fortune against any person who entertained\nthe smallest doubt of his honour."

  "content": "The young Count, surprised at this address, rejected his offer with\ndisdain, and desired to know the meaning of such an unexpected\ndeclaration. Upon which, the other produced Ferdinand’s billet, and\nthreatened, in very high terms, to meet the stripling according to his\ninvitation, and chastise him severely for his presumption. The\nconsequence of this explanation is obvious. Renaldo, imputing the\nofficiousness of Fathom to the zeal of his friendship, interposed in\nthe quarrel, which was amicably compromised, not a little to the honour\nof our adventurer, who thus obtained an opportunity of displaying his\ncourage and integrity, without the least hazard to his person; while,\nat the same time, his confederate recommended himself to the esteem of\nthe young Count, by his spirited behaviour on this occasion; so that\nRenaldo being less shy of his company for the future, the Tyrolese had\nthe fairer opportunities to prosecute his designs upon the young\ngentleman’s purse.It would be almost superfluous to say, that these were not neglected.\nThe son of Count Melvil was not deficient in point of penetration; but\nhis whole study was at that time engrossed by the care of his\neducation, and he had sometimes recourse to play as an amusement by\nwhich he sought to unbend the severity of his attention. No wonder then\nthat he fell a prey to an artful gamester, who had been regularly\ntrained to the profession, and made it the sole study of his life;\nespecially as the Hungarian was remarkable for a warmth of temper,\nwhich a knight of the post always knows how to manage for his own\nadvantage.In the course of these operations, Fathom was a very useful\ncorrespondent. He instructed the Tyrolese in the peculiarities of\nRenaldo’s disposition, and made him acquainted with the proper seasons\nfor profiting by his dexterity. Ferdinand, for example, who, by the\nauthority derived to him from the injunctions of the old Count,\nsometimes took upon himself the office of an adviser, cunningly chose\nto counsel the son at those conjunctures when he knew him least able to\nbear such expostulation. Advice improperly administered generally acts\nin diametrical opposition to the purpose for which it is supposed to be\ngiven; at least this was the case with the young gentleman, who,\ninflamed by the reproof of such a tutor, used to obey the dictates of\nhis resentment in an immediate repetition of that conduct which our\nadventurer had taken the liberty to disapprove; and the gamester was\nalways at hand to minister unto his indignation. By these means he was\ndisencumbered of divers considerable remittances, with which his father\ncheerfully supplied him, on the supposition that they were spent with\ntaste and liberality, under the direction of our adventurer."

  "content": "But Ferdinand’s views were not confined to the narrow field of this\nalliance. He attempted divers enterprises in the world of gallantry,\nconscious of his own personal qualifications, and never doubting that\nhe could insinuate himself into the good graces of some married lady\nabout court, or lay an opulent dowager under contribution. But he met\nwith an obstacle in his endeavours of this kind, which all his art was\nunable to surmount. This was no other than the obscurity of his birth,\nand the want of a title, without which no person in that country lays\nclaim to the privileges of a gentleman. Had he foreseen this\ninconvenience he might have made shift to obviate the consequences, by\nobtaining permission to appear in the character of the Count’s kinsman;\nthough, in all probability, such an expedient would not have been\nextremely agreeable to the old gentleman, who was very tenacious of the\nhonour of his family; nevertheless, his generosity might have been\nprevailed upon to indulge Fathom with such a pretext, in consideration\nof the youth’s supposed attachment, and the obligations for which he\ndeemed himself indebted to his deceased mother.True it is, Ferdinand, upon his first arrival at Vienna, had been\nadmitted into fashionable company, on the footing of Renaldo’s\ncompanion, because nobody suspected the defect of his pedigree; and\neven after a report had been circulated to the prejudice of his\nextraction, by the industry of a lacquey who attended the young Count,\nthere were not wanting many young people of distinction who still\nfavoured him with their countenance and correspondence; but he was no\nlonger invited to private families, in which only he could expect to\nprofit by his address among the ladies, and had the mortification of\nfinding himself frequently excepted from parties which were expressly\ncalculated for the entertainment of the young Count. Luckily, his\nspirit was so pliant as to sustain these slights without being much\ndejected; instead of repining at the loss of that respect which had\nbeen paid to him at first, he endeavoured, with all his might, to\npreserve the little that still remained, and resolved to translate into\na humbler sphere that gallantry which he had no longer opportunities of\ndisplaying in the world of rank and fashion.CHAPTER TWELVEHE EFFECTS A LODGMENT IN THE HOUSE OF A RICH JEWELLER."

  "content": "In consequence of this determination, he to the uttermost exerted his\ngood-humour among the few friends of consequence his fortune had left,\nand even carried his complaisance so far as to become the humble\nservant of their pleasures, while he attempted to extend his\nacquaintance in an inferior path of life, where he thought his talents\nwould shine more conspicuous than at the assemblies of the great, and\nconduce more effectually to the interest of all his designs. Nor did he\nfind himself disappointed in that expectation, sanguine as it was. He\nsoon found means to be introduced to the house of a wealthy bourgeois,\nwhere every individual was charmed with his easy air and extraordinary\nqualifications. He accommodated himself surprisingly to the humours of\nthe whole family; smoked tobacco, swallowed wine, and discoursed of\nstones with the husband, who was a rich jeweller; sacrificed himself to\nthe pride and loquacity of the wife; and played upon the violin, and\nsung alternately, for the amusement of his only daughter, a buxom lass,\nnearly of his own age, the fruit of a former marriage.It was not long before Ferdinand had reason to congratulate himself on\nthe footing he had gained in this society. He had expected to find, and\nin a little time actually discovered, that mutual jealousy and rancour\nwhich almost always subsist between a daughter and her step-dame,\ninflamed with all the virulence of female emulation; for the disparity\nin their ages served only to render them the more inveterate rivals in\nthe desire of captivating the other sex. Our adventurer having\ndeliberated upon the means of converting this animosity to his own\nadvantage, saw no method for this purpose so feasible as that of making\nhis approaches to the hearts of both, by ministering to each in\nprivate, food for their reciprocal envy and malevolence; because he\nwell knew that no road lies so direct and open to a woman’s heart as\nthat of gratifying her passions of vanity and resentment.When he had an opportunity of being particular with the mother, he\nexpressed his concern for having unwittingly incurred the displeasure\nof Mademoiselle, which, he observed, was obvious in every circumstance\nof her behaviour towards him; protesting he was utterly innocent of all\nintention of offending her; and that he could not account for his\ndisgrace any other way, than by supposing she took umbrage at the\ndirection of his chief regards towards her mother-in-law, which, he\nowned, was altogether involuntary, being wholly influenced by that\nlady’s superior charms and politeness."

She very graciously consoled our gallant for the mishap of\nwhich he complained, representing Wilhelmina (that was the daughter’s\nname) as a pert, illiterate, envious baggage, of whose disgust he ought\nto make no consideration; then she recounted many instances of her own\ngenerosity to that young lady, with the returns of malice and\ningratitude she had made; and, lastly, enumerated all the imperfections\nof her person, education, and behaviour; that he might see with what\njustice the gypsy pretended to vie with those who had been\ndistinguished by the approbation and even gallantry of the best people\nin Vienna.Having thus established himself her confidant and gossip, he knew his\nnext step of promotion would necessarily be to the degree of her lover;\nand in that belief resolved to play the same game with Mademoiselle\nWilhelmina, whose complexion was very much akin to that of her\nstepmother; indeed they resembled each other too much to live upon any\nterms of friendship or even decorum. Fathom, in order to enjoy a\nprivate conversation with the young lady, never failed to repeat his\nvisit every afternoon, till at length he had the pleasure of finding\nher disengaged, the jeweller being occupied among his workmen, and his\nwife gone to assist at a lying-in.Our adventurer and the daughter had already exchanged their vows, by\nthe expressive language of the eyes; he had even declared himself in\nsome tender ejaculations which had been softly whispered in her ear,\nwhen he could snatch an opportunity of venting them unperceived; nay,\nhe had upon divers occasions gently squeezed her fair hand, on pretence\nof tuning her harpsichord, and been favoured with returns of the same\ncordial pressure; so that, instead of accosting her with the fearful\nhesitation and reserve of a timid swain, he told her, after the\nexercise of the doux-yeux, that he was come to confer with her upon a\nsubject that nearly concerned her peace; and asked if she had not\nobserved of late an evident abatement of friendship in her mother’s\nbehaviour to him, whom she had formerly treated with such marks of\nfavour and respect. Mademoiselle would not pay so ill a compliment to\nher own discernment as to say she had not perceived the alteration;\nwhich, on the contrary, she owned was extremely palpable; nor was it\ndifficult to divine the cause of such estranged looks. This remark was\naccompanied with an irresistible glance; she smiled enchanting, the\ncolour deepened on her cheeks, her breast began to heave, and her whole\nframe underwent a most agreeable confusion."

She\nhath, in spite of all my circumspection, perceived that passion which\nit is not in my power to conceal, and in consequence of which I now\ndeclare myself your devoted adorer; or, conscious of your superior\nexcellence, her jealousy hath taken the alarm, and, though stung with\nconjecture only, repines at the triumph of your perfections. How far\nthis spirit of malignity may be inflamed to my prejudice, I know not.\nPerhaps, as this is the first, it may be also the last opportunity I\nshall have of avowing the dearest sentiments of my heart to the fair\nobject that inspired them; in a word, I may be for ever excluded from\nyour presence. Excuse me, then, divine creature! from the practice of\nthose unnecessary forms, which I should take pride in observing, were I\nindulged with the ordinary privileges of an honourable lover; and, once\nfor all, accept the homage of an heart overflowing with love and\nadmiration. Yes, adorable Wilhelmina! I am dazzled with your\nsupernatural beauty; your other accomplishments strike me with wonder\nand awe. I am enchanted by the graces of your deportment, ravished with\nthe charms of your conversation; and there is a certain tenderness of\nbenevolence in that endearing aspect, which, I trust, will not fail to\nmelt with sympathy at the emotions of a faithful slave like me.”So saying, he threw himself upon his knees, and, seizing her plump\nhand, pressed it to his lips with all the violence of real transport.\nThe nymph, whose passions nature had filled to the brim, could not hear\nsuch a rhapsody unmoved. Being an utter stranger to addresses of this\nkind, she understood every word of it in the literal acceptation; she\nbelieved implicitly in the truth of the encomiums he had bestowed, and\nthought it reasonable he should be rewarded for the justice he had done\nto her qualifications, which had hitherto been almost altogether\noverlooked. In short, her heart began to thaw, and her face to hang out\nthe flag of capitulation; which was no sooner perceived by our hero,\nthan he renewed his attack with redoubled fervour, pronouncing in a\nmost vehement tone, “Light of my eyes, and empress of my soul! behold\nme prostrate at your feet, waiting with the most pious resignation, for\nthat sentence from your lips, on which my future happiness or misery\nmust altogether depend. Not with more reverence does the unhappy bashaw\nkiss the sultan’s letter that contains his doom, than I will submit to\nyour fatal determination. Speak then, angelic sweetness! for never, ah!\nnever will I rise from this suppliant posture, until I am encouraged to\nlive and hope. No! if you refuse to smile upon my passion, here shall I\nbreathe the last sighs of a despairing lover; here shall this faithful\nsword do the last office to its unfortunate master, and shed the blood\nof the truest heart that ever felt the cruel pangs of disappointed\nlove.”"

Ruin, indeed,\nshall wait upon her enemies, if such there be, and those love-lorn\nwretches who pine with anguish under her disdain.

This was the beginning of a correspondence that soon rose to a\nvery interesting pitch; and they forthwith concerted measures for\ncarrying it on without the knowledge or suspicion of her mother-in-law.\nNevertheless, the young lady, vanquished as she was, and unskilled in\nthe ways of men, would not all at once yield at discretion; but\ninsisted upon those terms, without which no woman’s reputation can be\nsecured. Our lover, far from seeking to evade the proposal, assented to\nit in terms of uncommon satisfaction, and promised to use his whole\nindustry in finding a priest upon whose discretion they could rely;\nnay, he certainly resolved to comply with her request in good earnest,\nrather than forfeit the advantages which he foresaw in their union. His\ngood fortune, however, exempted him from the necessity of taking such a\nstep, which at best must have been disagreeable; for so many\ndifficulties occurred in the inquiry which was set on foot, and so\nartfully did Fathom in the meantime manage the influence he had already\ngained over her heart, that, before her passion could obtain a legal\ngratification, she surrendered to his wish, without any other\nassurance, than his solemn profession of sincerity and truth, on which\nshe reposed herself with the most implicit confidence and faith.CHAPTER THIRTEENHE IS EXPOSED TO A MOST PERILOUS INCIDENT IN THE COURSE OF HIS INTRIGUE\nWITH THE DAUGHTER."

All the obstacles to their mutual enjoyment being thus\nremoved, our adventurer was by his mistress indulged with an\nassignation in her own chamber, which, though contiguous to that of her\nstepmother, was provided with a door that opened into a common\nstaircase, to which he had access at all hours of the night.He did not neglect the rendezvous, but, presenting himself at the\nappointed time, which was midnight, made the signal they had agreed\nupon, and was immediately admitted by Wilhelmina, who waited for hire\nwith a lover’s impatience. Fathom was not deficient in those\nexpressions of rapture that are current on those occasions; but, on the\ncontrary, became so loud in the transports of self-congratulation, that\nhis voice reached the ears of the vigilant stepmother, who wakening the\njeweller from his first nap, gave him to understand that some person\nwas certainly in close conversation with his daughter; and exhorted him\nto rise forthwith, and vindicate the honour of his family.The German, who was naturally of a phlegmatic habit, and never went to\nbed without a full dose of the creature, which added to his\nconstitutional drowsiness, gave no ear to his wife’s intimation, until\nshe had repeated it thrice, and used other means to rouse him from the\narms of slumber. Meanwhile Fathom and his inamorata overheard her\ninformation, and our hero would have made his retreat immediately,\nthrough the port by which he entered, had not his intention been\noverruled by the remonstrances of the young lady, who observed that the\ndoor was already fast bolted, and could not possibly be opened without\ncreating a noise that would confirm the suspicion of her parents; and\nthat over and above this objection he would, in sallying from that\ndoor, run the risk of being met by her father, who in all probability\nwould present himself before it, in order to hinder our hero’s escape.\nShe therefore conveyed him softly into her closet, where she assured\nhim he might remain with great tranquillity, in full confidence that\nshe would take such measures as would effectually screen him from\ndetection."

Wilhelmina, who was already undressed, and had\npurposely extinguished the light, pretended to be suddenly waked from\nher sleep, and starting up, exclaimed in a tone of surprise and\naffright, “Jesu, Maria! what is the matter?”—“Hussy!” replied the\nGerman in a terrible accent, “open the door this instant; there is a\nman in your bedchamber, and, by the lightning and thunder! I will wash\naway the stain he has cast upon my honour with the schellum’s\nheart’s-blood.”Not at all intimidated by this boisterous threat, she admitted him\nwithout hesitation, and, with a shrillness of voice peculiar to\nherself, began to hold forth upon her own innocence and his unjust\nsuspicion, mingling in her harangue sundry oblique hints against her\nmother-in-law, importing, that some people were so viciously inclined\nby their own natures, that she did not wonder at their doubting the\nvirtue of other people; but that these people despised the insinuations\nof such people, who ought to be more circumspect in their own conduct,\nlest they themselves should suffer reprisals from those people whom\nthey had so maliciously slandered.Having uttered these flowers of rhetoric, which were calculated for the\nhearing of her step-dame, who stood with a light at her husband’s back,\nthe young lady assumed an ironical air, and admonished her father to\nsearch every corner of her apartment. She even affected to assist his\ninquiry; with her own hands pulled out a parcel of small drawers, in\nwhich her trinkets were contained; desired him to look into her\nneedlecase and thimble, and, seeing his examination fruitless,\nearnestly intreated him to rummage her closet also, saying, with a\nsneer, that, in all probability, the dishonourer would be found in that\nlurking-place. The manner in which she pretended to ridicule his\napprehensions made an impression upon the jeweller, who was very well\ndisposed to retreat into his own nest, when his wife, with a certain\nslyness in her countenance, besought him to comply with his daughter’s\nrequest, and look into that same closet, by which means Wilhelmina’s\nvirtue would obtain a complete triumph."

This was undoubtedly the wisest measure he could have taken;\nfor he had not performed one half of his descent toward the street,\nwhen the German was at his daughter’s bedside, demanding to know the\ncause of her exclamation. She then gave him an account of what she had\nseen, with all the exaggerations of her own fancy, and, after having\nweighed the circumstances of her story, he interpreted the apparition\ninto a thief, who had found means to open the door that communicated\nwith the stair; but, having been scared by Wilhelmina’s shriek, had\nbeen obliged to retreat before he could execute his purpose.Our hero’s spirits were so wofully disturbed by this adventure, that,\nfor a whole week, he felt no inclination to visit his inamorata, and\nwas not without apprehension that the affair had terminated in an\nexplanation very little to his advantage. He was, however, delivered\nfrom this disagreeable suspense, by an accidental meeting with the\njeweller himself, who kindly chid him for his long absence, and\nentertained him in the street with an account of the alarm which his\nfamily had sustained, by a thief who broke into Wilhelmina’s apartment.\nGlad to find his apprehension mistaken, he renewed his correspondence\nwith the family, and, in a little time, found reason to console himself\nfor the jeopardy and panic he had undergone.CHAPTER FOURTEENHE IS REDUCED TO A DREADFUL DILEMMA, IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN ASSIGNATION\nWITH THE WIFE.Nor was his whole care and attention engrossed by the execution of this\nscheme upon the daughter. While he managed his concerns in that quarter\nwith incredible ardour and application, he was not the less\nindefatigable in the prosecution of his design upon the mother-in-law,\nwhich he forwarded with all his art during those opportunities he\nenjoyed in the absence of Wilhelmina, who was frequently called away by\nthe domestic duties of the house. The passions of the jeweller’s wife\nwere in such a state of exaltation, as exempted our hero from the\nrepulses and fatigue attending a long siege."

In a word, matters were quickly\nbrought to such a mutual understanding, that, one evening, while they\namused themselves at lansquenet, Fathom conjured her to give him the\nrendezvous next day at the house of any third person of her own sex, in\nwhose discretion she could confide; and, after a few affected scruples\non her side, which he well knew how to surmount, she complied with his\nrequest, and the circumstances of the appointment were settled\naccordingly. After this treaty, their satisfaction rose to such a\nwarmth, and the conversation became so reciprocally endearing, that our\ngallant expressed his impatience of waiting so long for the\naccomplishment of his wishes, and, with the most eager transport,\nbegged she would, if possible, curtail the term of his expectation,\nthat his brain might not suffer by his standing so many tedious hours\non the giddy verge of rapture.The dame, who was naturally compassionate, sympathised with his\ncondition, and, unable to resist his pathetic supplications, gave him\nto understand that his desire could not be granted, without subjecting\nthem both to some hazard, but that she was disposed to run any risk in\nbehalf of his happiness and peace. After this affectionate preamble,\nshe told him that her husband was then engaged in a quarterly meeting\nof the jewellers, from whence he never failed to return quite\noverwhelmed with wine, tobacco, and the phlegm of his own constitution;\nso that he would fall fast asleep as soon as his head should touch the\npillow, and she be at liberty to entertain the lover without\ninterruption, provided he could find means to deceive the jealous\nvigilance of Wilhelmina, and conceal himself in some corner of the\nhouse, unsuspected and unperceived.Our lover, remembering his adventure with the daughter, would have\nwillingly dispensed with this expedient, and began to repent of the\neagerness with which he had preferred his solicitation; but, seeing\nthere was now no opportunity of retracting with honour, he affected to\nenter heartily into the conversation, and, after much canvassing, it\nwas determined, that, while Wilhelmina was employed in the kitchen, the\nmother should conduct our adventurer to the outer door, where he should\npay the compliment of parting, so as to be overheard by the young lady;\nbut, in the meantime, glide softly into the jeweller’s bedchamber,\nwhich was a place they imagined least liable to the effects of a\ndaughter’s prying disposition, and conceal himself in a large press or\nwardrobe, that stood in one corner of the apartment. The scene was\nimmediately acted with great success, and our hero cooped up in his\ncage, where he waited so long, that his desires began to subside, and\nhis imagination to aggravate the danger of his situation."

What if his frenzy should prompt him\nto search his wife’s chamber for gallants? this would certainly be the\nfirst place to which he would direct his inquiry; or, granting this\nsupposition chimerical, I may be seized with an irresistible\ninclination to cough, before he is oppressed with sleep; he may be\nwaked by the noise I shall make in disengaging myself from this\nembarrassed situation; and, finally, I may find it impracticable to\nretire unseen or unheard, after everything else shall have succeeded to\nmy wish.”These suggestions did not at all contribute to the quiet of our\nadventurer, who, having waited three whole hours in the most\nuncomfortable suspense, heard the jeweller brought into the room in\nthat very condition which his fears had prognosticated. He had, it\nseems, quarrelled over his cups with another tradesman, and received a\nsalutation on the forehead with a candlestick, which not only left an\nignominious and painful mark upon his countenance, but even disordered\nhis brain to a very dangerous degree of delirium; so that, instead of\nallowing himself quietly to be undressed and put to bed by his wife, he\nanswered all her gentle admonitions and caresses with the most\nopprobrious invectives and obstreperous behaviour; and, though he did\nnot tax her with infidelity to his bed, he virulently accused her of\nextravagance and want of economy; observed, her expensive way of living\nwould bring him to a morsel of bread; and unfortunately recollecting\nthe attempt of the supposed thief, started up from his chair, swearing\nby G—’s mother that he would forthwith arm himself with a brace of\npistols, and search every apartment in the house. “That press,” said\nhe, with great vociferation, “may, for aught I know, be the receptacle\nof some ruffian.”"

This address made such an impression upon\nour adventurer, that he had well-nigh obeyed the summons, and burst\nfrom his concealment, in a desperate effort to escape, without being\nrecognised by the intoxicated German; and indeed, had the application\nbeen repeated, he in all likelihood would have tried the experiment,\nfor by this time his terrors had waxed too strong to be much longer\nsuppressed. From this hazardous enterprise he was, however, exempted by\na lucky accident that happened to his disturber, whose head chancing to\npitch upon the corner of a chair in his fall, he was immediately lulled\ninto a trance, during which the considerate lady, guessing the disorder\nof her gallant, and dreading further interruption, very prudently\nreleased him from his confinement, after she had put out the light, and\nin the dark conveyed him to the door, where he was comforted with the\npromise that she would punctually remember the rendezvous of next day.She then invoked the assistance of the servants, who, being waked for\nthe purpose, lifted up their master, and tumbled him into bed, while\nFerdinand hied him home in an universal sweat, blessing himself from\nany future achievement of that sort in a house where he had been twice\nin such imminent danger of life and reputation. Nevertheless, he did\nnot fail to honour the assignation, and avail himself of the\ndisposition his mistress manifested to make him all the recompense in\nher power for the disappointment and chagrin which he had undergone.CHAPTER FIFTEENBUT AT LENGTH SUCCEEDS IN HIS ATTEMPT UPON BOTH.Having thus gained a complete victory over the affections of these two\nladies, he began to convert his good fortune to the purposes of that\nprinciple, from which his view was never, no, not for a moment,\ndetached. In other words, he used them as ministers and purveyors to\nhis avarice and fraud. As for the mother-in-law, she was of herself so\nliberal as to anticipate the wishes of any moderate adventurer, and\npresented him with sundry valuable jewels, as memorials of her esteem;\nnor was the daughter backward in such expressions of regard; she\nalready considered his interest as her own, and took frequent\nopportunities of secreting for his benefit certain stray trinkets that\nshe happened to pick up in her excursions within doors."

Yet, not contented with what he\nthus could earn, and despairing of being able to steer the bark of his\nfortune for any length of time between two such dangerous quicksands,\nhe resolved to profit by the occasion while it lasted, and strike some\nconsiderable stroke at once. A plan was formed in consequence of this\ndetermination, and, at an appointment with the mother in the house of\ntheir female friend, our adventurer appeared with an air of dejection,\nwhich he veiled with a thin cover of forced pleasantry, that his\nmistress might suppose he endeavoured to conceal some mortal chagrin\nthat preyed upon his heart.The stratagem succeeded to his wish. She observed his countenance\nbetween whiles overcast, took notice of the involuntary sighs he\nheaved; and, with the most tender expressions of sympathy, conjured him\nto make her acquainted with the cause of his affliction. Instead of\ngratifying her request immediately, he evaded her questions with a\nrespectful reserve, implying, that his love would not suffer him to\nmake her a partner in his sorrow; and this delicacy on his part whetted\nher impatience and concern to such a degree, that, rather than keep her\nin such an agony of doubt and apprehension, he was prevailed upon to\ntell her, that he had been, the preceding night, engaged with a company\nof his fellow-students, where he had made too free with the champagne,\nso that his caution forsook him, and he had been decoyed into play by a\nTyrolese gamester, who stripped him of all his ready money, and\nobtained from him an obligation for two hundred florins, which he could\nnot possibly pay without having recourse to his relation the Count de\nMelvil, who would have just cause to be incensed at his extravagance.This information he concluded, by declaring that, cost what it would,\nhe was resolved to make a candid confession of the truth, and throw\nhimself entirely upon the generosity of his patron, who could inflict\nno other punishment than that of discarding him from his favour and\nprotection,—a misfortune which, how grievous soever it might be, he\nshould be able to sustain with fortitude, could he fall upon some\nmethod of satisfying the Tyrolese, who was very importunate and savage\nin his demand. His kind mistress no sooner found out the source of his\ninquietude, than she promised to dry it up, assuring him that next day,\nat the same hour, she would enable him to discharge the debt; so that\nhe might set his heart at ease, and recollect that gaiety which was the\nsoul of her enjoyment."

The attachment I have the honour\nto profess for your amiable person, is not founded on such inglorious\nmotives, but is the genuine result of that generous passion which none\nbut the noble-minded feel, and the only circumstance of this misfortune\nthat I dread to encounter, is the necessity of withdrawing myself for\never from the presence of her whose genial smiles could animate my soul\nagainst all the persecution of adverse fortune.”This declamation, accompanied with a profound sigh, served only to\ninflame her desire of extricating him from the difficulty in which he\nwas involved. She exhausted all her eloquence in attempting to persuade\nhim that his refusal was an outrage against her affection. He pretended\nto refute her arguments, and remained unshaken by all the power of her\nsolicitations, until she had recourse to the most passionate\nremonstrances of love, and fell at his feet in the posture of a forlorn\nshepherdess. What he refused to her reason, he granted to her tears,\nbecause his heart was melted by her affliction, and next day\ncondescended to accept of her money, out of pure regard to her\nhappiness and peace.Encouraged by the success of this achievement, he resolved to practise\nthe same experiment upon Wilhelmina, in hope of extracting an equal\nshare of profit from her simplicity and attachment, and, at their very\nnext nocturnal rendezvous in her chamber, reacted the farce already\nrehearsed, with a small variation, which he thought necessary to\nstimulate the young lady in his behalf. He rightly concluded, that she\nwas by no means mistress of such a considerable sum as he had already\nextorted from her mother, and therefore thought proper to represent\nhimself in the most urgent predicament, that her apprehension, on his\naccount, might be so alarmed as to engage her in some enterprise for\nhis advantage, which otherwise she would never have dreamed of\nundertaking. With this view, after having described his own calamitous\nsituation, in consequence of her pressing entreaties, which he affected\nto evade, he gave her to understand, that there was no person upon\nearth to whom he would have recourse in this emergency; for which\nreason he was determined to rid himself of all his cares at once, upon\nthe friendly point of his own faithful sword."

Her grief manifested itself in a flood of tears,\nwhile she hung round his neck, conjuring him in the most melting terms,\nby their mutual love, in which they had been so happy, to lay aside\nthat fatal determination, which would infallibly involve her in the\nsame fate; for, she took Heaven to witness, that she would not one\nmoment survive the knowledge of his death.He was not deficient in expressions of reciprocal regard. He extolled\nher love and tenderness with a most extravagant eulogium, and seemed\nwrung with mortal anguish at the prospect of parting for ever from his\nlovely Wilhelmina; but his honour was a stern and rigid creditor, that\ncould not be appeased, except with his blood; and all the boon she\ncould obtain, by dint of the most woful supplication, was a promise to\ndefer the execution of his baleful purpose for the space of\nfour-and-twenty hours, during which she hoped Heaven would\ncompassionate her sufferings, and inspire her with some contrivance for\ntheir mutual relief. Thus he yielded to her fervent request, rather\nwith a view to calm the present transports of her sorrow, than with any\nexpectation of seeing himself redeemed from his fate by her\ninterposition; such at least were his professions when he took his\nleave, assuring her, that he would not quit his being before he should\nhave devoted a few hours to another interview with the dear object of\nhis love.Having thus kindled the train, he did not doubt that the mine of his\ncraft would take effect, and repaired to his own lodging, in full\npersuasion of seeing his aim accomplished, before the time fixed for\ntheir last assignation.
