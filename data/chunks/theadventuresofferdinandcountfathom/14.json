  "content": "These ill offices, however, far from answering her purpose, had a quite\ncontrary effect. For, in consequence of her invectives, he was, in a\nfew days, called to the wife of a merchant, who piously hoped, that his\npractice would not give Miss Biddy the lie. The patient had long\nlingered under a complication of distempers, and being in no immediate\ndanger of her life, Doctor Fathom was in no hurry to strike a decisive\nstroke; till the husband growing impatient of delay, and so explicit in\nhis hints, that it was impossible to misapprehend his meaning, our\nadventurer resolved to do something effectual for his satisfaction, and\nprescribed a medicine of such rough operation, as he thought must\neither oblige his employer, or produce a change in the lady’s\nconstitution, that would make a noise in the world, and bring a new\naccession to his fame.Proceeding upon these maxims, he could not be disappointed. The remedy\nplayed its part with such violence, as reduced the patient to\nextremity, and the merchant had actually bespoke an undertaker; when,\nafter a series of swoonings and convulsions, nature so far prevailed,\nas to expel, at once, the prescription and the disease; yet the\ngood-natured husband was so much affected with the agonies to which he\nsaw the wife of his bosom exposed by this specific, that, although the\neffect of it was her perfect recovery, he could never bear the sight of\nFathom for the future, nor even hear his name mentioned, without giving\nsigns of horror and indignation. Nay, he did not scruple to affirm,\nthat, had our adventurer been endowed with the least tincture of\nhumanity, he would have suffered the poor woman to depart in peace,\nrather than restore her to health, at the expense of such anxiety and\ntorture."

  "content": "On the other hand, this extraordinary cure was blazoned abroad by the\ngood lady and her gossips, with such exaggerations as roused the\nastonishment of the public, and concurred with the report of his last\nmiscarriage to bring him upon the carpet, as the universal subject of\ndiscourse. When a physician becomes the town talk, he generally\nconcludes his business more than half done, even though his fame should\nwholly turn upon his malpractice; insomuch that some members of the\nfaculty have been heard to complain, that they never had the good\nfortune to be publicly accused of homicide; and it is well known, that\na certain famous empiric, of our day, never flourished to any degree of\nwealth and reputation till after he had been attacked in print, and\nfairly convicted of having destroyed a good number of the human\nspecies. Success raised upon such a foundation would, by a disciple of\nPlato, and some modern moralists, be ascribed to the innate virtue and\ngenerosity of the human heart, which naturally espouses the cause that\nneeds protection. But I, whose notions of human excellence are not\nquite so sublime, am apt to believe it is owing to that spirit of\nself-conceit and contradiction, which is, at least, as universal, if\nnot as natural, as the moral sense so warmly contended for by those\nideal philosophers.The most infamous wretch often finds his account in these principles of\nmalevolence and self-love. For wheresoever his character falls under\ndiscussion there is generally some person present, who, either from an\naffectation of singularity, or envy to the accusers, undertakes his\ndefence, and endeavours to invalidate the articles of his impeachment,\nuntil he is heated by altercation, and hurried into more effectual\nmeasures for his advantage. If such benefits accrue to those who have\nno real merit to depend upon, surely our hero could not but reap\nsomething extraordinary from the debates to which he now gave rise; as,\nby the miraculous cure he had affected, all his patient’s friends, all\nthe enemies of her husband, all those who envied his other adversary,\nwere interested in his behalf, exclusive of such admirers as surprise\nand curiosity might engage in his cause."

  "content": "Thus wafted upon the wings of applause, his fame soon diffused itself\ninto all the corners of this great capital. The newspapers teemed with\nhis praise; and in order to keep up the attention of the public, his\nemissaries, male and female, separated into different coffee-houses,\ncompanies, and clubs, where they did not fail to comment upon these\narticles of intelligence. Such a favourable incident is, of itself,\nsufficient to float the bark of a man’s fortune. He was, in a few days,\ncalled to another lady, labouring under the same disorder he had so\nsuccessfully dispelled, and she thought herself benefited by his\nadvice. His acquaintance naturally extended itself among the visitants\nand allies of his patients; he was recommended from family to family;\nthe fees began to multiply; a variety of footmen appeared every day at\nhis door; he discontinued his sham circuit, and looking upon the\npresent conjuncture, as that tide in his affairs, which, according to\nShakespeare, when taken at the full, leads on to fortune, he resolved\nthat the opportunity should not be lost, and applied himself with such\nassiduity to his practice, that, in all likelihood, he would have\ncarried the palm from all his contemporaries, had he not split upon the\nsame rock which had shipwrecked his hopes before.We have formerly descanted upon that venereal appetite which glowed in\nthe constitution of our adventurer, and with all his philosophy and\ncaution could hardly keep within bounds. The reader, therefore, will\nnot be much surprised to learn, that, in the exercise of his\nprofession, he contracted an intimacy with a clergyman’s wife, whom he\nattended as a physician, and whose conjugal virtue he subdued by a long\nand diligent exertion of his delusive arts, while her mind was\nenervated by sickness, and her husband abroad upon his necessary\noccasions. This unhappy patient, who was a woman of an agreeable person\nand lively conversation, fell a sacrifice to her own security and\nself-conceit; her want of health had confined her to a sedentary life,\nand her imagination being active and restless, she had spent those\nhours in reading which other young women devote to company and\ndiversion, but, as her studies were not superintended by any person of\ntaste, she had indulged her own fancy without method or propriety. The\nSpectator taught her to be a critic and philosopher; from plays she\nlearned poetry and wit, and derived her knowledge of life from books of\nhistory and adventures. Fraught with these acquisitions, and furnished\nby nature with uncommon vivacity, she despised her own sex, and courted\nthe society of men, among whom she thought her talents might be more\nhonourably displayed, fully confident of her own virtue and sagacity,\nwhich enabled her to set all their arts at defiance."

She was no less pleased with his obliging manners than with his\nphysic, and found much entertainment in his conversation, so that the\nacquaintance proceeded to a degree of intimacy, during which he\nperceived her weak side, and being enamoured of her person, flattered\nher out of all her caution. The privilege of his character furnished\nhim with opportunities to lay snares for her virtue, and, taking\nadvantage of that listlessness, languor, and indolence of the spirits,\nby which all the vigilance of the soul is relaxed, he, after a long\ncourse of attention and perseverance, found means to make shipwreck of\nher peace.Though he mastered her chastity, he could not quiet her conscience,\nwhich incessantly upbraided her with breach of the marriage vow; nor\ndid her undoer escape without a share of the reproaches suggested by\nher penitence and remorse. This internal anxiety co-operating with her\ndisease, and perhaps with the medicines he prescribed, reduced her to\nthe brink of the grave; when her husband returned from a neighbouring\nkingdom, in consequence of her earnest request, joined to the\ninformation of her friends, who had written to him an account of the\nextremity in which she was. The good man was afflicted beyond measure\nwhen he saw himself upon the verge of losing a wife whom he had always\ntenderly loved; but what were his emotions, when she, taking the first\nopportunity of his being alone with her, accosted him to this effect:"

  "content": "“I am now hastening towards that dissolution from which no mortal is\nexempted, and though the prospect of futurity is altogether clouded and\nuncertain, my conscience will not allow me to plunge into eternity\nwithout unburdening my mind, and, by an ingenuous confession, making\nall the atonement in my power for the ingratitude I have been guilty\nof, and the wrongs I have committed against a virtuous husband, who\nnever gave me cause of complaint. You stand amazed at this preamble,\nbut alas! how will you be shocked when I own that I have betrayed you\nin your absence, that I have trespassed against God and my marriage\nvow, and fallen from the pride and confidence of virtue to the most\nabject state of vice; yes, I have been unfaithful to your bed, having\nfallen a victim to the infernal insinuations of a villain, who took\nadvantage of my weak and unguarded moments. Fathom is the wretch who\nhath thus injured your honour, and ruined my unsuspecting innocence. I\nhave nothing to plead in alleviation of my crime but the most sincere\ncontrition of heart, and though, at any other juncture, I could not\nexpect your forgiveness, yet, as I now touch the goal of life, I trust\nin your humanity and benevolence for that pardon which will lighten the\nsorrows of my soul, and those prayers which I hope will entitle me to\nfavour at the throne of grace.”The poor husband was so much overwhelmed with grief and confusion at\nthis unexpected address that he could not recollect himself till after\na pause of several minutes, when uttering a hollow groan, “I will not,”\nsaid he, “aggravate your sufferings, by reproaching you with my wrongs,\nthough your conduct hath been but an ill return for all my tenderness\nand esteem. I look upon it as a trial of my Christian patience, and\nbear my misfortune with resignation; meanwhile, I forgive you from my\nheart, and fervently pray that your repentance may be acceptable to the\nFather of Mercy.” So saying, he approached her bedside, and embraced\nher in token of his sincerity. Whether this generous condescension\ndiffused such a composure upon her spirits as tended to the ease and\nrefreshment of nature, which had been almost exhausted by disease and\nvexation, certain it is, that from this day she began to struggle with\nher malady in surprising efforts, and hourly gained ground, until her\nhealth was pretty well re-established."

  "content": "This recovery was so far beyond the husband’s expectation, that he\nbegan to make very serious reflections on the event, and even to wish\nhe had not been quite so precipitate in pardoning the backslidings of\nhis wife; for, though he could not withhold his compassion from a dying\npenitent, he did not at all relish the thoughts of cohabiting, as\nusual, with a wife self-convicted of the violation of the matrimonial\ncontract; he therefore considered his declaration as no more than a\nprovisional pardon, to take place on condition of her immediate death,\nand, in a little time, not only communicated to her his sentiments on\nthis subject, but also separated himself from her company, secured the\nevidence of her maid, who had been confidant in her amour with Fathom,\nand immediately set on foot a prosecution against our adventurer, whose\nbehaviour to his wife he did not fail to promulgate, with all its\naggravating circumstances. By these means the doctor’s name became so\nnotorious that every man was afraid of admitting him into his house,\nand every woman ashamed of soliciting his advice.CHAPTER FIFTY-FOURHIS ECLIPSE, AND GRADUAL DECLINATION.Misfortunes seldom come single; upon the back of this hue and cry he\nunluckily prescribed phlebotomy to a gentleman of some rank, who\nchanced to expire during the operation, and quarrelled with his\nlandlord the apothecary, who charged him with having forgot the good\noffices he had done him in the beginning of his career, and desired he\nwould provide himself with another lodging.All these mishaps, treading upon the heels of one another, had a very\nmortifying effect upon his practice. At every tea-table his name was\noccasionally put to the torture, with that of the vile creature whom he\nhad seduced, though it was generally taken for granted by all those\nfemale casuists, that she must have made the first advances, for it\ncould not be supposed that any man would take much trouble in laying\nschemes for the ruin of a person whose attractions were so slender,\nespecially considering the ill state of her health, a circumstance that\nseldom adds to a woman’s beauty or good-humour; besides, she was always\na pert minx, that affected singularity, and a masculine manner of\nspeaking, and many of them had foreseen that she would, some time or\nother, bring herself into such a premunire. At all gossipings, where\nthe apothecary or his wife assisted, Fathom’s pride, ingratitude, and\nmalpractice were canvassed; in all clubs of married men he was\nmentioned with marks of abhorrence and detestation, and every medical\ncoffee-house rung with his reproach. Instances of his ignorance and\npresumption were quoted, and many particulars feigned for the purpose\nof defamation, so that our hero was exactly in the situation of a\nhorseman, who, in riding at full speed for the plate, is thrown from\nthe saddle in the middle of the race, and left without sense or motion\nupon the plain."

Both these funds, however, failed\nin a very little time, his lawsuit was a gulf that swallowed up all his\nready money, and the gleanings of his practice were scarce sufficient\nto answer his pocket expenses, which now increased in proportion to the\ndecrease of business, for, as he had more idle time, and was less\nadmitted into private families, so he thought he had more occasion to\nenlarge his acquaintance among his own sex, who alone were able to\nsupport him in his disgrace with the other. He accordingly listed\nhimself in several clubs, and endeavoured to monopolise the venereal\nbranch of trade, though this was but an indifferent resource, for\nalmost all his patients of this class were such as either could not, or\nwould not, properly recompense the physician.For some time he lingered in this situation, without going upwards or\ndownwards, floating like a wisp of straw at the turning of the tide,\nuntil he could no longer amuse the person of whom he had hired his\ncoach-horses, or postpone the other demands, which multiplied upon him\nevery day. Then was his chariot overturned with a hideous crash, and\nhis face so much wounded with the shivers of the glass, which went to\npieces in the fall, that he appeared in the coffee-house with half a\ndozen black patches upon his countenance, gave a most circumstantial\ndetail of the risk he had run, and declared, that he did not believe he\nshould ever hazard himself again in any sort of wheel carriage."

  "content": "Soon after this accident, he took an opportunity of telling his\nfriends, in the same public place, that he had turned away his footman\non account of his drunkenness, and was resolved, for the future, to\nkeep none but maids in his service, because the menservants are\ngenerally impudent, lazy, debauched, or dishonest; and after all,\nneither so neat, handy, or agreeable as the other sex. In the rear of\nthis resolution, he shifted his lodgings into a private court, being\ndistracted with the din of carriages, that disturb the inhabitants who\nlive towards the open street; and gave his acquaintance to understand,\nthat he had a medical work upon the anvil, which he could not finish\nwithout being indulged in silence and tranquillity. In effect, he\ngradually put on the exteriors of an author. His watch, with an\nhorizontal movement by Graham, which he had often mentioned, and shown\nas a very curious piece of workmanship, began, about this time, to be\nvery much out of order, and was committed to the care of a mender, who\nwas in no hurry to restore it. His tie-wig degenerated into a major; he\nsometimes appeared without a sword, and was even observed in public\nwith a second day’s shirt. At last, his clothes became rusty; and when\nhe walked about the streets, his head turned round in a surprising\nmanner, by an involuntary motion in his neck, which he had contracted\nby a habit of reconnoitring the ground, that he might avoid all\ndangerous or disagreeable encounters.Fathom, finding himself descending the hill of fortune with an acquired\ngravitation, strove to catch at every twig, in order to stop or retard\nhis descent. He now regretted the opportunities he had neglected, of\nmarrying one of several women of moderate fortune, who had made\nadvances to him in the zenith of his reputation; and endeavoured, by\nforcing himself into a lower path of life than any he had hitherto\ntrod, to keep himself afloat, with the portion of some tradesman’s\ndaughter, whom he meant to espouse. While he exerted himself in this\npursuit, he happened, in returning from a place about thirty miles from\nLondon, to become acquainted, in the stage-coach, with a young woman of\na very homely appearance, whom, from the driver’s information, he\nunderstood to be the niece of a country justice, and daughter of a\nsoap-boiler, who had lived and died in London, and left her, in her\ninfancy, sole heiress of his effects, which amounted to four thousand\npounds. The uncle, who was her guardian, had kept her sacred from the\nknowledge of the world, resolving to effect a match betwixt her and his\nown son; and it was with much difficulty he had consented to this\njourney, which she had undertaken as a visit to her own mother, who had\nmarried a second husband in town."

  "content": "Fraught with these anecdotes, Fathom began to put forth his gallantry\nand good-humour, and, in a word, was admitted by the lady to the\nprivilege of an acquaintance, in which capacity he visited her during\nthe term of her residence in London; and, as there was no time to be\nlost, declared his honourable intentions. He had such a manifest\nadvantage, in point of personal accomplishments, over the young\ngentleman who was destined for her husband, that she did not disdain\nhis proposals; and, before she set out for the country, he had made\nsuch progress in her heart, that the day was actually fixed for their\nnuptials, on which he faithfully promised to carry her off in a coach\nand six. How to raise money for this expedition was all the difficulty\nthat remained; for, by this time, his finances were utterly dried up,\nand his credit altogether exhausted. Upon a very pressing occasion, he\nhad formerly applied himself to a certain wealthy quack, who had\nrelieved his necessities by lending him a small sum of money, in return\nfor having communicated to him a secret medicine, which he affirmed to\nbe the most admirable specific that ever was invented. The nostrum had\nbeen used, and, luckily for him, succeeded in the trial; so that the\nempiric, in the midst of his satisfaction, began to reflect, that this\nsame Fathom, who pretended to be in possession of a great many\nremedies, equally efficacious, would certainly become a formidable\nrival to him in his business, should he ever be able to extricate\nhimself from his present difficulties.In consequence of these suggestions, he resolved to keep our\nadventurer’s head under water, by maintaining him in the most abject\ndependence. Accordingly he had, from time to time, accommodated him\nwith small trifles, which barely served to support his existence, and\neven for these had taken notes of hand, that he might have a scourge\nover his head, in case he should prove insolent or refractory. To this\nbenefactor Fathom applied for a reinforcement of twenty guineas, which\nhe solicited with the more confidence, as that sum would certainly\nenable him to repay all other obligations. The quack would advance the\nmoney upon no other condition, than that of knowing the scheme, which\nbeing explained, he complied with Ferdinand’s request; but, at the same\ntime, privately despatched an express to the young lady’s uncle, with a\nfull account of the whole conspiracy; so that, when the doctor arrived\nat the inn, according to appointment, he was received by his worship in\nperson, who gave him to understand, that his niece had changed her\nmind, and gone fifty miles farther into the country to visit a\nrelation. This was a grievous disappointment to Fathom, who really\nbelieved his mistress had forsaken him through mere levity and caprice,\nand was not undeceived till several months after her marriage with her\ncousin, when, at an accidental meeting in London, she explained the\nstory of the secret intelligence, and excused her marriage, as the\neffect of rigorous usage and compulsion."

His passion was of a different\nnature, and the object of it effectually without his reach. With regard\nto his appetite for women, as it was an infirmity of his constitution,\nwhich he could not overcome, and as he was in no condition to gratify\nit at a great expense, he had of late chosen a housekeeper from the\nhundreds of Drury, and, to avoid scandal, allowed her to assume his\nname. As to the intimation which had been sent to the country justice,\nhe immediately imputed it to the true author, whom he marked for his\nvengeance accordingly; but, in the meantime, suppressed his resentment,\nbecause he in some measure depended upon him for subsistence. On the\nother hand, the quack, dreading the forwardness and plausibility of our\nhero, which might, one time or other, render him independent, put a\nstop to those supplies, on pretence of finding them inconvenient; but,\nout of his friendship and goodwill to Fathom, undertook to procure for\nhim such letters of recommendation as would infallibly make his fortune\nin the West Indies, and even to set him out in a genteel manner for the\nvoyage. Ferdinand perceived his drift, and thanked him for his generous\noffer, which he would not fail to consider with all due deliberation;\nthough he was determined against the proposal, but obliged to\ntemporise, that he might not incur the displeasure of this man, at\nwhose mercy he lay. Meanwhile the prosecution against him in Doctors’\nCommons drew near a period, and the lawyers were clamorous for money,\nwithout which, he foresaw he should lose the advantage which his cause\nhad lately acquired by the death of his antagonist’s chief evidence; he\ntherefore, seeing every other channel shut up, began to doubt, whether\nthe risk of being apprehended or slain in the character of a\nhighwayman, was not overbalanced by the prospect of being acquitted of\na charge which had ruined his reputation and fortune, and actually\nentertained thoughts of taking the air on Hounslow Heath, when he was\ndiverted from this expedient by a very singular adventure."

Nor was this infirmity originally produced from\nindigence, inasmuch as her circumstances had been always affluent, and\nshe was now possessed of a considerable sum of money in the funds;\nnotwithstanding which, the avarice of her nature tempted her to let\nlodgings, though few people could live under the same roof with such an\noriginal, who, rather than be idle, had often filched pieces of her own\nplate, and charged her servants with the theft, or hinted suspicion of\nher lodgers. Fathom, struck with the description, soon perceived how\nthis woman’s disease might be converted to his advantage; and after\nhaving obtained sufficient intelligence, on pretence of satisfying his\ncuriosity, he visited the widow, in consequence of a bill at her door,\nand actually hired an apartment in her house, whither he forthwith\nrepaired with his inamorata."

He fed her distemper with divers\ninconsiderable trinkets, such as copper medals, corkscrews, odd\nbuckles, and a paltry seal set in silver, which were, at different\ntimes, laid as baits for her infirmity, and always conveyed away with\nremarkable eagerness, which he and his Dulcinea took pleasure in\nobserving from an unsuspected place. Thus confirmed in his opinion, he,\nat length, took an opportunity of exposing a metal watch that belonged\nto his mistress, and saw it seized with great satisfaction, in the\nabsence of his helpmate, who had gone abroad on purpose. According to\ninstruction, she soon returned, and began to raise a terrible clamour\nabout the loss of her watch; upon which she was condoled by her\nlandlady, who seemed to doubt the integrity of the maid, and even\nproposed that Mrs. Fathom should apply to some justice of the peace for\na warrant to search the servant’s trunk. The lady thanked her for the\ngood advice, in compliance with which she had immediate recourse to a\nmagistrate, who granted a search warrant, not against the maid, but the\nmistress; and she, in a little time, returned with the constable at her\nback.These precautions being taken, Doctor Fathom desired a private\nconference with the old gentlewoman, in which he gave her to\nunderstand, that he had undoubted proofs of her having secreted, not\nonly the watch, but also several other odd things of less consequence,\nwhich he lost since his residence in her house. He then showed the\nwarrant he had obtained against her, and asked if she had anything to\noffer why the constable should not do his duty? Inexpressible were the\nanguish and confusion of the defendant, when she found herself thus\nentrapped, and reflected, that she was on the point of being detected\nof felony; for she at once concluded, that the snare was laid for her,\nand knew that the officer of justice would certainly find the unlucky\nwatch in one of the drawers of her scrutoire.Tortured with these suggestions, afraid of public disgrace, and\ndreading the consequence of legal conviction, she fell on her knees\nbefore the injured Fathom, and, after having imputed her crime to the\ntemptations of necessity, implored his compassion, promised to restore\nthe watch, and everything she had taken, and begged he would dismiss\nthe constable, that her reputation might not suffer in the eye of the\nworld."

After much argumentation, he consented to accept of double the\nsum, which being instantly paid in East India bonds, Doctor Fathom told\nthe constable, that the watch was found; and for once her reputation\nwas patched up. This seasonable supply enabled our hero to stand trial\nwith his adversary, who was nonsuited, and also to mend his external\nappearance, which of late had not been extremely magnificent.Soon after this gleam of good fortune, a tradesman, to whom he was\nconsiderably indebted, seeing no other probable means to recover his\nmoney, introduced Fathom to the acquaintance of a young widow who\nlodged at his house, and was said to be in possession of a considerable\nfortune. Considering the steps that were taken, it would have been\nalmost impossible for him to miscarry in his addresses. The lady had\nbeen bred in the country, was unacquainted with the world, and of a\nvery sanguine disposition, which her short trial of matrimony had not\nserved to cool. Our adventurer was instructed to call at the\ntradesman’s house, as if by accident, at an appointed time, when the\nwidow was drinking tea with her landlady. On these occasions he always\nbehaved to admiration. She liked his person, and praised his\npoliteness, good-humour, and good sense; his confederates extolled him\nas a prodigy of learning, taste, and good-nature; they likewise\nrepresented him as a person on the eve of eclipsing all his competitors\nin physic. An acquaintance and intimacy soon ensued, nor was he\nrestricted in point of opportunity. In a word, he succeeded in his\nendeavours, and, one evening, on pretence of attending her to the play,\nhe accompanied her to the Fleet, where they were married, in presence\nof the tradesman and his wife, who were of the party."

  "content": "This grand affair being accomplished to his satisfaction, he, next day,\nvisited her brother, who was a counsellor of the Temple, to make him\nacquainted with the step his sister had taken; and though the lawyer\nwas not a little mortified to find that she had made such a clandestine\nmatch, he behaved civilly to his new brother-in-law, and gave him to\nunderstand, that his wife’s fortune consisted of a jointure of one\nhundred and fifty pounds a year, and fifteen hundred pounds bequeathed\nto her during her widowhood, by her own father, who had taken the\nprecaution of settling it in the hands of trustees, in such a manner as\nthat any husband she might afterwards espouse should be restricted from\nencroaching upon the capital, which was reserved for the benefit of her\nheirs. This intimation was far from being agreeable to our hero, who\nhad been informed, that this sum was absolutely at the lady’s disposal,\nand had actually destined the greatest part of it for the payment of\nhis debts, for defraying the expense of furnishing an elegant house,\nand setting up a new equipage.Notwithstanding this disappointment, he resolved to carry on his plan\nupon the credit of his marriage, which was published in a very pompous\narticle of the newspapers; a chariot was bespoke, a ready furnished\nhouse immediately taken, and Doctor Fathom began to reappear in all his\nformer splendour.His good friend the empiric, alarmed at this event, which not only\nraised our adventurer into the sphere of a dangerous rival, but also\nfurnished him with means to revenge the ill office he had sustained at\nhis hands on the adventure of the former match—for, by this time,\nFathom had given him some hints, importing, that he was not ignorant of\nhis treacherous behaviour—roused, I say, by these considerations, he\nemployed one of his emissaries, who had some knowledge of Fathom’s\nbrother-in-law, to prejudice him against our adventurer, whom he\nrepresented as a needy sharper, not only overwhelmed with debt and\ndisgrace, but likewise previously married to a poor woman, who was\nprevented by nothing but want from seeking redress at law. To confirm\nthese assertions, he gave him a detail of Fathom’s encumbrances, which\nhe had learned for the purpose, and even brought the counsellor into\ncompany with the person who had lived with our hero before marriage,\nand who was so much incensed at her abrupt dismission, that she did not\nscruple to corroborate these allegations of the informer."

  "content": "The lawyer, startled at this intelligence, set on foot a minute inquiry\ninto the life and conversation of the doctor, which turned out so\nlittle to the advantage of his character and circumstances, that he\nresolved, if possible, to disunite him from his family; and, as a\nprevious step, repeated to his sister all that he had heard to the\nprejudice of her husband, not forgetting to produce the evidence of his\nmistress, who laid claim to him by a prior title, which, she pretended,\ncould be proved by the testimony of the clergyman who joined them. Such\nan explanation could not fail to inflame the resentment of the injured\nwife, who, at the very first opportunity, giving a loose to the\nimpetuosity of her temper, upbraided our hero with the most bitter\ninvectives for his perfidious dealing.Ferdinand, conscious of his own innocence, which he had not always to\nplead, far from attempting to soothe her indignation, assumed the\nauthority and prerogative of a husband, and sharply reprehended her for\nher credulity and indecent warmth. This rebuke, instead of silencing,\ngave new spirit and volubility to her reproaches, in the course of\nwhich she plainly taxed him with want of honesty and affection, and\nsaid that, though his pretence was love, his aim was no other than a\nbase design upon her fortune.Fathom, stung with these accusations, which he really did not deserve,\nreplied with uncommon heat, and charged her in his turn with want of\nsincerity and candour, in the false account she had given of that same\nfortune before marriage. He even magnified his own condescension, in\nsurrendering his liberty to a woman who had so little to recommend her\nto the addresses of the other sex; a reflection which provoked this\nmild creature to such a degree of animosity, that, forgetting her duty\nand allegiance, she lent him a box on the ear with such energy as made\nhis eyes water; and he, for the honour of manhood and sovereignty,\nhaving washed her face with a dish of tea, withdrew abruptly to a\ncoffee-house in the neighbourhood, where he had not long remained, when\nhis passion subsided, and he then saw the expediency of an immediate\nreconciliation, which he resolved to purchase, even at the expense of a\nsubmission."

Smarting as he was from the\nexpense of lawsuits, he dreaded a prosecution for bigamy, which, though\nhe had justice on his side, he knew he could not of himself support.\nBesides, all his other schemes of life were frustrated by this unlucky\nelopement. He therefore speedily determined to anticipate, as much as\nin him lay, the malice of his enemies, and to obtain, without delay,\nauthentic documents of his marriage. With this view, he hastened to the\nhouse of the tradesman, who, with his wife, had been witness to the\nceremony and consummation; and, in order to interest them the more\nwarmly in his cause, made a pathetic recital of this unhappy breach, in\nwhich he had suffered such injury and insult. But all his rhetoric\nwould not avail. Mrs. Muddy had been beforehand with him, and had\nproved the better orator of the two; for she had assailed this honest\ncouple with such tropes and figures of eloquence, as were altogether\nirresistible."

Then\nthe wife, who was the common mouth upon all such occasions, contracting\nher features into a very formal disposition, “I’ll assure you,” said\nshe, “Doctor Fathom, my husband and I have been in a very great\nterrification and numplush, to hear such bad things of a person, whom,\nas one may say, we thought a worthy gentleman, and were ready to serve\nat all times, by day and by night, as the saying is. And besides, for\nall that, you know, and God knows, as we are dustrious people, and work\nhard for what we get, and we have served gentlemen to our own harm,\nwhereby my husband was last Tuesday served with a siserary, being that\nhe was bound for an officer that ran away. And I said to my husband,\nTimothy, says I, ’tis a very hard thing for one to ruin one’s self for\nstranger people—There’s Doctor Fathom, says I, his account comes to\nnine-and-forty pounds seven shillings and fourpence halfpenny; and you\nknow, doctor, that was before your last bill began. But, howsomever,\nlittle did I think, as how a gentleman of your learning would go to\ndeceive a poor gentlewoman, when you had another wife alive.”In vain did our adventurer endeavour to vindicate himself from this\naspersion; the good woman, like a great many modern disputants,\nproceeded with her declamation, without seeming to hear what was said\non the other side of the question; and the husband was altogether\nneutral. At length, Ferdinand, finding all his protestations\nineffectual, “Well,” said he, “though you are resolved, I see, to\ndiscredit all that I can say in opposition to that scandalous slander,\nof which I can easily acquit myself in a court of justice, surely you\nwill not refuse to grant me a certificate, signifying that you were\npresent at the ceremony of my marriage with this unhappy woman.” “You\nshall excuse us,” replied the female orator; “people cannot be too wary\nin signing their names in this wicked world; many a one has been\nbrought to ruination by signing his name, and my husband shall not,\nwith my goodwill, draw himself into such a primmineery.”Fathom, alarmed at this refusal, earnestly argued against the\ninhumanity and injustice of it, appealing to their own consciences for\nthe reasonableness of his proposal; but, from the evasive answers of\nthe wife, he had reason to believe, that, long before the time of\ntrial, they would take care to have forgotten the whole transaction.Though he was equally confounded and incensed at this instance of their\nperfidy, he durst not manifest his indignation, conscious of the\nadvantage they had over him in divers respects; but repaired, without\nloss of time, to the lodging of the clergyman who had noosed him,\nresolved to consult his register, and secure his evidence. Here too his\nevil genius had got the start of him; for the worthy ecclesiastic not\nonly could not recollect his features, or find his name in the\nregister, but, when importuned by his pressing remonstrances, took\numbrage at the freedom of his behaviour, and threatened, if he would\nnot immediately take himself away, to raise the posse of the Fleet, for\nthe safety of his own person."

But, alas! he met with such a reception as he had reason\nto expect from a slighted woman, who had never felt any real attachment\nfor his person. She did not upbraid him with his cruelty in leaving her\nas a mistress, but, with a species of effrontery never enough to be\nadmired, reproached him with his villany, in abandoning her, who was\nhis true and lawful wife, to go and ruin a poor gentlewoman, by whose\nfortune he had been allured.When he attempted to expostulate with this virago, upon the barbarity\nof this assertion, she very prudently declined engaging in private\nconversation with such an artful and wicked man; and, calling up the\npeople of the house, insisted upon his being conducted to the door.CHAPTER FIFTY-SIXIN WHICH HIS FORTUNE IS EFFECTUALLY STRANGLED.The last resource, and that upon which he least depended, was the\nadvice and assistance of his old friend the empiric, with whom he still\nmaintained a slight correspondence; and to whose house he steered his\ncourse, in great perplexity and tribulation. That gentleman, instead of\nconsoling him with assurances of friendship and protection, faithfully\nrecapitulated all the instances of his indiscretion and misconduct,\ntaxed him with want of sincerity in the West India affair, as well as\nwith want of honesty in this last marriage, while his former wife was\nalive; and, finally, reminded him of his notes, which he desired might\nbe immediately taken up, as he (the quack) had present occasion for a\nsum of money.Ferdinand, seeing it would be impracticable to derive any succour from\nthis quarter, sneaked homewards, in order to hold a consultation with\nhis own thoughts; and the first object that presented itself to his\neyes when he entered his apartment, was a letter from the tradesman,\nwith his account inclosed, amounting to forty-five pounds, which the\nwriter desired might be paid without delay. Before he had time to\nperuse the articles, he received a summons, in consequence of a bill of\nindictment for bigamy, found against him in Hicks’ Hall, by Sarah\nMuddy, widow; and, while he was revolving measures to avert these\nstorms, another billet arrived from a certain attorney, giving him to\nunderstand, that he had orders from Doctor Buffalo, the quack, to sue\nhim for the payment of several notes, unless he would take them up in\nthree days from the date of this letter."

All his fortitude was insufficient to bear him\nup against this torrent of misfortunes; his resources were all dried\nup, his invention failed, and his reflection began to take a new turn.\n“To what purpose,” said he to himself, “have I deserted the paths of\nintegrity and truth, and exhausted a fruitful imagination, in\ncontriving schemes to betray my fellow-creatures, if, instead of\nacquiring a splendid fortune, which was my aim, I have suffered such a\nseries of mortifications, and at last brought myself to the brink of\ninevitable destruction? By a virtuous exertion of those talents I\ninherit from nature and education, I might, long before this time, have\nrendered myself independent, and, perhaps, conspicuous in life. I might\nhave grown up like a young oak, which, being firmly rooted in its\nkindred soil, gradually raises up its lofty head, expands its leafy\narms, projects a noble shade, and towers the glory of the plain. I\nshould have paid the debt of gratitude to my benefactors, and made\ntheir hearts sing with joy for the happy effects of their benevolence.\nI should have been a bulwark to my friends, a shelter to my neighbours\nin distress. I should have run the race of honour, seen my fame\ndiffused like a sweet-smelling odour, and felt the ineffable pleasure\nof doing good. Whereas I am, after a vicissitude of disappointments,\ndangers, and fatigues, reduced to misery and shame, aggravated by a\nconscience loaded with treachery and guilt. I have abused the\nconfidence and generosity of my patron; I have defrauded his family,\nunder the mask of sincerity and attachment; I have taken the most cruel\nand base advantages of virtue in distress; I have seduced unsuspecting\ninnocence to ruin and despair; I have violated the most sacred trust\nreposed in me by my friend and benefactor; I have betrayed his love,\ntorn his noble heart asunder, by means of the most perfidious slander\nand false insinuations; and, finally, brought to an untimely grave the\nfairest pattern of human beauty and perfection.
