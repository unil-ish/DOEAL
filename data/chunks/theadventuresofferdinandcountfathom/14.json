  "content": "The lawyer, startled at this intelligence, set on foot a minute inquiry\ninto the life and conversation of the doctor, which turned out so\nlittle to the advantage of his character and circumstances, that he\nresolved, if possible, to disunite him from his family; and, as a\nprevious step, repeated to his sister all that he had heard to the\nprejudice of her husband, not forgetting to produce the evidence of his\nmistress, who laid claim to him by a prior title, which, she pretended,\ncould be proved by the testimony of the clergyman who joined them. Such\nan explanation could not fail to inflame the resentment of the injured\nwife, who, at the very first opportunity, giving a loose to the\nimpetuosity of her temper, upbraided our hero with the most bitter\ninvectives for his perfidious dealing.Ferdinand, conscious of his own innocence, which he had not always to\nplead, far from attempting to soothe her indignation, assumed the\nauthority and prerogative of a husband, and sharply reprehended her for\nher credulity and indecent warmth. This rebuke, instead of silencing,\ngave new spirit and volubility to her reproaches, in the course of\nwhich she plainly taxed him with want of honesty and affection, and\nsaid that, though his pretence was love, his aim was no other than a\nbase design upon her fortune.Fathom, stung with these accusations, which he really did not deserve,\nreplied with uncommon heat, and charged her in his turn with want of\nsincerity and candour, in the false account she had given of that same\nfortune before marriage. He even magnified his own condescension, in\nsurrendering his liberty to a woman who had so little to recommend her\nto the addresses of the other sex; a reflection which provoked this\nmild creature to such a degree of animosity, that, forgetting her duty\nand allegiance, she lent him a box on the ear with such energy as made\nhis eyes water; and he, for the honour of manhood and sovereignty,\nhaving washed her face with a dish of tea, withdrew abruptly to a\ncoffee-house in the neighbourhood, where he had not long remained, when\nhis passion subsided, and he then saw the expediency of an immediate\nreconciliation, which he resolved to purchase, even at the expense of a\nsubmission."

Smarting as he was from the\nexpense of lawsuits, he dreaded a prosecution for bigamy, which, though\nhe had justice on his side, he knew he could not of himself support.\nBesides, all his other schemes of life were frustrated by this unlucky\nelopement. He therefore speedily determined to anticipate, as much as\nin him lay, the malice of his enemies, and to obtain, without delay,\nauthentic documents of his marriage. With this view, he hastened to the\nhouse of the tradesman, who, with his wife, had been witness to the\nceremony and consummation; and, in order to interest them the more\nwarmly in his cause, made a pathetic recital of this unhappy breach, in\nwhich he had suffered such injury and insult. But all his rhetoric\nwould not avail. Mrs. Muddy had been beforehand with him, and had\nproved the better orator of the two; for she had assailed this honest\ncouple with such tropes and figures of eloquence, as were altogether\nirresistible."

Then\nthe wife, who was the common mouth upon all such occasions, contracting\nher features into a very formal disposition, “I’ll assure you,” said\nshe, “Doctor Fathom, my husband and I have been in a very great\nterrification and numplush, to hear such bad things of a person, whom,\nas one may say, we thought a worthy gentleman, and were ready to serve\nat all times, by day and by night, as the saying is. And besides, for\nall that, you know, and God knows, as we are dustrious people, and work\nhard for what we get, and we have served gentlemen to our own harm,\nwhereby my husband was last Tuesday served with a siserary, being that\nhe was bound for an officer that ran away. And I said to my husband,\nTimothy, says I, ’tis a very hard thing for one to ruin one’s self for\nstranger people—There’s Doctor Fathom, says I, his account comes to\nnine-and-forty pounds seven shillings and fourpence halfpenny; and you\nknow, doctor, that was before your last bill began. But, howsomever,\nlittle did I think, as how a gentleman of your learning would go to\ndeceive a poor gentlewoman, when you had another wife alive.”In vain did our adventurer endeavour to vindicate himself from this\naspersion; the good woman, like a great many modern disputants,\nproceeded with her declamation, without seeming to hear what was said\non the other side of the question; and the husband was altogether\nneutral. At length, Ferdinand, finding all his protestations\nineffectual, “Well,” said he, “though you are resolved, I see, to\ndiscredit all that I can say in opposition to that scandalous slander,\nof which I can easily acquit myself in a court of justice, surely you\nwill not refuse to grant me a certificate, signifying that you were\npresent at the ceremony of my marriage with this unhappy woman.” “You\nshall excuse us,” replied the female orator; “people cannot be too wary\nin signing their names in this wicked world; many a one has been\nbrought to ruination by signing his name, and my husband shall not,\nwith my goodwill, draw himself into such a primmineery.”Fathom, alarmed at this refusal, earnestly argued against the\ninhumanity and injustice of it, appealing to their own consciences for\nthe reasonableness of his proposal; but, from the evasive answers of\nthe wife, he had reason to believe, that, long before the time of\ntrial, they would take care to have forgotten the whole transaction.Though he was equally confounded and incensed at this instance of their\nperfidy, he durst not manifest his indignation, conscious of the\nadvantage they had over him in divers respects; but repaired, without\nloss of time, to the lodging of the clergyman who had noosed him,\nresolved to consult his register, and secure his evidence. Here too his\nevil genius had got the start of him; for the worthy ecclesiastic not\nonly could not recollect his features, or find his name in the\nregister, but, when importuned by his pressing remonstrances, took\numbrage at the freedom of his behaviour, and threatened, if he would\nnot immediately take himself away, to raise the posse of the Fleet, for\nthe safety of his own person."

But, alas! he met with such a reception as he had reason\nto expect from a slighted woman, who had never felt any real attachment\nfor his person. She did not upbraid him with his cruelty in leaving her\nas a mistress, but, with a species of effrontery never enough to be\nadmired, reproached him with his villany, in abandoning her, who was\nhis true and lawful wife, to go and ruin a poor gentlewoman, by whose\nfortune he had been allured.When he attempted to expostulate with this virago, upon the barbarity\nof this assertion, she very prudently declined engaging in private\nconversation with such an artful and wicked man; and, calling up the\npeople of the house, insisted upon his being conducted to the door.CHAPTER FIFTY-SIXIN WHICH HIS FORTUNE IS EFFECTUALLY STRANGLED.The last resource, and that upon which he least depended, was the\nadvice and assistance of his old friend the empiric, with whom he still\nmaintained a slight correspondence; and to whose house he steered his\ncourse, in great perplexity and tribulation. That gentleman, instead of\nconsoling him with assurances of friendship and protection, faithfully\nrecapitulated all the instances of his indiscretion and misconduct,\ntaxed him with want of sincerity in the West India affair, as well as\nwith want of honesty in this last marriage, while his former wife was\nalive; and, finally, reminded him of his notes, which he desired might\nbe immediately taken up, as he (the quack) had present occasion for a\nsum of money.Ferdinand, seeing it would be impracticable to derive any succour from\nthis quarter, sneaked homewards, in order to hold a consultation with\nhis own thoughts; and the first object that presented itself to his\neyes when he entered his apartment, was a letter from the tradesman,\nwith his account inclosed, amounting to forty-five pounds, which the\nwriter desired might be paid without delay. Before he had time to\nperuse the articles, he received a summons, in consequence of a bill of\nindictment for bigamy, found against him in Hicks’ Hall, by Sarah\nMuddy, widow; and, while he was revolving measures to avert these\nstorms, another billet arrived from a certain attorney, giving him to\nunderstand, that he had orders from Doctor Buffalo, the quack, to sue\nhim for the payment of several notes, unless he would take them up in\nthree days from the date of this letter."

All his fortitude was insufficient to bear him\nup against this torrent of misfortunes; his resources were all dried\nup, his invention failed, and his reflection began to take a new turn.\n“To what purpose,” said he to himself, “have I deserted the paths of\nintegrity and truth, and exhausted a fruitful imagination, in\ncontriving schemes to betray my fellow-creatures, if, instead of\nacquiring a splendid fortune, which was my aim, I have suffered such a\nseries of mortifications, and at last brought myself to the brink of\ninevitable destruction? By a virtuous exertion of those talents I\ninherit from nature and education, I might, long before this time, have\nrendered myself independent, and, perhaps, conspicuous in life. I might\nhave grown up like a young oak, which, being firmly rooted in its\nkindred soil, gradually raises up its lofty head, expands its leafy\narms, projects a noble shade, and towers the glory of the plain. I\nshould have paid the debt of gratitude to my benefactors, and made\ntheir hearts sing with joy for the happy effects of their benevolence.\nI should have been a bulwark to my friends, a shelter to my neighbours\nin distress. I should have run the race of honour, seen my fame\ndiffused like a sweet-smelling odour, and felt the ineffable pleasure\nof doing good. Whereas I am, after a vicissitude of disappointments,\ndangers, and fatigues, reduced to misery and shame, aggravated by a\nconscience loaded with treachery and guilt. I have abused the\nconfidence and generosity of my patron; I have defrauded his family,\nunder the mask of sincerity and attachment; I have taken the most cruel\nand base advantages of virtue in distress; I have seduced unsuspecting\ninnocence to ruin and despair; I have violated the most sacred trust\nreposed in me by my friend and benefactor; I have betrayed his love,\ntorn his noble heart asunder, by means of the most perfidious slander\nand false insinuations; and, finally, brought to an untimely grave the\nfairest pattern of human beauty and perfection. Shall the author of\nthese crimes pass with impunity? Shall he hope to prosper in the midst\nof such enormous guilt? It were an imputation upon Providence to\nsuppose it! Ah, no! I begin to feel myself overtaken by the eternal\njustice of Heaven! I totter on the edge of wretchedness and woe,\nwithout one friendly hand to save me from the terrible abyss!”"

Thus determined, he packed up his\nnecessaries in a portmanteau, attempted to amuse his creditors with\npromises of speedy payment, and, venturing to come forth in the dark,\ntook a place in the Canterbury stage-coach, after having converted his\nsuperfluities into ready money. These steps were not taken with such\nprivacy as to elude the vigilance of his adversaries; for, although he\nhad been cautious enough to transport himself and his baggage to the\ninn on Sunday evening, and never doubted that the vehicle, which set\nout at four o’clock on Monday morning, would convey him out of the\nreach of his creditors, before they could possibly obtain a writ for\nsecuring his person, they had actually taken such precautions as\nfrustrated all his finesse; and the coach being stopped in the borough\nof Southwark, Doctor Fathom was seized by virtue of a warrant obtained\non a criminal indictment, and was forthwith conducted to the prison of\nthe King’s Bench; yet, not before he had, by his pathetic\nremonstrances, excited the compassion, and even drawn tears from the\neyes of his fellow-passengers.He no sooner recollected himself from the shock which must have been\noccasioned by this sinister incident, than he despatched a letter to\nhis brother-in-law, the counsellor, requesting an immediate conference,\nin which he promised to make such a proposal as would save him all the\nexpense of a lawsuit and trial, and, at the same time, effectually\nanswer all the purposes of both. He was accordingly favoured with a\nvisit from the lawyer, to whom, after the most solemn protestations of\nhis own innocence, he declared, that, finding himself unable to wage\nwar against such powerful antagonists, he had resolved even to abandon\nhis indubitable right, and retire into another country, in order to\nscreen himself from persecution, and remove all cause of disquiet from\nthe prosecutrix, when he was, unfortunately, prevented by the warrant\nwhich had been executed against him. He said he was still willing, for\nthe sake of his liberty, to sign a formal renunciation of his\npretensions to Mrs. Fathom and her fortune, provided the deeds could be\nexecuted, and the warrant withdrawn, before he should be detained by\nhis other creditors; and, lastly, he conjured the barrister to spare\nhimself the guilt and the charge of suborning evidence for the\ndestruction of an unhappy man, whose misfortune was his only fault."

Next day, he returned with an order to release our hero,\nwho, being formally discharged, was conducted by the lawyer to a tavern\nin the neighbourhood, where the releases were exchanged, and everything\nconcluded with amity and concord. This business being happily\ntransacted, Fathom stept into a hackney-coach, with his baggage, and\nwas followed by a bailiff, who told him, with great composure, that he\nwas again a prisoner, at the suit of Doctor Buffalo, and desired the\ncoachman to reconduct him to the lodging he had so lately discharged.Fathom, whose fortitude had been hitherto of the pagan temper, was now\nfain to reinforce it with the philosophy of Christian resignation,\nthough he had not as yet arrived to such a pitch of self-denial as to\nforgive the counsellor, to whose double dealing he imputed this new\ncalamity. After having received the compliments of the jailer on his\nrecommitment, he took pen, ink, and paper, and composed an artful and\naffecting epistle to the empiric, imploring his mercy, flattering his\nweakness, and demonstrating the bad policy of cooping up an unhappy man\nin a jail, where he could never have an opportunity of doing justice to\nhis creditors; nor did he forget to declare his intention of retiring\ninto another country, where he might have some chance of earning a\nsubsistence, which he had so long toiled for to no purpose in England.\nThis last declaration he made in consequence of the jealous disposition\nof the quack, who he knew had long looked upon him in the odious light\nof an interloping rival. However, he reaped no benefit from this\nsupplication, which served only to gratify the pride of Buffalo, who\nproduced the extravagant encomiums which Fathom had bestowed upon him,\nas so many testimonials of his foe’s bearing witness to his virtue.CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVENFATHOM BEING SAFELY HOUSED, THE READER IS ENTERTAINED WITH A\nRETROSPECT."

  "content": "But now it is high time to leave our adventurer to chew the cud of\nreflection and remorse in this solitary mansion, that we may trace\nRenaldo in the several steps he took to assert his right, and do\njustice to his family. Never man indulged a more melancholy train of\nideas than that which accompanied him in his journey to the Imperial\ncourt. For, notwithstanding the manifold reasons he had to expect a\nhappy issue to his aim, his imagination was incessantly infected with\nsomething that chilled his nerves and saddened his heart, recurring,\nwith quick succession, like the unwearied wave that beats upon the\nbleak, inhospitable Greenland shore. This, the reader will easily\nsuppose, was no other than the remembrance of the forlorn Monimia,\nwhose image appeared to his fancy in different attitudes, according to\nthe prevalence of the passions which raged in his bosom. Sometimes he\nviewed her in the light of apostasy, and then his soul was maddened\nwith indignation and despair. But these transitory blasts were not able\nto efface the impressions she had formerly made upon his heart;\nimpressions which he had so often and so long contemplated with\ninconceivable rapture. These pictures still remained, representing her\nfair as the most perfect idea of beauty, soft and tender as an angel of\nmercy and compassion, warmed with every virtue of the heart, and\nadorned with every accomplishment of human nature. Yet the alarming\ncontrast came still in the rear of this recollection; so that his soul\nwas by turns agitated by the tempests of horror, and overwhelmed by the\nfloods of grief.He recalled the moment on which he first beheld her, with that pleasing\nregret which attends the memory of a dear deceased friend. Then he\nbitterly cursed it, as the source of all his misfortunes and\naffliction. He thanked Heaven for having blessed him with a friend to\ndetect her perfidy and ingratitude; and then ardently wished he had\nstill continued under the influence of her delusion. In a word, the\nloneliness of his situation aggravated every horror of his reflection;\nfor, as he found himself without company, his imagination was never\nsolicited, or his attention diverted from these subjects of woe; and he\ntravelled to Brussels in a reverie, fraught with such torments as must\nhave entirely wrecked his reason, had not Providence interposed in his\nbehalf. He was, by his postillion, conducted to one of the best inns of\nthe place, where he understood the cloth was already laid for supper;\nand as the ordinary is open to strangers in all these houses of\nentertainment, he introduced himself into the company, with a view to\nalleviate, in some measure, his sorrow and chagrin, by the conversation\nof his fellow-guests. Yet he was so ill prepared to obtain the relief\nwhich he courted, that he entered the apartment, and sat down to table,\nwithout distinguishing either the number or countenances of those who\nwere present, though he himself did not long remain so unregarded. His\nmien and deportment produced a prepossession in his favour; and the air\nof affliction, so remarkable in his visage, did not fail to attract\ntheir sympathy and observation."

Before the day fixed for\ntheir departure arrived, this gentleman found means to insinuate\nhimself so far into the confidence of the Count, as to learn the cause\nof that distress which he had observed in his features at their first\nmeeting; and being a gentleman of uncommon vivacity, as well as\nsincerely attached to the family of Melvil, to which he had owed his\npromotion, he exerted all his good-humour and good sense in amusing the\nfancy, and reasoning down the mortification of the afflicted Hungarian.\nHe in particular endeavoured to wean his attention from the lost\nMonimia, by engaging it upon his domestic affairs, and upon the wrongs\nof his mother and sister, who, he gave him to understand, were\nlanguishing under the tyranny of his father-in-law.This was a note that effectually roused him from the lethargy of his\nsorrow; and the desire of taking vengeance on the oppressor, who had\nruined his fortune, and made his nearest relations miserable, so\nentirely engrossed his thoughts, as to leave no room for other\nconsiderations.

They were, moreover, equally surprised and chagrined, when they\nfound she took no step to prevent his seizing upon that inheritance\nwhich of right belonged to you, and which, by the laws of Hungary, is\nunalienable from the heir of blood. Nevertheless, they are now fully\nconvinced, that she hath more than sufficiently atoned for her\nindiscretion, by the barbarity of her husband, who hath not only\nsecluded her from all communication with her friends and acquaintance,\nbut even confined her to the west tower of your father’s house, where\nshe is said to be kept close prisoner, and subjected to all sorts of\ninconvenience and mortification. This severity she is believed to have\nincurred in consequence of having expostulated to him upon his unjust\nbehaviour to you and Mademoiselle, whom he hath actually shut up in\nsome convent in Vienna, which your relations have not as yet been able\nto discover. But the memory of your noble father is so dear to all\nthose who were favoured with his friendship, and the sufferings of the\nCountess and Mademoiselle have raised such a spirit of resentment\nagainst her cruel jailor, that nothing is wanted but your presence to\nbegin the prosecution, and give a sanction to the measures of your\nfriends, which will in a little time restore your family to the\nfruition of its rights and fortune. For my own part, my dear Count, I\nconsider myself as one wholly indebted to your house for the rank and\nexpectation I now enjoy; and my finances, interest, and person, such as\nthey are, I dedicate to your service.”Renaldo was not slow in making his acknowledgments to this generous\nHibernian, whom he informed of his scheme, recounting to him his\nuncommon transaction with the benevolent Jew, and communicating the\nletters of recommendation he had received by his means to some of the\nfirst noblemen at the Imperial court. Meanwhile, he burned with\nimpatience to chastise Count Trebasi for his perfidious conduct to the\nwidow and the fatherless, and would have taken the road to Presburg,\nwithout touching at Vienna, in order to call him to a severe account,\nhad not he been strenuously opposed by Major Farrel, who represented\nthe imprudence of taking such a step before he had secured a proper\nprotection from the consequences with which it might be attended.“It is not,” said he, “your own life and fortune only which depend upon\nyour behaviour in this emergency, but also the quiet and happiness of\nthose who are most dear to your affection. Not you alone, but likewise\nyour mother and sister, would infallibly suffer by your temerity and\nprecipitation. First of all, deliver your credentials at court, and let\nus join our endeavours to raise an interest strong enough to\ncounterbalance that of Trebasi. If we succeed, there will be no\nnecessity for having recourse to personal measures. He will be\ncompelled to yield up your inheritance which he unjustly detains, and\nto restore your sister to your arms; and if he afterwards refuses to do\njustice to the Countess, you will always have it in your power to\nevince yourself the son of the brave Count de Melvil.”"

So far his stratagem\nsucceeded; he had not long stood in waiting before he was invited into\nthe court-yard, where the servants formed a ring, and danced to the\nefforts of his companion’s skill; then he was conducted into the\nbuttery, where he exhibited his figures on the wall, and his princess\non the floor; and while they regaled him in this manner with scraps and\nsour wine, he took occasion to inquire about the old lady and her\ndaughter, before whom he said he had performed in his last\nperegrination.

However, instead of protesting his innocence\nin an humble and beseeching strain, in order to acquit himself of the\ncharge, he resolved to elude the suspicion by provoking the wrath of\nhis accuser, and, putting on the air of vulgar integrity affronted,\nbegan to reproach the servant in very insolent terms for his unfair\nsupposition, and undressed himself in a moment to the skin, threw his\ntattered garments in the face of his adversary, telling him he would\nfind nothing there which he would not be very glad to part with; at the\nsame time raising his voice, he, in the gibberish of the clan he\nrepresented, scolded and cursed with great fluency, so that the whole\nhouse resounded with the noise. The valet’s jealousy, like a smaller\nfire, was in a trice swallowed up in the greater flame of his rage\nenkindled by this abrupt address. In consequence of which, Farrel was\nkicked out at the gate, naked as he was to the waist, after his\nlanthorn had been broke to pieces on his head; and there he was joined\nby his domestic, who had not been able to recover his apparel and\neffect a retreat, without incurring marks of the same sort of\ndistinction.The Major, considering the risk he must have run in being detected,\nthought himself cheaply quit for this moderate discipline, though he\nwas really concerned for his friend Renaldo, who, understanding the\nparticulars of the adventure, determined, as the last effort, to ride\nround the castle in the open day, on pretence of taking the air, when,\nperadventure, the Countess would see him from the place of her\nconfinement, and favour him with some mark or token of her being alive."

  "content": "Though his companion did not much relish this plan, which he foresaw\nwould expose him to the insults of Trebasi, yet, as he could not\ncontrive a better, he acquiesced in Renaldo’s invention, with the\nproviso that he would defer the execution of it until his father-in-law\nshould be absent in the chase, which was a diversion he every day\nenjoyed.Accordingly they set a proper watch, and lay concealed until they were\ninformed of Trebasi’s having gone forth; when they mounted their\nhorses, and rode into the neighbourhood of the castle. Having made a\nsmall excursion in the adjoining fields, they drew nearer the walls,\nand at an easy pace had twice circled them, when Farrel descried, at\nthe top of a tower, a white handkerchief waved by a woman’s hand\nthrough the iron bars that secured the window. This signal being\npointed out to Renaldo, his heart began to throb with great violence;\nhe made a respectful obeisance towards the part in which it appeared,\nand perceiving the hand beckoning him to approach, advanced to the very\nbuttress of the turret; upon which, seeing something drop, he alighted\nwith great expedition, and took up a picture of his father in\nminiature, the features of which he no sooner distinguished, than the\ntears ran down his cheeks; he pressed the little image to his lips with\nthe most filial fervour; then conveying it to his bosom, looked up to\nthe hand, which waved in such a manner as gave him to understand it was\nhigh time to retire. Being by this time highly persuaded that his kind\nmonitor was no other than the Countess herself, he pointed to his\nheart, in token of his filial affection, and laying his hand on his\nsword, to denote his resolution of doing her justice, he took his leave\nwith another profound bow, and suffered himself to be reconducted to\nhis lodging."

Alarmed at this information, from\nwhich he immediately concluded that the stranger was young Melvil, he\nforthwith quitted the chase, and returning to the castle by a private\npostern, ordered his horse to be kept ready saddled, in hope that his\nson-in-law would repeat the visit to his mother. This precaution would\nhave been to no purpose, had Renaldo followed the advice of Farrel, who\nrepresented the danger of returning to a place where the alarm was\nundoubtedly given by his first appearance; and exhorted him to return\nto Vienna for the prosecution of his suit, now that he was satisfied of\nhis mother’s being alive. In order to strengthen this admonition, he\nbade him recollect the signal for withdrawing, which was doubtless the\neffect of maternal concern, inspired by the knowledge of the Count’s\nvigilance and vindictive disposition.Notwithstanding these suggestions, Melvil persisted in his resolution\nof appearing once more below the tower, on the supposition that his\nmother, in expectation of his return, had prepared a billet for his\nacceptance, from which he might obtain important intelligence. The\nMajor, seeing him lend a deaf ear to his remonstrances, was contented\nto attend him in his second expedition, which he pressed him to\nundertake that same afternoon, as Trebasi had taken care to circulate a\nreport of his having gone to dine at the seat of a nobleman in the\nneighbourhood. Our knight-errant and his squire, deceived by this\nfinesse, presented themselves again under the prison of the Countess,\nwho no sooner beheld her son return, than she earnestly entreated him\nto be gone, by the same sign which she had before used; and he, taking\nit for granted that she was debarred the use of pen, ink, and paper,\nand that she had nothing more to expect, consented to retire, and had\nalready moved to some distance from the house, when, in crossing a\nsmall plantation that belonged to the castle, they were met by Count\nTrebasi and another person on horseback.At sight of this apparition, the blood mounted into Renaldo’s cheeks,\nand his eyes began to lighten with eagerness and indignation; which was\nnot at all diminished by the ferocious address of the Count, who\nadvancing to Melvil, with a menacing air. “Before you proceed,” said\nhe, “I must know with what view you have been twice to-day patroling\nround my enclosures, and reconnoitring the different avenues of my\nhouse. You likewise carry on a clandestine correspondence with some\nperson in the family, of which my honour obliges me to demand an\nexplanation.”"

It is my part, therefore, to expostulate; and, since\nfortune hath favoured me with an opportunity of revenging our wrongs in\nperson, we shall not part until you have learned that the family of the\nCount de Melvil is not to be injured with impunity. Here is no\nadvantage on either side, in point of arms or number; you are better\nmounted than I am, and shall have the choice of the ground on which our\ndifference ought to be brought to a speedy determination.”Trebasi, whose courage was not of the sentimental kind, but purely\nowing to his natural insensibility of danger, instead of concerting\nmeasures coolly for the engagement, or making any verbal reply to this\ndefiance, drew a pistol, without the least hesitation, and fired it at\nthe face of Renaldo, part of whose left eyebrow was carried off by the\nball. Melvil was not slow in returning the compliment, which, as it was\ndeliberate, proved the more decisive. For the shot entering the Count’s\nright breast, made its way to the backbone with such a shock, as struck\nhim to the ground; upon which the other alighted, in order to improve\nthe advantage he had gained."

The Hibernian’s horse being a common\nhireling, and unaccustomed to stand fire, no sooner saw the flash of\nTrebasi’s pistol, than, starting aside, he happened to plunge into a\nhole, and was overturned at the very instant when the hussar’s piece\nwent off, so that no damage ensued to his rider, who, pitching on his\nfeet, flew with great nimbleness to his adversary, then, laying hold on\none leg, dismounted him in a twinkling, and, seizing his throat as he\nlay, would have soon despatched him without the use of firearms, had he\nnot been prevented by his friend Renaldo, who desired him to desist,\nobserving that his vengeance was already satisfied, as the Count seemed\nto be in the agonies of death. The Major was loth to quit his prey, as\nhe thought his aggressor had acted in a treacherous manner; but\nrecollecting that there was no time to lose, because, in all\nprobability, the firing had alarmed the castle, he took his leave of\nthe vanquished hussar, with a couple of hearty kicks, and, mounting his\nhorse, followed Melvil to the house of a gentleman in the\nneighbourhood, who was kinsman to the Countess, and very well disposed\nto grant him a secure retreat, until the troublesome consequences of\nthis rencontre should be overblown.Trebasi, though to the young gentleman he seemed speechless and\ninsensible, had neither lost the use of his reason nor of his tongue,\nbut affected that extremity, in order to avoid any further conversation\nwith the victor. He was one of those people who never think of death\nuntil he knocks at the door, and then earnestly entreat him to excuse\nthem for the present, and be so good as to call another time. The Count\nhad so often escaped unhurt, in the course of his campaigns, that he\nlooked upon himself as invulnerable, and set all danger at defiance.\nThough he had hitherto taken no care of the concerns of his soul, he\nhad a large fund of superstition at bottom; and, when the surgeon, who\nexamined his wound, declared it was mortal, all the terrors of futurity\ntook hold on his imagination, all the misdemeanours of his life\npresented themselves in aggravated colours to his recollection.He implored the spiritual assistance of a good priest in the\nneighbourhood, who, in the discharge of his own conscience, gave him to\nunderstand that he had little mercy to expect, unless he would, as much\nas lay in his power, redress the injuries he had done to his\nfellow-creatures. As nothing lay heavier upon his soul than the cruelty\nand fraud he had practised upon the family of Count Melvil, he\nearnestly besought this charitable clergyman to mediate his pardon with\nthe Countess, and at the same time desired to see Renaldo before his\ndeath, that he might put him in possession of his paternal estate, and\nsolicit his forgiveness for the offence he had given."

Her son gladly obeyed the summons, and was\nreceived with great civility and satisfaction by his father-in-law,\nwho, in presence of the judge and divers gentlemen assembled for that\npurpose, renounced all right and title to the fortune he had so\nunjustly usurped; disclosed the name of the convent to which\nMademoiselle de Melvil had been conveyed, dismissed all the agents of\nhis iniquity, and being reconciled to his son-in-law, began to prepare\nhimself in tranquillity for his latter end.The Countess was overwhelmed with an excess of joy, while she embraced\nher long-lost son, who had proved himself so worthy of his father. Yet\nthis joy was embittered, by reflecting that she was made a widow by the\nhands of that darling son. For, though she knew his honour demanded the\nsacrifice, she could not lay aside that regard and veneration which is\nattached to the name of husband; and therefore resolved to retire into\na monastery, where she could spend the remainder of her life in\ndevotion, without being exposed to any intercourse which might\ninterfere with the delicacy of her sentiments on that subject.CHAPTER FIFTY-NINEHE IS THE MESSENGER OF HAPPINESS TO HIS SISTER, WHO REMOVES THE FILM\nWHICH HAD LONG OBSTRUCTED HIS PENETRATION, WITH REGARD TO COUNT FATHOM.As the most endearing affection had always subsisted between Renaldo\nand his sister, he would not one moment deny himself the pleasure of\nflying to her embrace, and of being the glad messenger of her\ndeliverance. Soon, therefore, as he understood the place of her\nretreat, and had obtained a proper order to the abbess, signed by Count\nTrebasi, he set out post for Vienna, still accompanied by his faithful\nHibernian, and, arriving at the convent, found the abbess and the whole\nhouse so engrossed in making preparations for the ceremony of giving\nthe veil next day to a young woman who had fulfilled the term of her\nprobation, that he could not possibly see his sister with that leisure\nand satisfaction which he had flattered himself with enjoying at this\nmeeting; and therefore he was fain to bridle his impatience for two\ndays, and keep his credentials until the hurry should be over, that\nMademoiselle might have no intimation of her good fortune, except from\nhis own mouth."

His highness, moreover, appointed the following day for\nperforming the promise he had made of presenting him to that august\nprincess, and in the meantime prepossessed her so much in his favour,\nthat when he approached her presence, and was announced by his noble\nintroductor, she eyed him with a look of peculiar complacency, saying,\n“I am glad to see you returned to my dominions. Your father was a\ngallant officer, who served our house with equal courage and fidelity;\nand as I understand you tread in his footsteps, you may depend upon my\nfavour and protection.”He was so much overwhelmed with this gracious reception, that, while he\nbowed in silence, the drops of gratitude trickled from his eyes; and\nher imperial majesty was so well pleased with this manifestation of his\nheart, that she immediately gave directions for promoting him to the\ncommand of a troop of horse. Thus fortune seemed willing, and indeed\neager to discharge the debt she owed him for the different calamities\nhe had undergone. And as he looked upon the generous Hebrew to be the\nsole source of his success, he did not fail to make him acquainted with\nthe happy effects of his recommendation and friendship, and to express,\nin the warmest terms, the deep sense he had of his uncommon\nbenevolence, which, by the bye, was still greater, with regard to\nRenaldo, than the reader as yet imagines; for he not only furnished him\nwith money for his present occasions, but also gave him an unlimited\ncredit on a banker in Vienna, to whom one of his letters was directed.The ceremony of the nun’s admission being now performed, and the\nconvent restored to its former quiet, Melvil hastened thither on the\nwings of brotherly affection, and presented his letter to the abbess,\nwho having perused the contents, by which she learned that the family\ndisquiets of Count Trebasi no longer subsisted, and that the bearer was\nthe brother of Mademoiselle, she received him with great politeness,\ncongratulated him on this happy event, and, begging he would excuse her\nstaying with him in the parlour, on pretence of business, withdrew,\nsaying, she would immediately send in a young lady who would console\nhim for her absence.
