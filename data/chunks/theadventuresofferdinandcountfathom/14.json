  "content": "CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVEAFTER DIVERS UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS, HE HAS RECOURSE TO THE MATRIMONIAL\nNOOSE.Chancing to meet with one of his acquaintance at a certain\ncoffee-house, the discourse turned upon the characters of mankind,\nwhen, among other oddities, his friend brought upon the carpet a\ncertain old gentlewoman of such a rapacious disposition, that, like a\njackdaw, she never beheld any metalline substance, without an\ninclination, and even an effort to secrete it for her own use and\ncontemplation. Nor was this infirmity originally produced from\nindigence, inasmuch as her circumstances had been always affluent, and\nshe was now possessed of a considerable sum of money in the funds;\nnotwithstanding which, the avarice of her nature tempted her to let\nlodgings, though few people could live under the same roof with such an\noriginal, who, rather than be idle, had often filched pieces of her own\nplate, and charged her servants with the theft, or hinted suspicion of\nher lodgers. Fathom, struck with the description, soon perceived how\nthis woman’s disease might be converted to his advantage; and after\nhaving obtained sufficient intelligence, on pretence of satisfying his\ncuriosity, he visited the widow, in consequence of a bill at her door,\nand actually hired an apartment in her house, whither he forthwith\nrepaired with his inamorata."

  "content": "It was not long before he perceived that his landlady’s character had\nnot been misrepresented. He fed her distemper with divers\ninconsiderable trinkets, such as copper medals, corkscrews, odd\nbuckles, and a paltry seal set in silver, which were, at different\ntimes, laid as baits for her infirmity, and always conveyed away with\nremarkable eagerness, which he and his Dulcinea took pleasure in\nobserving from an unsuspected place. Thus confirmed in his opinion, he,\nat length, took an opportunity of exposing a metal watch that belonged\nto his mistress, and saw it seized with great satisfaction, in the\nabsence of his helpmate, who had gone abroad on purpose. According to\ninstruction, she soon returned, and began to raise a terrible clamour\nabout the loss of her watch; upon which she was condoled by her\nlandlady, who seemed to doubt the integrity of the maid, and even\nproposed that Mrs. Fathom should apply to some justice of the peace for\na warrant to search the servant’s trunk. The lady thanked her for the\ngood advice, in compliance with which she had immediate recourse to a\nmagistrate, who granted a search warrant, not against the maid, but the\nmistress; and she, in a little time, returned with the constable at her\nback.These precautions being taken, Doctor Fathom desired a private\nconference with the old gentlewoman, in which he gave her to\nunderstand, that he had undoubted proofs of her having secreted, not\nonly the watch, but also several other odd things of less consequence,\nwhich he lost since his residence in her house. He then showed the\nwarrant he had obtained against her, and asked if she had anything to\noffer why the constable should not do his duty? Inexpressible were the\nanguish and confusion of the defendant, when she found herself thus\nentrapped, and reflected, that she was on the point of being detected\nof felony; for she at once concluded, that the snare was laid for her,\nand knew that the officer of justice would certainly find the unlucky\nwatch in one of the drawers of her scrutoire.Tortured with these suggestions, afraid of public disgrace, and\ndreading the consequence of legal conviction, she fell on her knees\nbefore the injured Fathom, and, after having imputed her crime to the\ntemptations of necessity, implored his compassion, promised to restore\nthe watch, and everything she had taken, and begged he would dismiss\nthe constable, that her reputation might not suffer in the eye of the\nworld."

  "content": "Ferdinand, with a severity of countenance purposely assumed, observed\nthat, were she really indigent, he had charity enough to forgive what\nshe had done; but, as he knew her circumstances were opulent, he looked\nupon this excuse as an aggravation of her guilt, which was certainly\nthe effect of a vicious inclination; and he was therefore determined to\nprosecute her with the utmost severity of the law, as an example and\nterror to others, who might be infected with the same evil disposition.\nFinding him deaf to all her tears and entreaties, she changed her note,\nand offered him one hundred guineas, if he would compromise the affair,\nand drop the prosecution, so as that her character should sustain no\ndamage. After much argumentation, he consented to accept of double the\nsum, which being instantly paid in East India bonds, Doctor Fathom told\nthe constable, that the watch was found; and for once her reputation\nwas patched up. This seasonable supply enabled our hero to stand trial\nwith his adversary, who was nonsuited, and also to mend his external\nappearance, which of late had not been extremely magnificent.Soon after this gleam of good fortune, a tradesman, to whom he was\nconsiderably indebted, seeing no other probable means to recover his\nmoney, introduced Fathom to the acquaintance of a young widow who\nlodged at his house, and was said to be in possession of a considerable\nfortune. Considering the steps that were taken, it would have been\nalmost impossible for him to miscarry in his addresses. The lady had\nbeen bred in the country, was unacquainted with the world, and of a\nvery sanguine disposition, which her short trial of matrimony had not\nserved to cool. Our adventurer was instructed to call at the\ntradesman’s house, as if by accident, at an appointed time, when the\nwidow was drinking tea with her landlady. On these occasions he always\nbehaved to admiration. She liked his person, and praised his\npoliteness, good-humour, and good sense; his confederates extolled him\nas a prodigy of learning, taste, and good-nature; they likewise\nrepresented him as a person on the eve of eclipsing all his competitors\nin physic. An acquaintance and intimacy soon ensued, nor was he\nrestricted in point of opportunity. In a word, he succeeded in his\nendeavours, and, one evening, on pretence of attending her to the play,\nhe accompanied her to the Fleet, where they were married, in presence\nof the tradesman and his wife, who were of the party."

  "content": "This grand affair being accomplished to his satisfaction, he, next day,\nvisited her brother, who was a counsellor of the Temple, to make him\nacquainted with the step his sister had taken; and though the lawyer\nwas not a little mortified to find that she had made such a clandestine\nmatch, he behaved civilly to his new brother-in-law, and gave him to\nunderstand, that his wife’s fortune consisted of a jointure of one\nhundred and fifty pounds a year, and fifteen hundred pounds bequeathed\nto her during her widowhood, by her own father, who had taken the\nprecaution of settling it in the hands of trustees, in such a manner as\nthat any husband she might afterwards espouse should be restricted from\nencroaching upon the capital, which was reserved for the benefit of her\nheirs. This intimation was far from being agreeable to our hero, who\nhad been informed, that this sum was absolutely at the lady’s disposal,\nand had actually destined the greatest part of it for the payment of\nhis debts, for defraying the expense of furnishing an elegant house,\nand setting up a new equipage.Notwithstanding this disappointment, he resolved to carry on his plan\nupon the credit of his marriage, which was published in a very pompous\narticle of the newspapers; a chariot was bespoke, a ready furnished\nhouse immediately taken, and Doctor Fathom began to reappear in all his\nformer splendour.His good friend the empiric, alarmed at this event, which not only\nraised our adventurer into the sphere of a dangerous rival, but also\nfurnished him with means to revenge the ill office he had sustained at\nhis hands on the adventure of the former match—for, by this time,\nFathom had given him some hints, importing, that he was not ignorant of\nhis treacherous behaviour—roused, I say, by these considerations, he\nemployed one of his emissaries, who had some knowledge of Fathom’s\nbrother-in-law, to prejudice him against our adventurer, whom he\nrepresented as a needy sharper, not only overwhelmed with debt and\ndisgrace, but likewise previously married to a poor woman, who was\nprevented by nothing but want from seeking redress at law. To confirm\nthese assertions, he gave him a detail of Fathom’s encumbrances, which\nhe had learned for the purpose, and even brought the counsellor into\ncompany with the person who had lived with our hero before marriage,\nand who was so much incensed at her abrupt dismission, that she did not\nscruple to corroborate these allegations of the informer."

  "content": "The lawyer, startled at this intelligence, set on foot a minute inquiry\ninto the life and conversation of the doctor, which turned out so\nlittle to the advantage of his character and circumstances, that he\nresolved, if possible, to disunite him from his family; and, as a\nprevious step, repeated to his sister all that he had heard to the\nprejudice of her husband, not forgetting to produce the evidence of his\nmistress, who laid claim to him by a prior title, which, she pretended,\ncould be proved by the testimony of the clergyman who joined them. Such\nan explanation could not fail to inflame the resentment of the injured\nwife, who, at the very first opportunity, giving a loose to the\nimpetuosity of her temper, upbraided our hero with the most bitter\ninvectives for his perfidious dealing.Ferdinand, conscious of his own innocence, which he had not always to\nplead, far from attempting to soothe her indignation, assumed the\nauthority and prerogative of a husband, and sharply reprehended her for\nher credulity and indecent warmth. This rebuke, instead of silencing,\ngave new spirit and volubility to her reproaches, in the course of\nwhich she plainly taxed him with want of honesty and affection, and\nsaid that, though his pretence was love, his aim was no other than a\nbase design upon her fortune.Fathom, stung with these accusations, which he really did not deserve,\nreplied with uncommon heat, and charged her in his turn with want of\nsincerity and candour, in the false account she had given of that same\nfortune before marriage. He even magnified his own condescension, in\nsurrendering his liberty to a woman who had so little to recommend her\nto the addresses of the other sex; a reflection which provoked this\nmild creature to such a degree of animosity, that, forgetting her duty\nand allegiance, she lent him a box on the ear with such energy as made\nhis eyes water; and he, for the honour of manhood and sovereignty,\nhaving washed her face with a dish of tea, withdrew abruptly to a\ncoffee-house in the neighbourhood, where he had not long remained, when\nhis passion subsided, and he then saw the expediency of an immediate\nreconciliation, which he resolved to purchase, even at the expense of a\nsubmission."

  "content": "It was pity that such a salutary resolution had not been sooner taken.\nFor, when he returned to his own house, he understood, that Mrs. Fathom\nhad gone abroad in a hackney-coach; and, upon examining her apartment,\nin lieu of her clothes and trinkets, which she had removed with\nadmirable dexterity and despatch, he found this billet in one of the\ndrawers of her bureau:—“Sir, being convinced that you are a cheat and\nan impostor, I have withdrawn myself from your cruelty and\nmachinations, with a view to solicit the protection of the law; and I\ndoubt not but I shall soon be able to prove, that you have no just\ntitle to, or demand upon, the person or effects of the unfortunate\nSarah Muddy.”The time had been when Mr. Fathom would have allowed Mrs. Muddy to\nrefine at her leisure, and blessed God for his happy deliverance; but\nat present the case was quite altered. Smarting as he was from the\nexpense of lawsuits, he dreaded a prosecution for bigamy, which, though\nhe had justice on his side, he knew he could not of himself support.\nBesides, all his other schemes of life were frustrated by this unlucky\nelopement. He therefore speedily determined to anticipate, as much as\nin him lay, the malice of his enemies, and to obtain, without delay,\nauthentic documents of his marriage. With this view, he hastened to the\nhouse of the tradesman, who, with his wife, had been witness to the\nceremony and consummation; and, in order to interest them the more\nwarmly in his cause, made a pathetic recital of this unhappy breach, in\nwhich he had suffered such injury and insult. But all his rhetoric\nwould not avail. Mrs. Muddy had been beforehand with him, and had\nproved the better orator of the two; for she had assailed this honest\ncouple with such tropes and figures of eloquence, as were altogether\nirresistible."

  "content": "Nevertheless, they heard our hero to an end, with great patience. Then\nthe wife, who was the common mouth upon all such occasions, contracting\nher features into a very formal disposition, “I’ll assure you,” said\nshe, “Doctor Fathom, my husband and I have been in a very great\nterrification and numplush, to hear such bad things of a person, whom,\nas one may say, we thought a worthy gentleman, and were ready to serve\nat all times, by day and by night, as the saying is. And besides, for\nall that, you know, and God knows, as we are dustrious people, and work\nhard for what we get, and we have served gentlemen to our own harm,\nwhereby my husband was last Tuesday served with a siserary, being that\nhe was bound for an officer that ran away. And I said to my husband,\nTimothy, says I, ’tis a very hard thing for one to ruin one’s self for\nstranger people—There’s Doctor Fathom, says I, his account comes to\nnine-and-forty pounds seven shillings and fourpence halfpenny; and you\nknow, doctor, that was before your last bill began. But, howsomever,\nlittle did I think, as how a gentleman of your learning would go to\ndeceive a poor gentlewoman, when you had another wife alive.”In vain did our adventurer endeavour to vindicate himself from this\naspersion; the good woman, like a great many modern disputants,\nproceeded with her declamation, without seeming to hear what was said\non the other side of the question; and the husband was altogether\nneutral. At length, Ferdinand, finding all his protestations\nineffectual, “Well,” said he, “though you are resolved, I see, to\ndiscredit all that I can say in opposition to that scandalous slander,\nof which I can easily acquit myself in a court of justice, surely you\nwill not refuse to grant me a certificate, signifying that you were\npresent at the ceremony of my marriage with this unhappy woman.” “You\nshall excuse us,” replied the female orator; “people cannot be too wary\nin signing their names in this wicked world; many a one has been\nbrought to ruination by signing his name, and my husband shall not,\nwith my goodwill, draw himself into such a primmineery.”Fathom, alarmed at this refusal, earnestly argued against the\ninhumanity and injustice of it, appealing to their own consciences for\nthe reasonableness of his proposal; but, from the evasive answers of\nthe wife, he had reason to believe, that, long before the time of\ntrial, they would take care to have forgotten the whole transaction.Though he was equally confounded and incensed at this instance of their\nperfidy, he durst not manifest his indignation, conscious of the\nadvantage they had over him in divers respects; but repaired, without\nloss of time, to the lodging of the clergyman who had noosed him,\nresolved to consult his register, and secure his evidence. Here too his\nevil genius had got the start of him; for the worthy ecclesiastic not\nonly could not recollect his features, or find his name in the\nregister, but, when importuned by his pressing remonstrances, took\numbrage at the freedom of his behaviour, and threatened, if he would\nnot immediately take himself away, to raise the posse of the Fleet, for\nthe safety of his own person."

  "content": "Rather than put the pastor to the trouble of alarming his flock, he\nretreated with a heavy heart, and went in quest of his mistress, whom\nhe had dismissed at his marriage, in hopes of effecting a\nreconciliation, and preventing her from joining in the conspiracy\nagainst him. But, alas! he met with such a reception as he had reason\nto expect from a slighted woman, who had never felt any real attachment\nfor his person. She did not upbraid him with his cruelty in leaving her\nas a mistress, but, with a species of effrontery never enough to be\nadmired, reproached him with his villany, in abandoning her, who was\nhis true and lawful wife, to go and ruin a poor gentlewoman, by whose\nfortune he had been allured.When he attempted to expostulate with this virago, upon the barbarity\nof this assertion, she very prudently declined engaging in private\nconversation with such an artful and wicked man; and, calling up the\npeople of the house, insisted upon his being conducted to the door.CHAPTER FIFTY-SIXIN WHICH HIS FORTUNE IS EFFECTUALLY STRANGLED.The last resource, and that upon which he least depended, was the\nadvice and assistance of his old friend the empiric, with whom he still\nmaintained a slight correspondence; and to whose house he steered his\ncourse, in great perplexity and tribulation. That gentleman, instead of\nconsoling him with assurances of friendship and protection, faithfully\nrecapitulated all the instances of his indiscretion and misconduct,\ntaxed him with want of sincerity in the West India affair, as well as\nwith want of honesty in this last marriage, while his former wife was\nalive; and, finally, reminded him of his notes, which he desired might\nbe immediately taken up, as he (the quack) had present occasion for a\nsum of money.Ferdinand, seeing it would be impracticable to derive any succour from\nthis quarter, sneaked homewards, in order to hold a consultation with\nhis own thoughts; and the first object that presented itself to his\neyes when he entered his apartment, was a letter from the tradesman,\nwith his account inclosed, amounting to forty-five pounds, which the\nwriter desired might be paid without delay. Before he had time to\nperuse the articles, he received a summons, in consequence of a bill of\nindictment for bigamy, found against him in Hicks’ Hall, by Sarah\nMuddy, widow; and, while he was revolving measures to avert these\nstorms, another billet arrived from a certain attorney, giving him to\nunderstand, that he had orders from Doctor Buffalo, the quack, to sue\nhim for the payment of several notes, unless he would take them up in\nthree days from the date of this letter."

All his fortitude was insufficient to bear him\nup against this torrent of misfortunes; his resources were all dried\nup, his invention failed, and his reflection began to take a new turn.\n“To what purpose,” said he to himself, “have I deserted the paths of\nintegrity and truth, and exhausted a fruitful imagination, in\ncontriving schemes to betray my fellow-creatures, if, instead of\nacquiring a splendid fortune, which was my aim, I have suffered such a\nseries of mortifications, and at last brought myself to the brink of\ninevitable destruction? By a virtuous exertion of those talents I\ninherit from nature and education, I might, long before this time, have\nrendered myself independent, and, perhaps, conspicuous in life. I might\nhave grown up like a young oak, which, being firmly rooted in its\nkindred soil, gradually raises up its lofty head, expands its leafy\narms, projects a noble shade, and towers the glory of the plain. I\nshould have paid the debt of gratitude to my benefactors, and made\ntheir hearts sing with joy for the happy effects of their benevolence.\nI should have been a bulwark to my friends, a shelter to my neighbours\nin distress. I should have run the race of honour, seen my fame\ndiffused like a sweet-smelling odour, and felt the ineffable pleasure\nof doing good. Whereas I am, after a vicissitude of disappointments,\ndangers, and fatigues, reduced to misery and shame, aggravated by a\nconscience loaded with treachery and guilt. I have abused the\nconfidence and generosity of my patron; I have defrauded his family,\nunder the mask of sincerity and attachment; I have taken the most cruel\nand base advantages of virtue in distress; I have seduced unsuspecting\ninnocence to ruin and despair; I have violated the most sacred trust\nreposed in me by my friend and benefactor; I have betrayed his love,\ntorn his noble heart asunder, by means of the most perfidious slander\nand false insinuations; and, finally, brought to an untimely grave the\nfairest pattern of human beauty and perfection. Shall the author of\nthese crimes pass with impunity? Shall he hope to prosper in the midst\nof such enormous guilt? It were an imputation upon Providence to\nsuppose it! Ah, no!

Thus determined, he packed up his\nnecessaries in a portmanteau, attempted to amuse his creditors with\npromises of speedy payment, and, venturing to come forth in the dark,\ntook a place in the Canterbury stage-coach, after having converted his\nsuperfluities into ready money. These steps were not taken with such\nprivacy as to elude the vigilance of his adversaries; for, although he\nhad been cautious enough to transport himself and his baggage to the\ninn on Sunday evening, and never doubted that the vehicle, which set\nout at four o’clock on Monday morning, would convey him out of the\nreach of his creditors, before they could possibly obtain a writ for\nsecuring his person, they had actually taken such precautions as\nfrustrated all his finesse; and the coach being stopped in the borough\nof Southwark, Doctor Fathom was seized by virtue of a warrant obtained\non a criminal indictment, and was forthwith conducted to the prison of\nthe King’s Bench; yet, not before he had, by his pathetic\nremonstrances, excited the compassion, and even drawn tears from the\neyes of his fellow-passengers.He no sooner recollected himself from the shock which must have been\noccasioned by this sinister incident, than he despatched a letter to\nhis brother-in-law, the counsellor, requesting an immediate conference,\nin which he promised to make such a proposal as would save him all the\nexpense of a lawsuit and trial, and, at the same time, effectually\nanswer all the purposes of both. He was accordingly favoured with a\nvisit from the lawyer, to whom, after the most solemn protestations of\nhis own innocence, he declared, that, finding himself unable to wage\nwar against such powerful antagonists, he had resolved even to abandon\nhis indubitable right, and retire into another country, in order to\nscreen himself from persecution, and remove all cause of disquiet from\nthe prosecutrix, when he was, unfortunately, prevented by the warrant\nwhich had been executed against him. He said he was still willing, for\nthe sake of his liberty, to sign a formal renunciation of his\npretensions to Mrs. Fathom and her fortune, provided the deeds could be\nexecuted, and the warrant withdrawn, before he should be detained by\nhis other creditors; and, lastly, he conjured the barrister to spare\nhimself the guilt and the charge of suborning evidence for the\ndestruction of an unhappy man, whose misfortune was his only fault."

Next day, he returned with an order to release our hero,\nwho, being formally discharged, was conducted by the lawyer to a tavern\nin the neighbourhood, where the releases were exchanged, and everything\nconcluded with amity and concord. This business being happily\ntransacted, Fathom stept into a hackney-coach, with his baggage, and\nwas followed by a bailiff, who told him, with great composure, that he\nwas again a prisoner, at the suit of Doctor Buffalo, and desired the\ncoachman to reconduct him to the lodging he had so lately discharged.Fathom, whose fortitude had been hitherto of the pagan temper, was now\nfain to reinforce it with the philosophy of Christian resignation,\nthough he had not as yet arrived to such a pitch of self-denial as to\nforgive the counsellor, to whose double dealing he imputed this new\ncalamity. After having received the compliments of the jailer on his\nrecommitment, he took pen, ink, and paper, and composed an artful and\naffecting epistle to the empiric, imploring his mercy, flattering his\nweakness, and demonstrating the bad policy of cooping up an unhappy man\nin a jail, where he could never have an opportunity of doing justice to\nhis creditors; nor did he forget to declare his intention of retiring\ninto another country, where he might have some chance of earning a\nsubsistence, which he had so long toiled for to no purpose in England.\nThis last declaration he made in consequence of the jealous disposition\nof the quack, who he knew had long looked upon him in the odious light\nof an interloping rival.

  "content": "But now it is high time to leave our adventurer to chew the cud of\nreflection and remorse in this solitary mansion, that we may trace\nRenaldo in the several steps he took to assert his right, and do\njustice to his family. Never man indulged a more melancholy train of\nideas than that which accompanied him in his journey to the Imperial\ncourt. For, notwithstanding the manifold reasons he had to expect a\nhappy issue to his aim, his imagination was incessantly infected with\nsomething that chilled his nerves and saddened his heart, recurring,\nwith quick succession, like the unwearied wave that beats upon the\nbleak, inhospitable Greenland shore. This, the reader will easily\nsuppose, was no other than the remembrance of the forlorn Monimia,\nwhose image appeared to his fancy in different attitudes, according to\nthe prevalence of the passions which raged in his bosom. Sometimes he\nviewed her in the light of apostasy, and then his soul was maddened\nwith indignation and despair. But these transitory blasts were not able\nto efface the impressions she had formerly made upon his heart;\nimpressions which he had so often and so long contemplated with\ninconceivable rapture. These pictures still remained, representing her\nfair as the most perfect idea of beauty, soft and tender as an angel of\nmercy and compassion, warmed with every virtue of the heart, and\nadorned with every accomplishment of human nature. Yet the alarming\ncontrast came still in the rear of this recollection; so that his soul\nwas by turns agitated by the tempests of horror, and overwhelmed by the\nfloods of grief.He recalled the moment on which he first beheld her, with that pleasing\nregret which attends the memory of a dear deceased friend. Then he\nbitterly cursed it, as the source of all his misfortunes and\naffliction. He thanked Heaven for having blessed him with a friend to\ndetect her perfidy and ingratitude; and then ardently wished he had\nstill continued under the influence of her delusion. In a word, the\nloneliness of his situation aggravated every horror of his reflection;\nfor, as he found himself without company, his imagination was never\nsolicited, or his attention diverted from these subjects of woe; and he\ntravelled to Brussels in a reverie, fraught with such torments as must\nhave entirely wrecked his reason, had not Providence interposed in his\nbehalf. He was, by his postillion, conducted to one of the best inns of\nthe place, where he understood the cloth was already laid for supper;\nand as the ordinary is open to strangers in all these houses of\nentertainment, he introduced himself into the company, with a view to\nalleviate, in some measure, his sorrow and chagrin, by the conversation\nof his fellow-guests. Yet he was so ill prepared to obtain the relief\nwhich he courted, that he entered the apartment, and sat down to table,\nwithout distinguishing either the number or countenances of those who\nwere present, though he himself did not long remain so unregarded. His\nmien and deportment produced a prepossession in his favour; and the air\nof affliction, so remarkable in his visage, did not fail to attract\ntheir sympathy and observation."

  "content": "Among the rest, was an Irish officer in the Austrian service, who\nhaving eyed Renaldo attentively, “Sir,” said he, rising, “if my eyes\nand memory do not deceive me, you are the Count de Melvil, with whom I\nhad the honour to serve upon the Rhine during the last war.” The youth,\nhearing his own name mentioned, lifted up his eyes, and at once\nrecognising the other to be a gentleman who had been a captain in his\nfather’s regiment, ran forwards, and embraced him with great affection.This was, in divers respects, a fortunate rencontre for young Melvil;\nas the officer was not only perfectly well acquainted with the\nsituation of the Count’s family, but also resolved, in a few days, to\nset out for Vienna, whither he promised to accompany Renaldo, as soon\nas he understood his route lay the same way. Before the day fixed for\ntheir departure arrived, this gentleman found means to insinuate\nhimself so far into the confidence of the Count, as to learn the cause\nof that distress which he had observed in his features at their first\nmeeting; and being a gentleman of uncommon vivacity, as well as\nsincerely attached to the family of Melvil, to which he had owed his\npromotion, he exerted all his good-humour and good sense in amusing the\nfancy, and reasoning down the mortification of the afflicted Hungarian.\nHe in particular endeavoured to wean his attention from the lost\nMonimia, by engaging it upon his domestic affairs, and upon the wrongs\nof his mother and sister, who, he gave him to understand, were\nlanguishing under the tyranny of his father-in-law.This was a note that effectually roused him from the lethargy of his\nsorrow; and the desire of taking vengeance on the oppressor, who had\nruined his fortune, and made his nearest relations miserable, so\nentirely engrossed his thoughts, as to leave no room for other\nconsiderations. During their journey to Austria, Major Farrel, (that\nwas the name of his fellow-traveller,) informed him of many\ncircumstances touching his father’s house, to which himself was an\nutter stranger."

  "content": "“The conduct of your mother,” said he, “in marrying Count Trebasi, was\nnot at all agreeable either to the friends of the Count de Melvil, or\nto her own relations, who knew her second husband to be a man of a\nviolent temper, and rapacious disposition, which the nature of his\neducation and employment had served rather to inflame than allay; for\nyou well know he was a partisan during the whole course of the late\nwar. They were, moreover, equally surprised and chagrined, when they\nfound she took no step to prevent his seizing upon that inheritance\nwhich of right belonged to you, and which, by the laws of Hungary, is\nunalienable from the heir of blood. Nevertheless, they are now fully\nconvinced, that she hath more than sufficiently atoned for her\nindiscretion, by the barbarity of her husband, who hath not only\nsecluded her from all communication with her friends and acquaintance,\nbut even confined her to the west tower of your father’s house, where\nshe is said to be kept close prisoner, and subjected to all sorts of\ninconvenience and mortification. This severity she is believed to have\nincurred in consequence of having expostulated to him upon his unjust\nbehaviour to you and Mademoiselle, whom he hath actually shut up in\nsome convent in Vienna, which your relations have not as yet been able\nto discover. But the memory of your noble father is so dear to all\nthose who were favoured with his friendship, and the sufferings of the\nCountess and Mademoiselle have raised such a spirit of resentment\nagainst her cruel jailor, that nothing is wanted but your presence to\nbegin the prosecution, and give a sanction to the measures of your\nfriends, which will in a little time restore your family to the\nfruition of its rights and fortune. For my own part, my dear Count, I\nconsider myself as one wholly indebted to your house for the rank and\nexpectation I now enjoy; and my finances, interest, and person, such as\nthey are, I dedicate to your service.”Renaldo was not slow in making his acknowledgments to this generous\nHibernian, whom he informed of his scheme, recounting to him his\nuncommon transaction with the benevolent Jew, and communicating the\nletters of recommendation he had received by his means to some of the\nfirst noblemen at the Imperial court. Meanwhile, he burned with\nimpatience to chastise Count Trebasi for his perfidious conduct to the\nwidow and the fatherless, and would have taken the road to Presburg,\nwithout touching at Vienna, in order to call him to a severe account,\nhad not he been strenuously opposed by Major Farrel, who represented\nthe imprudence of taking such a step before he had secured a proper\nprotection from the consequences with which it might be attended.“It is not,” said he, “your own life and fortune only which depend upon\nyour behaviour in this emergency, but also the quiet and happiness of\nthose who are most dear to your affection. Not you alone, but likewise\nyour mother and sister, would infallibly suffer by your temerity and\nprecipitation. First of all, deliver your credentials at court, and let\nus join our endeavours to raise an interest strong enough to\ncounterbalance that of Trebasi. If we succeed, there will be no\nnecessity for having recourse to personal measures. He will be\ncompelled to yield up your inheritance which he unjustly detains, and\nto restore your sister to your arms; and if he afterwards refuses to do\njustice to the Countess, you will always have it in your power to\nevince yourself the son of the brave Count de Melvil.”"

He heard his complaints with great patience and\naffability, assured him of his assistance and protection, and even\nundertook to introduce him to the empress-queen, who would not suffer\nthe weakest of her subjects to be oppressed, much less disregard the\ncause of an injured young nobleman, who, by his own services, and those\nof his family, was peculiarly entitled to her favour.Nor was he the only person whose countenance and patronage Melvil\nsolicited upon this occasion; he visited all the friends of his father,\nand all his mother’s relations, who were easily interested in his\nbehalf; while Major Farrel contributed all his efforts in strengthening\nthe association. So that a lawsuit was immediately commenced against\nCount Trebasi, who on his side was not idle, but prepared with\nincredible industry for the assault, resolving to maintain with his\nwhole power the acquisition he had made.The laws of Hungary, like those of some other countries I could name,\nafford so many subterfuges for the purposes of perfidy and fraud, that\nit is no wonder our youth began to complain of the slow progress of his\naffair; especially as he glowed with the most eager desire of\nredressing the grievances of his parent and sister, whose sufferings he\ndid not doubt were doubled since the institution of his process against\ntheir tormentor. He imparted his sentiments on this head to his friend;\nand, as his apprehensions every moment increased, plainly told him he\ncould no longer live without making some effort to see those with whom\nhe was so nearly connected in point of blood and affection. He\ntherefore resolved to repair immediately to Presburg; and, according to\nthe intelligence he should procure, essay to see and converse with his\nmother, though at the hazard of his life.CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHTRENALDO ABRIDGES THE PROCEEDINGS AT LAW, AND APPROVES HIMSELF THE SON\nOF HIS FATHER."

Here they were informed that Count Trebasi’s\ncastle was altogether inaccessible; that all the servants who were\nsupposed to have the least veneration or compassion for the Countess\nwere dismissed; and that, since Renaldo was known to be in Germany, the\nvigilance and caution of that cruel husband was redoubled to such a\ndegree, that nobody knew whether his unfortunate lady was actually\nalive or dead.Farrel perceiving Melvil exceedingly affected with this intimation, and\nhearing him declare that he would never quit Presburg until he should\nhave entered the house, and removed his doubts on that interesting\nsubject, not only argued with great vehemence against such an attempt,\nas equally dangerous and indiscreet, but solemnly swore he would\nprevent his purpose, by discovering his design to the family, unless he\nwould promise to listen to a more moderate and feasible expedient. He\nthen proposed that he himself should appear in the equipage of one of\nthe travelling Savoyards who stroll about Europe, amusing ignorant\npeople with the effects of a magic lanthorn, and in that disguise\nendeavour to obtain admittance from the servants of Trebasi, among whom\nhe might make such inquiries as would deliver Melvil from his present\nuneasy suspense."

So far his stratagem\nsucceeded; he had not long stood in waiting before he was invited into\nthe court-yard, where the servants formed a ring, and danced to the\nefforts of his companion’s skill; then he was conducted into the\nbuttery, where he exhibited his figures on the wall, and his princess\non the floor; and while they regaled him in this manner with scraps and\nsour wine, he took occasion to inquire about the old lady and her\ndaughter, before whom he said he had performed in his last\nperegrination. Though this question was asked with all that air of\nsimplicity which is peculiar to these people, one of the domestics took\nthe alarm, being infected with the suspicions of his master, and\nplainly taxed the Major with being a spy, threatening at the same time\nthat he should be stripped and searched.This would have been a very dangerous experiment for the Hibernian, who\nhad actually in his pocket a letter to the Countess from her son, which\nhe hoped fortune might have furnished him with an opportunity to\ndeliver. When he therefore found himself in this dilemma, he was not at\nall easy in his own mind. However, instead of protesting his innocence\nin an humble and beseeching strain, in order to acquit himself of the\ncharge, he resolved to elude the suspicion by provoking the wrath of\nhis accuser, and, putting on the air of vulgar integrity affronted,\nbegan to reproach the servant in very insolent terms for his unfair\nsupposition, and undressed himself in a moment to the skin, threw his\ntattered garments in the face of his adversary, telling him he would\nfind nothing there which he would not be very glad to part with; at the\nsame time raising his voice, he, in the gibberish of the clan he\nrepresented, scolded and cursed with great fluency, so that the whole\nhouse resounded with the noise. The valet’s jealousy, like a smaller\nfire, was in a trice swallowed up in the greater flame of his rage\nenkindled by this abrupt address. In consequence of which, Farrel was\nkicked out at the gate, naked as he was to the waist, after his\nlanthorn had been broke to pieces on his head; and there he was joined\nby his domestic, who had not been able to recover his apparel and\neffect a retreat, without incurring marks of the same sort of\ndistinction.The Major, considering the risk he must have run in being detected,\nthought himself cheaply quit for this moderate discipline, though he\nwas really concerned for his friend Renaldo, who, understanding the\nparticulars of the adventure, determined, as the last effort, to ride\nround the castle in the open day, on pretence of taking the air, when,\nperadventure, the Countess would see him from the place of her\nconfinement, and favour him with some mark or token of her being alive."

Having made a\nsmall excursion in the adjoining fields, they drew nearer the walls,\nand at an easy pace had twice circled them, when Farrel descried, at\nthe top of a tower, a white handkerchief waved by a woman’s hand\nthrough the iron bars that secured the window. This signal being\npointed out to Renaldo, his heart began to throb with great violence;\nhe made a respectful obeisance towards the part in which it appeared,\nand perceiving the hand beckoning him to approach, advanced to the very\nbuttress of the turret; upon which, seeing something drop, he alighted\nwith great expedition, and took up a picture of his father in\nminiature, the features of which he no sooner distinguished, than the\ntears ran down his cheeks; he pressed the little image to his lips with\nthe most filial fervour; then conveying it to his bosom, looked up to\nthe hand, which waved in such a manner as gave him to understand it was\nhigh time to retire. Being by this time highly persuaded that his kind\nmonitor was no other than the Countess herself, he pointed to his\nheart, in token of his filial affection, and laying his hand on his\nsword, to denote his resolution of doing her justice, he took his leave\nwith another profound bow, and suffered himself to be reconducted to\nhis lodging."

Alarmed at this information, from\nwhich he immediately concluded that the stranger was young Melvil, he\nforthwith quitted the chase, and returning to the castle by a private\npostern, ordered his horse to be kept ready saddled, in hope that his\nson-in-law would repeat the visit to his mother. This precaution would\nhave been to no purpose, had Renaldo followed the advice of Farrel, who\nrepresented the danger of returning to a place where the alarm was\nundoubtedly given by his first appearance; and exhorted him to return\nto Vienna for the prosecution of his suit, now that he was satisfied of\nhis mother’s being alive. In order to strengthen this admonition, he\nbade him recollect the signal for withdrawing, which was doubtless the\neffect of maternal concern, inspired by the knowledge of the Count’s\nvigilance and vindictive disposition.Notwithstanding these suggestions, Melvil persisted in his resolution\nof appearing once more below the tower, on the supposition that his\nmother, in expectation of his return, had prepared a billet for his\nacceptance, from which he might obtain important intelligence. The\nMajor, seeing him lend a deaf ear to his remonstrances, was contented\nto attend him in his second expedition, which he pressed him to\nundertake that same afternoon, as Trebasi had taken care to circulate a\nreport of his having gone to dine at the seat of a nobleman in the\nneighbourhood. Our knight-errant and his squire, deceived by this\nfinesse, presented themselves again under the prison of the Countess,\nwho no sooner beheld her son return, than she earnestly entreated him\nto be gone, by the same sign which she had before used; and he, taking\nit for granted that she was debarred the use of pen, ink, and paper,\nand that she had nothing more to expect, consented to retire, and had\nalready moved to some distance from the house, when, in crossing a\nsmall plantation that belonged to the castle, they were met by Count\nTrebasi and another person on horseback.At sight of this apparition, the blood mounted into Renaldo’s cheeks,\nand his eyes began to lighten with eagerness and indignation; which was\nnot at all diminished by the ferocious address of the Count, who\nadvancing to Melvil, with a menacing air. “Before you proceed,” said\nhe, “I must know with what view you have been twice to-day patroling\nround my enclosures, and reconnoitring the different avenues of my\nhouse. You likewise carry on a clandestine correspondence with some\nperson in the family, of which my honour obliges me to demand an\nexplanation.”"
