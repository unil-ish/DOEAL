  "content": "The lawyer felt the force of his expostulations; and though he would by\nno means suppose him innocent of the charge of bigamy, yet, under the\npretext of humanity and commiseration, he undertook to persuade his\nsister to accept of a proper release, which, he observed, would not be\nbinding, if executed during the confinement of Fathom; he therefore\ntook his leave, in order to prepare the papers, withdraw the action,\nand take such other measures as would hinder the prisoner from giving\nhim the slip. Next day, he returned with an order to release our hero,\nwho, being formally discharged, was conducted by the lawyer to a tavern\nin the neighbourhood, where the releases were exchanged, and everything\nconcluded with amity and concord. This business being happily\ntransacted, Fathom stept into a hackney-coach, with his baggage, and\nwas followed by a bailiff, who told him, with great composure, that he\nwas again a prisoner, at the suit of Doctor Buffalo, and desired the\ncoachman to reconduct him to the lodging he had so lately discharged.Fathom, whose fortitude had been hitherto of the pagan temper, was now\nfain to reinforce it with the philosophy of Christian resignation,\nthough he had not as yet arrived to such a pitch of self-denial as to\nforgive the counsellor, to whose double dealing he imputed this new\ncalamity. After having received the compliments of the jailer on his\nrecommitment, he took pen, ink, and paper, and composed an artful and\naffecting epistle to the empiric, imploring his mercy, flattering his\nweakness, and demonstrating the bad policy of cooping up an unhappy man\nin a jail, where he could never have an opportunity of doing justice to\nhis creditors; nor did he forget to declare his intention of retiring\ninto another country, where he might have some chance of earning a\nsubsistence, which he had so long toiled for to no purpose in England.\nThis last declaration he made in consequence of the jealous disposition\nof the quack, who he knew had long looked upon him in the odious light\nof an interloping rival. However, he reaped no benefit from this\nsupplication, which served only to gratify the pride of Buffalo, who\nproduced the extravagant encomiums which Fathom had bestowed upon him,\nas so many testimonials of his foe’s bearing witness to his virtue.CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVENFATHOM BEING SAFELY HOUSED, THE READER IS ENTERTAINED WITH A\nRETROSPECT."

  "content": "But now it is high time to leave our adventurer to chew the cud of\nreflection and remorse in this solitary mansion, that we may trace\nRenaldo in the several steps he took to assert his right, and do\njustice to his family. Never man indulged a more melancholy train of\nideas than that which accompanied him in his journey to the Imperial\ncourt. For, notwithstanding the manifold reasons he had to expect a\nhappy issue to his aim, his imagination was incessantly infected with\nsomething that chilled his nerves and saddened his heart, recurring,\nwith quick succession, like the unwearied wave that beats upon the\nbleak, inhospitable Greenland shore. This, the reader will easily\nsuppose, was no other than the remembrance of the forlorn Monimia,\nwhose image appeared to his fancy in different attitudes, according to\nthe prevalence of the passions which raged in his bosom. Sometimes he\nviewed her in the light of apostasy, and then his soul was maddened\nwith indignation and despair. But these transitory blasts were not able\nto efface the impressions she had formerly made upon his heart;\nimpressions which he had so often and so long contemplated with\ninconceivable rapture. These pictures still remained, representing her\nfair as the most perfect idea of beauty, soft and tender as an angel of\nmercy and compassion, warmed with every virtue of the heart, and\nadorned with every accomplishment of human nature. Yet the alarming\ncontrast came still in the rear of this recollection; so that his soul\nwas by turns agitated by the tempests of horror, and overwhelmed by the\nfloods of grief.He recalled the moment on which he first beheld her, with that pleasing\nregret which attends the memory of a dear deceased friend. Then he\nbitterly cursed it, as the source of all his misfortunes and\naffliction. He thanked Heaven for having blessed him with a friend to\ndetect her perfidy and ingratitude; and then ardently wished he had\nstill continued under the influence of her delusion. In a word, the\nloneliness of his situation aggravated every horror of his reflection;\nfor, as he found himself without company, his imagination was never\nsolicited, or his attention diverted from these subjects of woe; and he\ntravelled to Brussels in a reverie, fraught with such torments as must\nhave entirely wrecked his reason, had not Providence interposed in his\nbehalf. He was, by his postillion, conducted to one of the best inns of\nthe place, where he understood the cloth was already laid for supper;\nand as the ordinary is open to strangers in all these houses of\nentertainment, he introduced himself into the company, with a view to\nalleviate, in some measure, his sorrow and chagrin, by the conversation\nof his fellow-guests. Yet he was so ill prepared to obtain the relief\nwhich he courted, that he entered the apartment, and sat down to table,\nwithout distinguishing either the number or countenances of those who\nwere present, though he himself did not long remain so unregarded. His\nmien and deportment produced a prepossession in his favour; and the air\nof affliction, so remarkable in his visage, did not fail to attract\ntheir sympathy and observation."

  "content": "Among the rest, was an Irish officer in the Austrian service, who\nhaving eyed Renaldo attentively, “Sir,” said he, rising, “if my eyes\nand memory do not deceive me, you are the Count de Melvil, with whom I\nhad the honour to serve upon the Rhine during the last war.” The youth,\nhearing his own name mentioned, lifted up his eyes, and at once\nrecognising the other to be a gentleman who had been a captain in his\nfather’s regiment, ran forwards, and embraced him with great affection.This was, in divers respects, a fortunate rencontre for young Melvil;\nas the officer was not only perfectly well acquainted with the\nsituation of the Count’s family, but also resolved, in a few days, to\nset out for Vienna, whither he promised to accompany Renaldo, as soon\nas he understood his route lay the same way. Before the day fixed for\ntheir departure arrived, this gentleman found means to insinuate\nhimself so far into the confidence of the Count, as to learn the cause\nof that distress which he had observed in his features at their first\nmeeting; and being a gentleman of uncommon vivacity, as well as\nsincerely attached to the family of Melvil, to which he had owed his\npromotion, he exerted all his good-humour and good sense in amusing the\nfancy, and reasoning down the mortification of the afflicted Hungarian.\nHe in particular endeavoured to wean his attention from the lost\nMonimia, by engaging it upon his domestic affairs, and upon the wrongs\nof his mother and sister, who, he gave him to understand, were\nlanguishing under the tyranny of his father-in-law.This was a note that effectually roused him from the lethargy of his\nsorrow; and the desire of taking vengeance on the oppressor, who had\nruined his fortune, and made his nearest relations miserable, so\nentirely engrossed his thoughts, as to leave no room for other\nconsiderations. During their journey to Austria, Major Farrel, (that\nwas the name of his fellow-traveller,) informed him of many\ncircumstances touching his father’s house, to which himself was an\nutter stranger."

  "content": "“The conduct of your mother,” said he, “in marrying Count Trebasi, was\nnot at all agreeable either to the friends of the Count de Melvil, or\nto her own relations, who knew her second husband to be a man of a\nviolent temper, and rapacious disposition, which the nature of his\neducation and employment had served rather to inflame than allay; for\nyou well know he was a partisan during the whole course of the late\nwar. They were, moreover, equally surprised and chagrined, when they\nfound she took no step to prevent his seizing upon that inheritance\nwhich of right belonged to you, and which, by the laws of Hungary, is\nunalienable from the heir of blood. Nevertheless, they are now fully\nconvinced, that she hath more than sufficiently atoned for her\nindiscretion, by the barbarity of her husband, who hath not only\nsecluded her from all communication with her friends and acquaintance,\nbut even confined her to the west tower of your father’s house, where\nshe is said to be kept close prisoner, and subjected to all sorts of\ninconvenience and mortification. This severity she is believed to have\nincurred in consequence of having expostulated to him upon his unjust\nbehaviour to you and Mademoiselle, whom he hath actually shut up in\nsome convent in Vienna, which your relations have not as yet been able\nto discover. But the memory of your noble father is so dear to all\nthose who were favoured with his friendship, and the sufferings of the\nCountess and Mademoiselle have raised such a spirit of resentment\nagainst her cruel jailor, that nothing is wanted but your presence to\nbegin the prosecution, and give a sanction to the measures of your\nfriends, which will in a little time restore your family to the\nfruition of its rights and fortune. For my own part, my dear Count, I\nconsider myself as one wholly indebted to your house for the rank and\nexpectation I now enjoy; and my finances, interest, and person, such as\nthey are, I dedicate to your service.”Renaldo was not slow in making his acknowledgments to this generous\nHibernian, whom he informed of his scheme, recounting to him his\nuncommon transaction with the benevolent Jew, and communicating the\nletters of recommendation he had received by his means to some of the\nfirst noblemen at the Imperial court. Meanwhile, he burned with\nimpatience to chastise Count Trebasi for his perfidious conduct to the\nwidow and the fatherless, and would have taken the road to Presburg,\nwithout touching at Vienna, in order to call him to a severe account,\nhad not he been strenuously opposed by Major Farrel, who represented\nthe imprudence of taking such a step before he had secured a proper\nprotection from the consequences with which it might be attended.“It is not,” said he, “your own life and fortune only which depend upon\nyour behaviour in this emergency, but also the quiet and happiness of\nthose who are most dear to your affection. Not you alone, but likewise\nyour mother and sister, would infallibly suffer by your temerity and\nprecipitation. First of all, deliver your credentials at court, and let\nus join our endeavours to raise an interest strong enough to\ncounterbalance that of Trebasi. If we succeed, there will be no\nnecessity for having recourse to personal measures. He will be\ncompelled to yield up your inheritance which he unjustly detains, and\nto restore your sister to your arms; and if he afterwards refuses to do\njustice to the Countess, you will always have it in your power to\nevince yourself the son of the brave Count de Melvil.”"

  "content": "These just and salutary representations had a due effect upon Renaldo,\nwho no sooner arrived at the capital of Austria, than he waited upon a\ncertain prince of distinction, to whose patronage he was commended; and\nfrom whom he met with a very cordial reception, not only on account of\nhis credentials, but also for the sake of his father, who was well\nknown to his highness. He heard his complaints with great patience and\naffability, assured him of his assistance and protection, and even\nundertook to introduce him to the empress-queen, who would not suffer\nthe weakest of her subjects to be oppressed, much less disregard the\ncause of an injured young nobleman, who, by his own services, and those\nof his family, was peculiarly entitled to her favour.Nor was he the only person whose countenance and patronage Melvil\nsolicited upon this occasion; he visited all the friends of his father,\nand all his mother’s relations, who were easily interested in his\nbehalf; while Major Farrel contributed all his efforts in strengthening\nthe association. So that a lawsuit was immediately commenced against\nCount Trebasi, who on his side was not idle, but prepared with\nincredible industry for the assault, resolving to maintain with his\nwhole power the acquisition he had made.The laws of Hungary, like those of some other countries I could name,\nafford so many subterfuges for the purposes of perfidy and fraud, that\nit is no wonder our youth began to complain of the slow progress of his\naffair; especially as he glowed with the most eager desire of\nredressing the grievances of his parent and sister, whose sufferings he\ndid not doubt were doubled since the institution of his process against\ntheir tormentor. He imparted his sentiments on this head to his friend;\nand, as his apprehensions every moment increased, plainly told him he\ncould no longer live without making some effort to see those with whom\nhe was so nearly connected in point of blood and affection. He\ntherefore resolved to repair immediately to Presburg; and, according to\nthe intelligence he should procure, essay to see and converse with his\nmother, though at the hazard of his life.CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHTRENALDO ABRIDGES THE PROCEEDINGS AT LAW, AND APPROVES HIMSELF THE SON\nOF HIS FATHER."

  "content": "The Major, finding him determined, insisted upon attending him in this\nexpedition, and they set out together for Presburg, where they\nprivately arrived in the dark, resolving to keep themselves concealed\nat the house of a friend, until they should have formed some plan for\ntheir future operations. Here they were informed that Count Trebasi’s\ncastle was altogether inaccessible; that all the servants who were\nsupposed to have the least veneration or compassion for the Countess\nwere dismissed; and that, since Renaldo was known to be in Germany, the\nvigilance and caution of that cruel husband was redoubled to such a\ndegree, that nobody knew whether his unfortunate lady was actually\nalive or dead.Farrel perceiving Melvil exceedingly affected with this intimation, and\nhearing him declare that he would never quit Presburg until he should\nhave entered the house, and removed his doubts on that interesting\nsubject, not only argued with great vehemence against such an attempt,\nas equally dangerous and indiscreet, but solemnly swore he would\nprevent his purpose, by discovering his design to the family, unless he\nwould promise to listen to a more moderate and feasible expedient. He\nthen proposed that he himself should appear in the equipage of one of\nthe travelling Savoyards who stroll about Europe, amusing ignorant\npeople with the effects of a magic lanthorn, and in that disguise\nendeavour to obtain admittance from the servants of Trebasi, among whom\nhe might make such inquiries as would deliver Melvil from his present\nuneasy suspense."

  "content": "This proposal was embraced, though reluctantly, by Renaldo, who was\nunwilling to expose his friend to the least danger or disgrace; and the\nMajor being next day provided with the habit and implements of his new\nprofession, together with a ragged attendant who preceded him,\nextorting music from a paltry viol, approached the castle gate, and\nproclaimed his show so naturally in a yell, partaking of the scream of\nSavoy and the howl of Ireland, that one would have imagined he had been\nconductor to Madam Catherina from his cradle. So far his stratagem\nsucceeded; he had not long stood in waiting before he was invited into\nthe court-yard, where the servants formed a ring, and danced to the\nefforts of his companion’s skill; then he was conducted into the\nbuttery, where he exhibited his figures on the wall, and his princess\non the floor; and while they regaled him in this manner with scraps and\nsour wine, he took occasion to inquire about the old lady and her\ndaughter, before whom he said he had performed in his last\nperegrination. Though this question was asked with all that air of\nsimplicity which is peculiar to these people, one of the domestics took\nthe alarm, being infected with the suspicions of his master, and\nplainly taxed the Major with being a spy, threatening at the same time\nthat he should be stripped and searched.This would have been a very dangerous experiment for the Hibernian, who\nhad actually in his pocket a letter to the Countess from her son, which\nhe hoped fortune might have furnished him with an opportunity to\ndeliver. When he therefore found himself in this dilemma, he was not at\nall easy in his own mind. However, instead of protesting his innocence\nin an humble and beseeching strain, in order to acquit himself of the\ncharge, he resolved to elude the suspicion by provoking the wrath of\nhis accuser, and, putting on the air of vulgar integrity affronted,\nbegan to reproach the servant in very insolent terms for his unfair\nsupposition, and undressed himself in a moment to the skin, threw his\ntattered garments in the face of his adversary, telling him he would\nfind nothing there which he would not be very glad to part with; at the\nsame time raising his voice, he, in the gibberish of the clan he\nrepresented, scolded and cursed with great fluency, so that the whole\nhouse resounded with the noise. The valet’s jealousy, like a smaller\nfire, was in a trice swallowed up in the greater flame of his rage\nenkindled by this abrupt address. In consequence of which, Farrel was\nkicked out at the gate, naked as he was to the waist, after his\nlanthorn had been broke to pieces on his head; and there he was joined\nby his domestic, who had not been able to recover his apparel and\neffect a retreat, without incurring marks of the same sort of\ndistinction.The Major, considering the risk he must have run in being detected,\nthought himself cheaply quit for this moderate discipline, though he\nwas really concerned for his friend Renaldo, who, understanding the\nparticulars of the adventure, determined, as the last effort, to ride\nround the castle in the open day, on pretence of taking the air, when,\nperadventure, the Countess would see him from the place of her\nconfinement, and favour him with some mark or token of her being alive."

  "content": "Though his companion did not much relish this plan, which he foresaw\nwould expose him to the insults of Trebasi, yet, as he could not\ncontrive a better, he acquiesced in Renaldo’s invention, with the\nproviso that he would defer the execution of it until his father-in-law\nshould be absent in the chase, which was a diversion he every day\nenjoyed.Accordingly they set a proper watch, and lay concealed until they were\ninformed of Trebasi’s having gone forth; when they mounted their\nhorses, and rode into the neighbourhood of the castle. Having made a\nsmall excursion in the adjoining fields, they drew nearer the walls,\nand at an easy pace had twice circled them, when Farrel descried, at\nthe top of a tower, a white handkerchief waved by a woman’s hand\nthrough the iron bars that secured the window. This signal being\npointed out to Renaldo, his heart began to throb with great violence;\nhe made a respectful obeisance towards the part in which it appeared,\nand perceiving the hand beckoning him to approach, advanced to the very\nbuttress of the turret; upon which, seeing something drop, he alighted\nwith great expedition, and took up a picture of his father in\nminiature, the features of which he no sooner distinguished, than the\ntears ran down his cheeks; he pressed the little image to his lips with\nthe most filial fervour; then conveying it to his bosom, looked up to\nthe hand, which waved in such a manner as gave him to understand it was\nhigh time to retire. Being by this time highly persuaded that his kind\nmonitor was no other than the Countess herself, he pointed to his\nheart, in token of his filial affection, and laying his hand on his\nsword, to denote his resolution of doing her justice, he took his leave\nwith another profound bow, and suffered himself to be reconducted to\nhis lodging."

Alarmed at this information, from\nwhich he immediately concluded that the stranger was young Melvil, he\nforthwith quitted the chase, and returning to the castle by a private\npostern, ordered his horse to be kept ready saddled, in hope that his\nson-in-law would repeat the visit to his mother. This precaution would\nhave been to no purpose, had Renaldo followed the advice of Farrel, who\nrepresented the danger of returning to a place where the alarm was\nundoubtedly given by his first appearance; and exhorted him to return\nto Vienna for the prosecution of his suit, now that he was satisfied of\nhis mother’s being alive. In order to strengthen this admonition, he\nbade him recollect the signal for withdrawing, which was doubtless the\neffect of maternal concern, inspired by the knowledge of the Count’s\nvigilance and vindictive disposition.Notwithstanding these suggestions, Melvil persisted in his resolution\nof appearing once more below the tower, on the supposition that his\nmother, in expectation of his return, had prepared a billet for his\nacceptance, from which he might obtain important intelligence. The\nMajor, seeing him lend a deaf ear to his remonstrances, was contented\nto attend him in his second expedition, which he pressed him to\nundertake that same afternoon, as Trebasi had taken care to circulate a\nreport of his having gone to dine at the seat of a nobleman in the\nneighbourhood. Our knight-errant and his squire, deceived by this\nfinesse, presented themselves again under the prison of the Countess,\nwho no sooner beheld her son return, than she earnestly entreated him\nto be gone, by the same sign which she had before used; and he, taking\nit for granted that she was debarred the use of pen, ink, and paper,\nand that she had nothing more to expect, consented to retire, and had\nalready moved to some distance from the house, when, in crossing a\nsmall plantation that belonged to the castle, they were met by Count\nTrebasi and another person on horseback.At sight of this apparition, the blood mounted into Renaldo’s cheeks,\nand his eyes began to lighten with eagerness and indignation; which was\nnot at all diminished by the ferocious address of the Count, who\nadvancing to Melvil, with a menacing air. “Before you proceed,” said\nhe, “I must know with what view you have been twice to-day patroling\nround my enclosures, and reconnoitring the different avenues of my\nhouse. You likewise carry on a clandestine correspondence with some\nperson in the family, of which my honour obliges me to demand an\nexplanation.”"

It is my part, therefore, to expostulate; and, since\nfortune hath favoured me with an opportunity of revenging our wrongs in\nperson, we shall not part until you have learned that the family of the\nCount de Melvil is not to be injured with impunity. Here is no\nadvantage on either side, in point of arms or number; you are better\nmounted than I am, and shall have the choice of the ground on which our\ndifference ought to be brought to a speedy determination.”Trebasi, whose courage was not of the sentimental kind, but purely\nowing to his natural insensibility of danger, instead of concerting\nmeasures coolly for the engagement, or making any verbal reply to this\ndefiance, drew a pistol, without the least hesitation, and fired it at\nthe face of Renaldo, part of whose left eyebrow was carried off by the\nball. Melvil was not slow in returning the compliment, which, as it was\ndeliberate, proved the more decisive. For the shot entering the Count’s\nright breast, made its way to the backbone with such a shock, as struck\nhim to the ground; upon which the other alighted, in order to improve\nthe advantage he had gained."

The Hibernian’s horse being a common\nhireling, and unaccustomed to stand fire, no sooner saw the flash of\nTrebasi’s pistol, than, starting aside, he happened to plunge into a\nhole, and was overturned at the very instant when the hussar’s piece\nwent off, so that no damage ensued to his rider, who, pitching on his\nfeet, flew with great nimbleness to his adversary, then, laying hold on\none leg, dismounted him in a twinkling, and, seizing his throat as he\nlay, would have soon despatched him without the use of firearms, had he\nnot been prevented by his friend Renaldo, who desired him to desist,\nobserving that his vengeance was already satisfied, as the Count seemed\nto be in the agonies of death. The Major was loth to quit his prey, as\nhe thought his aggressor had acted in a treacherous manner; but\nrecollecting that there was no time to lose, because, in all\nprobability, the firing had alarmed the castle, he took his leave of\nthe vanquished hussar, with a couple of hearty kicks, and, mounting his\nhorse, followed Melvil to the house of a gentleman in the\nneighbourhood, who was kinsman to the Countess, and very well disposed\nto grant him a secure retreat, until the troublesome consequences of\nthis rencontre should be overblown.Trebasi, though to the young gentleman he seemed speechless and\ninsensible, had neither lost the use of his reason nor of his tongue,\nbut affected that extremity, in order to avoid any further conversation\nwith the victor. He was one of those people who never think of death\nuntil he knocks at the door, and then earnestly entreat him to excuse\nthem for the present, and be so good as to call another time. The Count\nhad so often escaped unhurt, in the course of his campaigns, that he\nlooked upon himself as invulnerable, and set all danger at defiance.\nThough he had hitherto taken no care of the concerns of his soul, he\nhad a large fund of superstition at bottom; and, when the surgeon, who\nexamined his wound, declared it was mortal, all the terrors of futurity\ntook hold on his imagination, all the misdemeanours of his life\npresented themselves in aggravated colours to his recollection.He implored the spiritual assistance of a good priest in the\nneighbourhood, who, in the discharge of his own conscience, gave him to\nunderstand that he had little mercy to expect, unless he would, as much\nas lay in his power, redress the injuries he had done to his\nfellow-creatures. As nothing lay heavier upon his soul than the cruelty\nand fraud he had practised upon the family of Count Melvil, he\nearnestly besought this charitable clergyman to mediate his pardon with\nthe Countess, and at the same time desired to see Renaldo before his\ndeath, that he might put him in possession of his paternal estate, and\nsolicit his forgiveness for the offence he had given."

  "content": "In order to fill up this tedious interval, he visited his friends at\ncourt, who were rejoiced to hear the happy issue of his excursion to\nPresburg; the prince, who was his particular patron, desired he would\nmake himself perfectly easy with regard to the death of Count Trebasi,\nfor he would take care to represent him in such a light to the\nempress-queen, as would screen him from any danger or prosecution on\nthat account. His highness, moreover, appointed the following day for\nperforming the promise he had made of presenting him to that august\nprincess, and in the meantime prepossessed her so much in his favour,\nthat when he approached her presence, and was announced by his noble\nintroductor, she eyed him with a look of peculiar complacency, saying,\n“I am glad to see you returned to my dominions. Your father was a\ngallant officer, who served our house with equal courage and fidelity;\nand as I understand you tread in his footsteps, you may depend upon my\nfavour and protection.”He was so much overwhelmed with this gracious reception, that, while he\nbowed in silence, the drops of gratitude trickled from his eyes; and\nher imperial majesty was so well pleased with this manifestation of his\nheart, that she immediately gave directions for promoting him to the\ncommand of a troop of horse. Thus fortune seemed willing, and indeed\neager to discharge the debt she owed him for the different calamities\nhe had undergone. And as he looked upon the generous Hebrew to be the\nsole source of his success, he did not fail to make him acquainted with\nthe happy effects of his recommendation and friendship, and to express,\nin the warmest terms, the deep sense he had of his uncommon\nbenevolence, which, by the bye, was still greater, with regard to\nRenaldo, than the reader as yet imagines; for he not only furnished him\nwith money for his present occasions, but also gave him an unlimited\ncredit on a banker in Vienna, to whom one of his letters was directed.The ceremony of the nun’s admission being now performed, and the\nconvent restored to its former quiet, Melvil hastened thither on the\nwings of brotherly affection, and presented his letter to the abbess,\nwho having perused the contents, by which she learned that the family\ndisquiets of Count Trebasi no longer subsisted, and that the bearer was\nthe brother of Mademoiselle, she received him with great politeness,\ncongratulated him on this happy event, and, begging he would excuse her\nstaying with him in the parlour, on pretence of business, withdrew,\nsaying, she would immediately send in a young lady who would console\nhim for her absence. In a few minutes he was joined by his sister, who,\nexpecting nothing less than to see Renaldo, no sooner distinguished his\nfeatures, than she shrieked aloud with surprise, and would have sunk\nupon the floor, had not he supported her in his embrace."

  "content": "Such a sudden apparition of her brother at any time, or in any place,\nafter their long separation, would have strongly affected this sensible\nyoung lady; but to find him so abruptly in a place where she thought\nherself buried from the knowledge of all her relations, occasioned such\ncommotions in her spirits as had well-nigh endangered her reason. For\nit was not till after a considerable pause, that she could talk to him\nwith connexion or coherence. However, as those transports subsided,\nthey entered into a more deliberate and agreeable conversation; in the\ncourse of which, he gradually informed her of what had passed at the\ncastle; and inexpressible was the pleasure she felt in learning that\nher mother was released from captivity, herself restored to freedom,\nand her brother to the possession of his inheritance, by the only means\nto which she had always prayed these blessings might be owing.As she had been treated with uncommon humanity by the abbess, she would\nnot consent to leave the convent until he should be ready to set out\nfor Presburg; so that they dined together with that good lady, and\npassed the afternoon in that mutual communication with which a brother\nand sister may be supposed to entertain themselves on such an occasion.\nShe gave him a detail of the insults and mortifications she had\nsuffered from the brutality of her father-in-law, and told him, that\nher confinement in this monastery was owing to Trebasi having\nintercepted a letter to her from Renaldo, signifying his intention to\nreturn to the empire, in order to assert his own right, and redress his\ngrievances. Then turning the discourse upon the incidents of his\nperegrinations, she in a particular manner inquired about that\nexquisite beauty who had been the innocent source of all his\ndistresses, and upon whose perfections he had often, in his letters to\nhis sister, expatiated with indications of rapture and delight."

  "content": "This inquiry in a moment blew up that scorching flame which had been\nwell-nigh stifled by other necessary avocations. His eyes gleamed, his\ncheeks glowed and grew pale alternately, and his whole frame underwent\nan immediate agitation; which being perceived by Mademoiselle, she\nconcluded that some new calamity was annexed to the name of Monimia,\nand, dreading to rip up a wound which she saw was so ineffectually\nclosed, she for the present suppressed her curiosity and concern, and\nindustriously endeavoured to introduce some less affecting subject of\nconversation. He saw her aim, approved of her discretion, and, joining\nher endeavours, expressed his surprise at her having omitted to signify\nthe least remembrance of her old favourite, Fathom, whom he had left in\nEngland. He had no sooner pronounced this name, than she suffered some\nconfusion in her turn; from which, however, recollecting herself,\n“Brother,” said she, “you must endeavour to forget that wretch, who is\naltogether unworthy of retaining the smallest share of your regard.”Astonished, and indeed angry, at this expression, which he considered\nas the effect of malicious misrepresentation, he gently chid her for\nher credulity in believing the envious aspersion of some person, who\nrepined at the superior virtue of Fathom, whom he affirmed to be an\nhonour to the human species.“Nothing is more easy,” replied the young lady, “than to impose upon a\nperson, who, being himself unconscious of guile, suspects no deceit.\nYou have been a dupe, dear brother, not to the finesse of Fathom, but\nto the sincerity of your own heart. For my own part, I assume no honour\nto my own penetration in having comprehended the villany of that\nimpostor, which was discovered, in more than one instance, by accidents\nI could not possibly foresee.“You must know, that Teresa, who attended me from my childhood, and in\nwhose honesty I reposed such confidence, having disobliged some of the\ninferior servants, was so narrowly watched in all her transactions, as\nto be at last detected in the very act of conveying a piece of plate,\nwhich was actually found concealed among her clothes.“You may guess how much I was astonished when I understood this\ncircumstance. I could not trust to the evidence of my own senses, and\nshould have still believed her innocent, in spite of ocular\ndemonstration, had not she, in the terrors of being tried for felony,\npromised to make a very material discovery to the Countess, provided\nshe would take such measures as would save her life."

  "content": "“This request being complied with, she, in my hearing, opened up such\nan amazing scene of iniquity, baseness, and ingratitude, which had been\nacted by her and Fathom, in order to defraud the family to which they\nwere so much indebted, that I could not have believed the human mind\ncapable of such degeneracy, or that traitor endowed with such\npernicious cunning and dissimulation, had not her tale been congruous,\nconsistent, and distinct, and fraught with circumstances that left no\nroom to doubt the least article of her confession; on consideration of\nwhich she was permitted to go into voluntary exile.”She then explained their combination in all the particulars, as we have\nalready recounted them in their proper place, and finally observed,\nthat the opinion she had hence conceived of Fathom’s character, was\nconfirmed by what she had since learned of his perfidious conduct\ntowards that very nun who had lately taken the veil.Perceiving her brother struck dumb with astonishment, and gaping with\nthe most eager attention, she proceeded to relate the incidents of his\ndouble intrigue with the jeweller’s wife and daughter, as they were\ncommunicated to her by the nun, who was no other than the individual\nWilhelmina. After those rivals had been forsaken by their gallant,\ntheir mutual animosities and chagrin served to whet the attention and\ninvention of each; so that in a little time the whole mystery stood\ndisclosed to both. The mother had discovered the daughter’s\ncorrespondence with Fathom, as we have formerly observed, by means of\nthat unfortunate letter which he unwittingly committed to the charge of\nthe old beldame; and, as soon as she understood he was without the\nreach of all solicitation or prosecution, imparted this billet to her\nhusband, whose fury was so ungovernable, that he had almost sacrificed\nWilhelmina with his own hands, especially when, terrified by his\nthreats and imprecations, she owned that she had bestowed the chain on\nthis perfidious lover. However, this dreadful purpose was prevented,\npartly by the interposition of his wife, whose aim was not the death\nbut immurement of his daughter, and partly by the tears and\nsupplication of the young gentlewoman herself, who protested, that,\nalthough the ceremony of the church had not been performed, she was\ncontracted to Fathom by the most solemn vows, to witness which he\ninvoked all the saints in heaven."

  "content": "The jeweller, upon cooler consideration, was unwilling to lose the last\nspark of hope that glittered among the ruins of his despair, and\nresisted all the importunities of his wife, who pressed him to consult\nthe welfare of his daughter’s soul, in the fond expectation of finding\nsome expedient to lure back the chain and its possessor. In the\nmeantime Wilhelmina was daily and hourly exposed to the mortifying\nanimadversions of her mamma, who, with all the insolence of virtue,\nincessantly upbraided her with the backslidings of her vicious life,\nand exhorted her to reformation and repentance. This continual triumph\nlasted for many months, till at length, a quarrel happening between the\nmother and the gossip at whose house she used to give the rendezvous to\nher admirers, that incensed confidante, in the precipitation of her\nanger, promulgated the history of those secret meetings; and, among the\nrest, her interviews with Fathom were brought to light.The first people who hear news of this sort are generally those to whom\nthey are most unwelcome. The German was soon apprised of his wife’s\nfrailty, and considered the two females of his house as a couple of\ndevils incarnate, sent from hell to exercise his patience. Yet, in the\nmidst of his displeasure, he found matter of consolation, in being\nfurnished with a sufficient reason for parting with his helpmate, who\nhad for many years kept his family in disquiet. He therefore, without\nhazarding a personal conference, sent proposals to her by a friend,\nwhich she did not think proper to reject; and seeing himself restored\nto the dominion of his own house, exerted his sway so tyrannically,\nthat Wilhelmina became weary of her life, and had recourse to the\ncomforts of religion, of which she soon became enamoured, and begged\nher father’s permission to dedicate the rest of her life to the duties\nof devotion. She was accordingly received in this convent, the\nregulations of which were so much to her liking, that she performed the\ntask of probation with pleasure, and voluntarily excluded herself from\nthe vanities of this life. It was here she had contracted an\nacquaintance with Mademoiselle de Melvil, to whom she communicated her\ncomplaints of Fathom, on the supposition that he was related to the\nCount, as he himself had often declared.While the young lady rehearsed the particulars of this detail, Renaldo\nsustained a strange vicissitude of different passions. Surprise,\nsorrow, fear, hope, and indignation raised a most tumultuous conflict\nin his bosom. Monimia rushed upon his imagination in the character of\ninnocence betrayed by the insinuations of treachery. He with horror\nviewed her at the mercy of a villain, who had broken all the ties of\ngratitude and honour."

Have I listened to the voice of a\ntraitor, who hath murdered my peace! who hath torn my heart-strings\nasunder, and perhaps ruined the pattern of all earthly perfection. It\ncannot be. Heaven would not suffer such infernal artifice to take\neffect. The thunder would be levelled against the head of the accursed\nprojector.”From this transport, compared with his agitation when he mentioned\nMonimia, his sister judged that Fathom had been the occasion of a\nbreach between the two lovers; and this conjecture being confirmed by\nthe disjointed answers he made to her interrogations upon the affair,\nshe endeavoured to calm his apprehensions, by representing that he\nwould soon have an opportunity of returning to England, where the\nmisunderstanding might be easily cleared up; and that, in the meantime,\nhe had nothing to fear on account of the person of his mistress, in a\ncountry where individuals were so well protected by the laws and\nconstitution of the realm. At length he suffered himself to be\nflattered with the fond hope of seeing Monimia’s character triumph in\nthe inquiry, of retrieving that lost jewel, and of renewing that\nravishing intercourse and exalted expectation which had been so cruelly\ncut off. He now wished to find Fathom as black as he had been\nexhibited, that Monimia’s apostasy might be numbered among the\nmisrepresentations of his treachery and fraud.His love, which was alike generous and ardent, espoused the cause, and\nhe no longer doubted her constancy and virtue. But when he reflected\nhow her tender heart must have been wrung with anguish at his\nunkindness and cruelty, in leaving her destitute in a foreign land; how\nher sensibility must have been tortured in finding herself altogether\ndependent upon a ruffian, who certainly harboured the most baleful\ndesigns upon her honour; how her life must be endangered both by his\nbarbarity and her own despair—I say, when he reflected on these\ncircumstances, he shuddered with horror and dismay; and that very night\ndespatched a letter to his friend the Jew, entreating him, in the most\npressing manner, to employ all his intelligence in learning the\nsituation of the fair orphan, that she might be protected from the\nvillany of Fathom, until his return to England.CHAPTER SIXTY"

He soothed himself with the prospect of a happy\nreconciliation with the divine Monimia, and his fancy was decoyed from\nevery disagreeable presage by the entertaining conversation of his\nsister, with whom in two days he set out for Presburg, attended by his\nfriend the Major, who had never quitted him since their meeting at\nBrussels. Here they found Count Trebasi entirely rid of the fever which\nhad been occasioned by his wound, and in a fair way of doing well; a\ncircumstance that afforded unspeakable pleasure to Melvil, whose manner\nof thinking was such, as would have made him unhappy, could he have\ncharged himself with the death of his mother’s husband, howsoever\ncriminal he might have been.The Count’s ferocity did not return with his health. His eyes were\nopened by the danger he had incurred, and his sentiments turned in a\nnew channel. He heartily asked pardon of Mademoiselle for the rigorous\nusage she had suffered from the violence of his temper; thanked Renaldo\nfor the seasonable lesson he had administered to him; and not only\ninsisted upon being removed from the castle to a house of his own in\nPresburg, but proffered to make immediate restitution of all the rents\nwhich he had unjustly converted to his own use."

But, before\nhe quitted Presburg, his friend Farrel taking him aside one day,\n“Count,” said he, “will you give me leave to ask, if, by my zeal and\nattachment for you, I have had the good fortune to acquire your\nesteem?” “To doubt that esteem,” replied Renaldo, “were to suspect my\ngratitude and honour, of which I must be utterly destitute before I\nlose the sense of those obligations I owe to your gallantry and\nfriendship—obligations which I long for a proper occasion to repay.”“Well then,” resumed the Major, “I will deal with you like a downright\nSwiss, and point out a method by which you may shift the load of\nobligation from your own shoulders to mine. You know my birth, rank,\nand expectations in the service; but perhaps you do not know, that, as\nmy expense has always unavoidably exceeded my income, I find myself a\nlittle out at elbows in my circumstances, and want to piece them up by\nmatrimony. Of those ladies with whom I think I have any chance of\nsucceeding, Mademoiselle de Melvil seems the best qualified to render\nmy situation happy in all respects. Her fortune is more than sufficient\nto disembarrass my affairs; her good sense will be a seasonable check\nupon my vivacity; her agreeable accomplishments will engage a\ncontinuation of affection and regard. I know my own disposition well\nenough to think I shall become a most dutiful and tractable husband;\nand shall deem myself highly honoured in being more closely united to\nmy dear Count de Melvil, the son and representative of that worthy\nofficer under whom my youth was formed. If you will therefore sanction\nmy claim, I will forthwith begin my approaches, and doubt not, under\nyour auspices, to bring the place to a capitulation.”"
