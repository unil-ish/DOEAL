  "content": "The young lady, who little thought that her papa would have taken her\nat her word, was overwhelmed with confusion and dismay, when she saw\nhim enter the closet; and, had her lover been discovered, would, in all\nprobability, have been the loudest in his reproach, and, perhaps, have\naccused him of an intention to rob the house; but she was altogether\nastonished when she found he had made shift to elude the inquiry of her\nparents, because she could not conceive the possibility of his escaping\nby the window, which was in the third storey, at a prodigious distance\nfrom the ground; and how he should conceal himself in the apartment,\nwas a mystery which she could by no means unfold. Before her father and\nmother retired, she lighted her lamp, on pretence of being afraid to be\nin the dark, after the perturbation of spirits she had undergone; and\nher room was no sooner evacuated of such troublesome visitants, than\nshe secured the doors, and went in quest of her lover.Accordingly, every corner of the closet underwent a new search, and she\ncalled upon his name with a soft voice, which she thought no other\nperson would overhear. But Ferdinand did not think proper to gratify\nher impatience, because he could not judge of the predicament in which\nhe stood by the evidence of all his senses, and would not relinquish\nhis post, until he should be better certified that the coast was clear.\nMeanwhile, his Dulcinea, having performed her inquiry to no purpose,\nimagined there was something preternatural in the circumstance of his\nvanishing so unaccountably, and began to cross herself with great\ndevotion. She returned to her chamber, fixed the lamp in the fireplace,\nand, throwing herself upon the bed, gave way to the suggestions of her\nsuperstition, which were reinforced by the silence that prevailed, and\nthe gloomy glimmering of the light. She reflected upon the trespass she\nhad already committed in her heart, and, in the conjectures of her\nfear, believed that her lover was no other than the devil himself, who\nhad assumed the appearance of Fathom, in order to tempt and seduce her\nvirtue."

Upon which\nFerdinand, foreseeing that her parents would be again alarmed, would\nnot stay to undeceive her and explain himself, but, unlocking the door\nwith great expedition, ran downstairs, and luckily accomplished his\nescape. This was undoubtedly the wisest measure he could have taken;\nfor he had not performed one half of his descent toward the street,\nwhen the German was at his daughter’s bedside, demanding to know the\ncause of her exclamation. She then gave him an account of what she had\nseen, with all the exaggerations of her own fancy, and, after having\nweighed the circumstances of her story, he interpreted the apparition\ninto a thief, who had found means to open the door that communicated\nwith the stair; but, having been scared by Wilhelmina’s shriek, had\nbeen obliged to retreat before he could execute his purpose.Our hero’s spirits were so wofully disturbed by this adventure, that,\nfor a whole week, he felt no inclination to visit his inamorata, and\nwas not without apprehension that the affair had terminated in an\nexplanation very little to his advantage. He was, however, delivered\nfrom this disagreeable suspense, by an accidental meeting with the\njeweller himself, who kindly chid him for his long absence, and\nentertained him in the street with an account of the alarm which his\nfamily had sustained, by a thief who broke into Wilhelmina’s apartment.\nGlad to find his apprehension mistaken, he renewed his correspondence\nwith the family, and, in a little time, found reason to console himself\nfor the jeopardy and panic he had undergone.CHAPTER FOURTEENHE IS REDUCED TO A DREADFUL DILEMMA, IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN ASSIGNATION\nWITH THE WIFE.Nor was his whole care and attention engrossed by the execution of this\nscheme upon the daughter. While he managed his concerns in that quarter\nwith incredible ardour and application, he was not the less\nindefatigable in the prosecution of his design upon the mother-in-law,\nwhich he forwarded with all his art during those opportunities he\nenjoyed in the absence of Wilhelmina, who was frequently called away by\nthe domestic duties of the house. The passions of the jeweller’s wife\nwere in such a state of exaltation, as exempted our hero from the\nrepulses and fatigue attending a long siege."

In a word, matters were quickly\nbrought to such a mutual understanding, that, one evening, while they\namused themselves at lansquenet, Fathom conjured her to give him the\nrendezvous next day at the house of any third person of her own sex, in\nwhose discretion she could confide; and, after a few affected scruples\non her side, which he well knew how to surmount, she complied with his\nrequest, and the circumstances of the appointment were settled\naccordingly. After this treaty, their satisfaction rose to such a\nwarmth, and the conversation became so reciprocally endearing, that our\ngallant expressed his impatience of waiting so long for the\naccomplishment of his wishes, and, with the most eager transport,\nbegged she would, if possible, curtail the term of his expectation,\nthat his brain might not suffer by his standing so many tedious hours\non the giddy verge of rapture.The dame, who was naturally compassionate, sympathised with his\ncondition, and, unable to resist his pathetic supplications, gave him\nto understand that his desire could not be granted, without subjecting\nthem both to some hazard, but that she was disposed to run any risk in\nbehalf of his happiness and peace. After this affectionate preamble,\nshe told him that her husband was then engaged in a quarterly meeting\nof the jewellers, from whence he never failed to return quite\noverwhelmed with wine, tobacco, and the phlegm of his own constitution;\nso that he would fall fast asleep as soon as his head should touch the\npillow, and she be at liberty to entertain the lover without\ninterruption, provided he could find means to deceive the jealous\nvigilance of Wilhelmina, and conceal himself in some corner of the\nhouse, unsuspected and unperceived.Our lover, remembering his adventure with the daughter, would have\nwillingly dispensed with this expedient, and began to repent of the\neagerness with which he had preferred his solicitation; but, seeing\nthere was now no opportunity of retracting with honour, he affected to\nenter heartily into the conversation, and, after much canvassing, it\nwas determined, that, while Wilhelmina was employed in the kitchen, the\nmother should conduct our adventurer to the outer door, where he should\npay the compliment of parting, so as to be overheard by the young lady;\nbut, in the meantime, glide softly into the jeweller’s bedchamber,\nwhich was a place they imagined least liable to the effects of a\ndaughter’s prying disposition, and conceal himself in a large press or\nwardrobe, that stood in one corner of the apartment. The scene was\nimmediately acted with great success, and our hero cooped up in his\ncage, where he waited so long, that his desires began to subside, and\nhis imagination to aggravate the danger of his situation."

What if his frenzy should prompt him\nto search his wife’s chamber for gallants? this would certainly be the\nfirst place to which he would direct his inquiry; or, granting this\nsupposition chimerical, I may be seized with an irresistible\ninclination to cough, before he is oppressed with sleep; he may be\nwaked by the noise I shall make in disengaging myself from this\nembarrassed situation; and, finally, I may find it impracticable to\nretire unseen or unheard, after everything else shall have succeeded to\nmy wish.”These suggestions did not at all contribute to the quiet of our\nadventurer, who, having waited three whole hours in the most\nuncomfortable suspense, heard the jeweller brought into the room in\nthat very condition which his fears had prognosticated. He had, it\nseems, quarrelled over his cups with another tradesman, and received a\nsalutation on the forehead with a candlestick, which not only left an\nignominious and painful mark upon his countenance, but even disordered\nhis brain to a very dangerous degree of delirium; so that, instead of\nallowing himself quietly to be undressed and put to bed by his wife, he\nanswered all her gentle admonitions and caresses with the most\nopprobrious invectives and obstreperous behaviour; and, though he did\nnot tax her with infidelity to his bed, he virulently accused her of\nextravagance and want of economy; observed, her expensive way of living\nwould bring him to a morsel of bread; and unfortunately recollecting\nthe attempt of the supposed thief, started up from his chair, swearing\nby G—’s mother that he would forthwith arm himself with a brace of\npistols, and search every apartment in the house. “That press,” said\nhe, with great vociferation, “may, for aught I know, be the receptacle\nof some ruffian.”"

This address made such an impression upon\nour adventurer, that he had well-nigh obeyed the summons, and burst\nfrom his concealment, in a desperate effort to escape, without being\nrecognised by the intoxicated German; and indeed, had the application\nbeen repeated, he in all likelihood would have tried the experiment,\nfor by this time his terrors had waxed too strong to be much longer\nsuppressed. From this hazardous enterprise he was, however, exempted by\na lucky accident that happened to his disturber, whose head chancing to\npitch upon the corner of a chair in his fall, he was immediately lulled\ninto a trance, during which the considerate lady, guessing the disorder\nof her gallant, and dreading further interruption, very prudently\nreleased him from his confinement, after she had put out the light, and\nin the dark conveyed him to the door, where he was comforted with the\npromise that she would punctually remember the rendezvous of next day.She then invoked the assistance of the servants, who, being waked for\nthe purpose, lifted up their master, and tumbled him into bed, while\nFerdinand hied him home in an universal sweat, blessing himself from\nany future achievement of that sort in a house where he had been twice\nin such imminent danger of life and reputation. Nevertheless, he did\nnot fail to honour the assignation, and avail himself of the\ndisposition his mistress manifested to make him all the recompense in\nher power for the disappointment and chagrin which he had undergone.CHAPTER FIFTEENBUT AT LENGTH SUCCEEDS IN HIS ATTEMPT UPON BOTH.Having thus gained a complete victory over the affections of these two\nladies, he began to convert his good fortune to the purposes of that\nprinciple, from which his view was never, no, not for a moment,\ndetached. In other words, he used them as ministers and purveyors to\nhis avarice and fraud. As for the mother-in-law, she was of herself so\nliberal as to anticipate the wishes of any moderate adventurer, and\npresented him with sundry valuable jewels, as memorials of her esteem;\nnor was the daughter backward in such expressions of regard; she\nalready considered his interest as her own, and took frequent\nopportunities of secreting for his benefit certain stray trinkets that\nshe happened to pick up in her excursions within doors."

Yet, not contented with what he\nthus could earn, and despairing of being able to steer the bark of his\nfortune for any length of time between two such dangerous quicksands,\nhe resolved to profit by the occasion while it lasted, and strike some\nconsiderable stroke at once. A plan was formed in consequence of this\ndetermination, and, at an appointment with the mother in the house of\ntheir female friend, our adventurer appeared with an air of dejection,\nwhich he veiled with a thin cover of forced pleasantry, that his\nmistress might suppose he endeavoured to conceal some mortal chagrin\nthat preyed upon his heart.The stratagem succeeded to his wish. She observed his countenance\nbetween whiles overcast, took notice of the involuntary sighs he\nheaved; and, with the most tender expressions of sympathy, conjured him\nto make her acquainted with the cause of his affliction. Instead of\ngratifying her request immediately, he evaded her questions with a\nrespectful reserve, implying, that his love would not suffer him to\nmake her a partner in his sorrow; and this delicacy on his part whetted\nher impatience and concern to such a degree, that, rather than keep her\nin such an agony of doubt and apprehension, he was prevailed upon to\ntell her, that he had been, the preceding night, engaged with a company\nof his fellow-students, where he had made too free with the champagne,\nso that his caution forsook him, and he had been decoyed into play by a\nTyrolese gamester, who stripped him of all his ready money, and\nobtained from him an obligation for two hundred florins, which he could\nnot possibly pay without having recourse to his relation the Count de\nMelvil, who would have just cause to be incensed at his extravagance.This information he concluded, by declaring that, cost what it would,\nhe was resolved to make a candid confession of the truth, and throw\nhimself entirely upon the generosity of his patron, who could inflict\nno other punishment than that of discarding him from his favour and\nprotection,—a misfortune which, how grievous soever it might be, he\nshould be able to sustain with fortitude, could he fall upon some\nmethod of satisfying the Tyrolese, who was very importunate and savage\nin his demand. His kind mistress no sooner found out the source of his\ninquietude, than she promised to dry it up, assuring him that next day,\nat the same hour, she would enable him to discharge the debt; so that\nhe might set his heart at ease, and recollect that gaiety which was the\nsoul of her enjoyment."

The attachment I have the honour\nto profess for your amiable person, is not founded on such inglorious\nmotives, but is the genuine result of that generous passion which none\nbut the noble-minded feel, and the only circumstance of this misfortune\nthat I dread to encounter, is the necessity of withdrawing myself for\never from the presence of her whose genial smiles could animate my soul\nagainst all the persecution of adverse fortune.”This declamation, accompanied with a profound sigh, served only to\ninflame her desire of extricating him from the difficulty in which he\nwas involved. She exhausted all her eloquence in attempting to persuade\nhim that his refusal was an outrage against her affection. He pretended\nto refute her arguments, and remained unshaken by all the power of her\nsolicitations, until she had recourse to the most passionate\nremonstrances of love, and fell at his feet in the posture of a forlorn\nshepherdess. What he refused to her reason, he granted to her tears,\nbecause his heart was melted by her affliction, and next day\ncondescended to accept of her money, out of pure regard to her\nhappiness and peace.Encouraged by the success of this achievement, he resolved to practise\nthe same experiment upon Wilhelmina, in hope of extracting an equal\nshare of profit from her simplicity and attachment, and, at their very\nnext nocturnal rendezvous in her chamber, reacted the farce already\nrehearsed, with a small variation, which he thought necessary to\nstimulate the young lady in his behalf. He rightly concluded, that she\nwas by no means mistress of such a considerable sum as he had already\nextorted from her mother, and therefore thought proper to represent\nhimself in the most urgent predicament, that her apprehension, on his\naccount, might be so alarmed as to engage her in some enterprise for\nhis advantage, which otherwise she would never have dreamed of\nundertaking. With this view, after having described his own calamitous\nsituation, in consequence of her pressing entreaties, which he affected\nto evade, he gave her to understand, that there was no person upon\nearth to whom he would have recourse in this emergency; for which\nreason he was determined to rid himself of all his cares at once, upon\nthe friendly point of his own faithful sword."

Her grief manifested itself in a flood of tears,\nwhile she hung round his neck, conjuring him in the most melting terms,\nby their mutual love, in which they had been so happy, to lay aside\nthat fatal determination, which would infallibly involve her in the\nsame fate; for, she took Heaven to witness, that she would not one\nmoment survive the knowledge of his death.He was not deficient in expressions of reciprocal regard. He extolled\nher love and tenderness with a most extravagant eulogium, and seemed\nwrung with mortal anguish at the prospect of parting for ever from his\nlovely Wilhelmina; but his honour was a stern and rigid creditor, that\ncould not be appeased, except with his blood; and all the boon she\ncould obtain, by dint of the most woful supplication, was a promise to\ndefer the execution of his baleful purpose for the space of\nfour-and-twenty hours, during which she hoped Heaven would\ncompassionate her sufferings, and inspire her with some contrivance for\ntheir mutual relief. Thus he yielded to her fervent request, rather\nwith a view to calm the present transports of her sorrow, than with any\nexpectation of seeing himself redeemed from his fate by her\ninterposition; such at least were his professions when he took his\nleave, assuring her, that he would not quit his being before he should\nhave devoted a few hours to another interview with the dear object of\nhis love.Having thus kindled the train, he did not doubt that the mine of his\ncraft would take effect, and repaired to his own lodging, in full\npersuasion of seeing his aim accomplished, before the time fixed for\ntheir last assignation.

  "content": "“JEWEL OF MY SOUL!—Scarce had you, last night, quitted my disconsolate\narms, when I happily recollected that there was in my possession a gold\nchain, of value more than sufficient to answer the exigence of your\npresent occasions. It was pledged to my grandfather for two hundred\ncrowns by a knight of Malta, who soon after perished in a sea\nengagement with the enemies of our faith, so that it became the\nproperty of our house, and was bequeathed to me by the old gentleman,\nas a memorial of his particular affection. Upon whom can I more\nproperly bestow it, than him who is already master of my heart! Receive\nit, therefore, from the bearer of this billet, and convert it, without\nscruple, to that use which shall be most conducive to your ease and\nsatisfaction; nor seek, from a true romantic notion of honour, which I\nknow you entertain, to excuse yourself from accepting this testimony of\nmy affection. For I have already sworn before an image of our blessed\nLady, that I will no longer own you as the sovereign of my heart, nor\neven indulge you with another interview, if you reject this mark of\ntenderness and concern from your ever faithful WILHELMINA.”The heart of our adventurer began to bound with joy when he surveyed\nthe contents of this letter; and his eyes sparkled with transport at\nsight of the chain, which he immediately perceived to be worth twice\nthe sum she had mentioned. Nevertheless, he would not avail himself,\nwithout further question, of her generosity; but, that same night,\nrepairing to her apartment at the usual hour of meeting, he prostrated\nhimself before her, and counterfeiting extreme agitation of spirit,\nbegged, in the most urgent terms, not even unaccompanied with tears,\nthat she would take back the present, which he tendered for her\nacceptance, and spare him the most insufferable mortification of\nthinking himself exposed to the imputation of being mercenary in his\nlove. Such, he said, was the delicacy of his passion, that he could not\npossibly exist under the apprehension of incurring a censure so\nunworthy of his sentiments; and he would a thousand times sooner\nundergo the persecution of his rancorous creditor, than bear the\nthought of being in the smallest consideration lessened in her esteem;\nnay, so far did he carry his pretensions to punctilio, as to protest,\nthat, should she refuse to quiet the scruples of his honour on this\nscore, her unyielding beneficence would serve only to hasten the\nexecution of his determined purpose, to withdraw himself at once from a\nlife of vanity and misfortune."

She advanced all the\narguments her reason, love, and terror could suggest, reminded him of\nher oath, from which he could not suppose she would recede, whatever\nthe consequence might be; and in conclusion vowed to Heaven, with great\nsolemnity and devotion, that she would not survive the news of his\ndeath. Thus the alternative she offered was either to retain the chain\nand be happy in her affection, or forfeit all title to her love, and\ndie in the conviction of having brought his innocent mistress to an\nuntimely grave.His fortitude was not proof against this last consideration. “My savage\nhonour,” said he, “would enable me to endure the pangs of eternal\nseparation in the confidence of being endowed with the power of ending\nthese tortures by the energy of my own hand; but the prospect of\nWilhelmina’s death, and that too occasioned by my inflexibility,\ndisarms my soul of all her resolution, swallows up the dictates of my\njealous pride, and fills my bosom with such a gush of tenderness and\nsorrow, as overwhelms the whole economy of my purpose! Yes, enchanting\ncreature! I sacrifice my glory to that irresistible reflection; and,\nrather than know myself the cruel instrument of robbing the world of\nsuch perfection, consent to retain the fatal testimony of your love.”So saying, he pocketed the chain, with an air of ineffable\nmortification, and was rewarded for his compliance with the most\nendearing caresses of his Dulcinea, who, amidst the tumults of her joy,\nejaculated a thousand acknowledgments to Heaven for having blessed her\nwith the affection of such a man, whose honour was unrivalled by\nanything but his love.CHAPTER SIXTEENHIS SUCCESS BEGETS A BLIND SECURITY, BY WHICH HE IS ONCE AGAIN\nWELL-NIGH ENTRAPPED IN HIS DULCINEA’S APARTMENT.In this manner did the crafty Fathom turn to account those ingratiating\nqualifications he inherited from nature, and maintain, with incredible\nassiduity and circumspection, an amorous correspondence with two\ndomestic rivals, who watched the conduct of each other with the most\nindefatigable virulence of envious suspicion, until an accident\nhappened, which had well-nigh overturned the bark of his policy, and\ninduced him to alter the course, that he might not be shipwrecked on\nthe rocks that began to multiply in the prosecution of his present\nvoyage."

Accordingly, when the time of this festival revolved,\nhe, as usual, ordered Wilhelmina to surrender it for the day. This\ninjunction, the reader will perceive, our young lady was in no\ncondition to obey; she had, however, foreseen the demand, and contrived\na scheme of behaviour for the occasion, which she forthwith put in\nexecution.With an air of uncommon cheerfulness, purposely assumed, she retired to\nher closet, on pretence of complying with his desire, and, having\nemployed a few minutes in rummaging her drawers and disordering her\nmoveables, uttered a loud shriek, that brought her father instantly\ninto the apartment, where he found his daughter tossing about her\nclothes and trinkets with violent demonstrations of disorder and\naffright, and heard her, in a lamentable strain, declare that she was\nrobbed of her chain, and for ever undone. This was so far from being an\nagreeable intimation to the jeweller, that he was struck dumb with\nastonishment and vexation, and it was not till after a long pause that\nhe pronounced the word Sacrament! with an emphasis denoting the most\nmortifying surprise.Soon as that exclamation escaped from his lips, he flew to the\nescritoire as if instinctively, and, joining Wilhelmina in her\noccupation, tumbled its whole contents upon the floor in a trice."

Notwithstanding this apology, and the efforts he made in\nthe sequel to entertain his friends with jollity and good-humour, his\nheart was so linked to the chain, that he could not detach himself from\nthe thoughts of it, which invaded him at short intervals in such qualms\nas effectually spoiled his appetite, and hindered his digestion.He revolved within himself the circumstances of his disaster, and, in\ncanvassing all the probable means by which the chain would be stolen,\nconcluded that the deed must have been done by some person in the\nfamily, who, in consequence of having access to his daughter’s chamber,\nhad either found the drawer left open by her carelessness and neglect,\nor found means to obtain a false key, by some waxen impression; for the\nlocks of the escritoire were safe and uninjured. His suspicion being\nthus confined within his own house, sometimes pitched upon his workmen,\nand sometimes upon his wife, who, he thought, was the more likely to\npractise such finesse, as she considered Wilhelmina in the light of a\ndaughter-in-law, whose interest interfered with her own, and who had\noften harangued to him in private on the folly of leaving this very\nchain in the young lady’s possession."

Aroused by these sentiments, he resolved to retaliate her own\nschemes, by contriving means to visit her cabinet in secret, and, if\npossible, to rob the robber of the spoils she had gathered to his\nprejudice, without coming to any explanation, which might end in\ndomestic turmoils and eternal disquiet.While the husband exercised his reflection in this manner, his innocent\nmate did not allow the powers of her imagination to rest in idleness\nand sloth. Her observations touching the loss of the chain were such as\na suspicious woman, biassed by hatred and envy, would naturally make.\nTo her it seemed highly improbable, that a thing of such value, so\ncarefully deposited, should vanish without the connivance of its\nkeeper, and without much expense of conjecture, divined the true manner\nin which it was conveyed. The sole difficulty that occurred in the\nresearches of her sagacity, was to know the gallant who had been\nfavoured with such a pledge of Wilhelmina’s affection; for, as the\nreader will easily imagine, she never dreamed of viewing Ferdinand in\nthat odious perspective. In order to satisfy her curiosity, discover\nthis happy favourite, and be revenged on her petulant rival, she\nprevailed upon the jeweller to employ a scout, who should watch all\nnight upon the stair, without the knowledge of any other person in the\nfamily, alleging, that in all likelihood, the housemaid gave private\nadmittance to some lover who was the author of all the losses they had\nlately suffered, and that they might possibly detect him in his\nnocturnal adventures; and observing that it would be imprudent to\nintimate their design to Wilhelmina, lest, through the heedlessness and\nindiscretion of youth, she might chance to divulge the secret, so as to\nfrustrate their aim."

  "content": "A Swiss, in whose honesty the German could confide, being hired for\nthis purpose, was posted in a dark corner of the staircase, within a\nfew paces of the door, which he was directed to watch, and actually\nstood sentinel three nights, without perceiving the least object of\nsuspicion; but, on the fourth, the evil stars of our adventurer\nconducted him to the spot, on his voyage to the apartment of his\nDulcinea, with whom he had preconcerted the assignation. Having made\nthe signal, which consisted of two gentle taps on her door, he was\nimmediately admitted; and the Swiss no sooner saw him fairly housed,\nthan he crept softly to the other door, that was left open for the\npurpose, and gave immediate intimation of what he had perceived. This\nintelligence, however, he could not convey so secretly, but the lovers,\nwho were always vigilant upon these occasions, overheard a sort of\ncommotion in the jeweller’s chamber, the cause of which their\napprehension was ingenious enough to comprehend.We have formerly observed that our adventurer could not make his\nretreat by the door, without running a very great risk of being\ndetected, and the expedient of the chimney he had no inclination to\nrepeat; so that he found himself in a very uncomfortable dilemma, and\nwas utterly abandoned by all his invention and address, when his\nmistress, in a whisper, desired him to begin a dialogue, aloud, in an\napology, importing, that he had mistaken the door, and that his\nintention was to visit her father, touching a ring belonging to the\nyoung Count Melvil, which she knew Fathom had put into his hands, in\norder to be altered.Ferdinand, seizing the hint, availed himself of it without delay, and,\nunbolting the door, pronounced in an audible voice, “Upon my honour,\nMademoiselle, you wrong my intention, if you imagine I came hither with\nany disrespectful or dishonourable motive. I have business with your\nfather, which cannot be delayed till to-morrow, without manifest\nprejudice to my friend and myself; therefore I took the liberty of\nvisiting him at these untimely hours, and it has been my misfortune to\nmistake the door in the dark. I beg pardon for my involuntary\nintrusion, and again assure you, that nothing was farther from my\nthoughts than any design to violate that respect which I have always\nentertained for you and your father’s family.”"

As for the interruption I have\nsuffered in my repose, I impute it to my own forgetfulness, in leaving\nmy door unlocked, and blame myself so severely for the omission, that I\nshall, to-morrow, put it out of my own power to be guilty of the like\nfor the future, by ordering the passage to be nailed up; meanwhile, if\nyou would persuade me of your well-meaning, you will instantly\nwithdraw, lest my reputation should suffer by your continuance in my\napartment.”“Madam,” answered our hero, “I will not give you an opportunity to\nrepeat the command, which I shall forthwith obey, after having\nentreated you once more to forgive the disturbance I have given.” So\nsaying, he gently opened the door, and, at sight of the German and his\nwife, who, he well knew, waited for his exit, started back, and gave\ntokens of confusion, which was partly real and partly affected. The\njeweller, fully satisfied with Fathom’s declaration to his daughter,\nreceived him with a complaisant look, and, in order to alleviate his\nconcern, gave him to understand, that he already knew the reason of his\nbeing in that apartment, and desired to be informed of what had\nprocured him the honour to see him at such a juncture."

After begging pardon for having intruded upon your\nfamily at these hours, I must now tell you that my cousin, Count\nMelvil, was some time ago so much misrepresented to his mother by\ncertain malicious informers, who delight in sowing discord in private\nfamilies, that she actually believed her son an extravagant\nspendthrift, who had not only consumed his remittances in the most\nriotous scenes of disorder, but also indulged a pernicious appetite for\ngaming, to such a degree, that he had lost all his clothes and jewels\nat play. In consequence of such false information, she expostulated\nwith him in a severe letter, and desired he would transmit to her that\nring which is in your custody, it being a family stone, for which she\nexpressed an inestimable value. The young gentleman, in his answer to\nher reproof, endeavoured to vindicate himself from the aspersions which\nhad been cast upon his character, and, with regard to the ring, told\nher it was at present in the hands of a jeweller, in order to be new\nset according to her own directions, and that, whenever it should be\naltered, he would send it home to her by some safe conveyance. This\naccount the good lady took for an evasion, and upon that supposition\nhas again written to him, in such a provoking style, that, although the\nletter arrived but half an hour ago, he is determined to despatch a\ncourier before morning with the mischievous ring, for which, in\ncompliance with the impetuosity of his temper, I have taken the freedom\nto disturb you at this unseasonable hour.”The German paid implicit faith to every circumstance of his story,\nwhich indeed could not well be supposed to be invented extempore; the\nring was immediately restored, and our adventurer took his leave,\ncongratulating himself upon his signal deliverance from the snare in\nwhich he had fallen.CHAPTER SEVENTEENTHE STEP-DAME’S SUSPICIONS BEING AWAKENED, SHE LAYS A SNARE FOR OUR\nADVENTURER, FROM WHICH HE IS DELIVERED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF HIS GOOD\nGENIUS.Though the husband swallowed the bait without further inquiry, the\npenetration of the wife was not so easily deceived. That same dialogue\nin Wilhelmina’s apartment, far from allaying, rather inflamed her\nsuspicion; because, in the like emergency, she herself had once\nprofited by the same, or nearly the same contrivance. Without\ncommunicating her doubts to the father, she resolved to double her\nattention to the daughter’s future conduct, and keep such a strict eye\nover the behaviour of our gallant, that he should find it very\ndifficult, if not impossible, to elude her observation. For this\npurpose she took into her pay an old maiden, of the right sour\ndisposition, who lived in a house opposite to her own, and directed her\nto follow the young lady in all her outgoings, whenever she should\nreceive from the window a certain signal, which the mother-in-law\nagreed to make for the occasion. It was not long before this scheme\nsucceeded to her wish. The door of communication betwixt Wilhelmina’s\napartment and the staircase being nailed up by the jeweller’s express\norder, our adventurer was altogether deprived of those opportunities he\nhad hitherto enjoyed, and was not at all mortified to find himself so\nrestricted in a correspondence which began to be tiresome and\ndisagreeable. But the case was far otherwise with his Dulcinea, whose\npassion, the more it was thwarted, raged with greater violence, like a\nfire, that, from the attempts that are made to extinguish it, gathers\ngreater force, and flames with double fury."

This intimation she proposed to convey privately\ninto the hand of her lover, during his next visit to the family; but\nboth were so narrowly eyed by the mother, that she found the execution\nof her design impracticable; and next forenoon, on pretence of going to\nchurch, repaired to the house of a companion, who, being also her\nconfidant, undertook to deliver the billet with her own hand.The she-dragon employed by her mother, in obedience to the sign which\nwas displayed from the window immediately put on her veil, and followed\nWilhelmina at a distance, until she saw her fairly housed. She would\nnot even then return from her excursion, but hovered about in sight of\nthe door, with a view of making further observations. In less than five\nminutes after the young lady disappeared, the scout perceived her\ncoming out, accompanied by her comrade, from whom she instantly parted,\nand bent her way towards the church in good earnest, while the other\nsteered her course in another direction. The duenna, after a moment’s\nsuspense and consideration, divined the true cause of this short visit,\nand resolved to watch the motions of the confidant, whom she traced to\nthe academy in which our hero lodged, and from which she saw her\nreturn, after the supposed message was delivered."

Her employer was equally astonished and incensed at this\ninformation. She was seized with all that frenzy which takes possession\nof a slighted woman, when she finds herself supplanted by a detested\nrival; and, in the first transports of her indignation, devoted them as\nsacrifices to her vengeance. Nor was her surprise so much the effect of\nhis dissimulation, as of his want of taste and discernment. She\ninveighed against him, not as the most treacherous lover, but as the\nmost abject wretch, in courting the smiles of such an awkward dowdy,\nwhile he enjoyed the favours of a woman who had numbered princes in the\ntrain of her admirers. For the brilliancy of her attractions, such as\nthey at present shone, she appealed to the decision of her minister,\nwho consulted her own satisfaction and interest, by flattering the\nother’s vanity and resentment; and so unaccountable did the depravity\nof our hero’s judgment appear to this conceited dame, that she began to\nbelieve there was some mistake in the person, and to hope that\nWilhelmina’s gallant was not in reality her professed admirer, Mr.\nFathom, but rather one of his fellow-lodgers, whose passion he favoured\nwith his mediation and assistance.On this notion, which nothing but mere vanity could have inspired, in\nopposition to so many more weighty presumptions, she took the\nresolution of bringing the affair to a fuller explanation, before she\nwould concert any measures to the prejudice of our adventurer, and\nforthwith despatched her spy back to his lodgings, to solicit, on the\npart of Wilhelmina, an immediate answer to the letter he had received.\nThis was an expedition with which the old maiden would have willingly\ndispensed, because it was founded upon an uncertainty, which might be\nattended with troublesome consequences; but, rather than be the means\nof retarding a negotiation so productive of that sort of mischief which\nis particularly agreeable to all of her tribe, she undertook to manage\nand effect the discovery, in full confidence of her own talents and\nexperience."

The artful agent having\nasked, with the mysterious air of an expert go-between, if he had not\nlately received a message from a certain young lady, and, being\nanswered in the affirmative, gave him to understand, that she herself\nwas a person favoured with the friendship and confidence of Wilhelmina,\nwhom she had known from her cradle, and often dandled on her knee;\nthen, in the genuine style of a prattling dry nurse, she launched out\nin encomiums on his Dulcinea’s beauty and sweetness of temper,\nrecounting many simple occurrences of her infancy and childhood; and,\nfinally, desiring a more circumstantial answer to that which she had\nsent to him by her friend Catherina. In the course of her loquacity she\nhad also, according to her instructions, hinted at the misfortune of\nthe door; and, on the whole, performed her cue with such dexterity and\ndiscretion that our politician was actually overreached, and, having\nfinished his epistle, committed it to her care, with many verbal\nexpressions of eternal love and fidelity to his charming Wilhelmina.The messenger, doubly rejoiced at her achievement, which not only\nrecommended her ministry, but also gratified her malice, returned to\nher principal with great exultation, and, delivering the letter, the\nreader will easily conceive the transports of that lady when she read\nthe contents of it in these words:—“ANGELIC WILHELMINA!—To forget those ecstatic scenes we have enjoyed\ntogether, or even live without the continuation of that mutual bliss,\nwere to quit all title to perception, and resign every hope of future\nhappiness. No! my charmer, while my head retains the least spark of\ninvention, and my heart glows with the resolution of a man, our\ncorrespondence shall not be cut off by the machinations of an envious\nstepmother, who never had attractions to inspire a generous passion;\nand, now that age and wrinkles have destroyed what little share of\nbeauty she once possessed, endeavours, like the fiend in paradise, to\nblast those joys in others, from which she is herself eternally\nexcluded. Doubt not, dear sovereign of my soul! that I will study, with\nall the eagerness of desiring love, how to frustrate her malicious\nintention, and renew those transporting moments, the remembrance of\nwhich now warms the breast of your ever constant FATHOM.”Had our hero murdered her father, or left her a disconsolate widow, by\neffecting the death of her dear husband, there might have been a\npossibility of her exerting the Christian virtues of resignation and\nforgiveness; but such a personal outrage as that contained in this\nepistle precluded all hope of pardon, and rendered penitence of no\nsignification. His atrocious crime being now fully ascertained, this\nvirago gave a loose to her resentment, which became so loud and\ntempestuous, that her informer shuddered at the storm she had raised,\nand began to repent of having communicated the intelligence which\nseemed to have such a violent effect upon hex brain."
