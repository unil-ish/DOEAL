  "content": "“Suppose,” said he to himself, “this brutal German, instead of being\nstupefied with wine, should come home inflamed with brandy, to the use\nof which he is sometimes addicted, far from feeling any inclination to\nsleep, he will labour under the most fretful anxiety of watching; every\nirascible particle in his disposition will be exasperated; he will be\noffended with every object that may present itself to his view; and, if\nthere is the least ingredient of jealousy in his temper, it will\nmanifest itself in riot and rage. What if his frenzy should prompt him\nto search his wife’s chamber for gallants? this would certainly be the\nfirst place to which he would direct his inquiry; or, granting this\nsupposition chimerical, I may be seized with an irresistible\ninclination to cough, before he is oppressed with sleep; he may be\nwaked by the noise I shall make in disengaging myself from this\nembarrassed situation; and, finally, I may find it impracticable to\nretire unseen or unheard, after everything else shall have succeeded to\nmy wish.”These suggestions did not at all contribute to the quiet of our\nadventurer, who, having waited three whole hours in the most\nuncomfortable suspense, heard the jeweller brought into the room in\nthat very condition which his fears had prognosticated. He had, it\nseems, quarrelled over his cups with another tradesman, and received a\nsalutation on the forehead with a candlestick, which not only left an\nignominious and painful mark upon his countenance, but even disordered\nhis brain to a very dangerous degree of delirium; so that, instead of\nallowing himself quietly to be undressed and put to bed by his wife, he\nanswered all her gentle admonitions and caresses with the most\nopprobrious invectives and obstreperous behaviour; and, though he did\nnot tax her with infidelity to his bed, he virulently accused her of\nextravagance and want of economy; observed, her expensive way of living\nwould bring him to a morsel of bread; and unfortunately recollecting\nthe attempt of the supposed thief, started up from his chair, swearing\nby G—’s mother that he would forthwith arm himself with a brace of\npistols, and search every apartment in the house. “That press,” said\nhe, with great vociferation, “may, for aught I know, be the receptacle\nof some ruffian.”"

This address made such an impression upon\nour adventurer, that he had well-nigh obeyed the summons, and burst\nfrom his concealment, in a desperate effort to escape, without being\nrecognised by the intoxicated German; and indeed, had the application\nbeen repeated, he in all likelihood would have tried the experiment,\nfor by this time his terrors had waxed too strong to be much longer\nsuppressed. From this hazardous enterprise he was, however, exempted by\na lucky accident that happened to his disturber, whose head chancing to\npitch upon the corner of a chair in his fall, he was immediately lulled\ninto a trance, during which the considerate lady, guessing the disorder\nof her gallant, and dreading further interruption, very prudently\nreleased him from his confinement, after she had put out the light, and\nin the dark conveyed him to the door, where he was comforted with the\npromise that she would punctually remember the rendezvous of next day.She then invoked the assistance of the servants, who, being waked for\nthe purpose, lifted up their master, and tumbled him into bed, while\nFerdinand hied him home in an universal sweat, blessing himself from\nany future achievement of that sort in a house where he had been twice\nin such imminent danger of life and reputation. Nevertheless, he did\nnot fail to honour the assignation, and avail himself of the\ndisposition his mistress manifested to make him all the recompense in\nher power for the disappointment and chagrin which he had undergone.CHAPTER FIFTEENBUT AT LENGTH SUCCEEDS IN HIS ATTEMPT UPON BOTH.Having thus gained a complete victory over the affections of these two\nladies, he began to convert his good fortune to the purposes of that\nprinciple, from which his view was never, no, not for a moment,\ndetached. In other words, he used them as ministers and purveyors to\nhis avarice and fraud. As for the mother-in-law, she was of herself so\nliberal as to anticipate the wishes of any moderate adventurer, and\npresented him with sundry valuable jewels, as memorials of her esteem;\nnor was the daughter backward in such expressions of regard; she\nalready considered his interest as her own, and took frequent\nopportunities of secreting for his benefit certain stray trinkets that\nshe happened to pick up in her excursions within doors."

Yet, not contented with what he\nthus could earn, and despairing of being able to steer the bark of his\nfortune for any length of time between two such dangerous quicksands,\nhe resolved to profit by the occasion while it lasted, and strike some\nconsiderable stroke at once. A plan was formed in consequence of this\ndetermination, and, at an appointment with the mother in the house of\ntheir female friend, our adventurer appeared with an air of dejection,\nwhich he veiled with a thin cover of forced pleasantry, that his\nmistress might suppose he endeavoured to conceal some mortal chagrin\nthat preyed upon his heart.The stratagem succeeded to his wish. She observed his countenance\nbetween whiles overcast, took notice of the involuntary sighs he\nheaved; and, with the most tender expressions of sympathy, conjured him\nto make her acquainted with the cause of his affliction. Instead of\ngratifying her request immediately, he evaded her questions with a\nrespectful reserve, implying, that his love would not suffer him to\nmake her a partner in his sorrow; and this delicacy on his part whetted\nher impatience and concern to such a degree, that, rather than keep her\nin such an agony of doubt and apprehension, he was prevailed upon to\ntell her, that he had been, the preceding night, engaged with a company\nof his fellow-students, where he had made too free with the champagne,\nso that his caution forsook him, and he had been decoyed into play by a\nTyrolese gamester, who stripped him of all his ready money, and\nobtained from him an obligation for two hundred florins, which he could\nnot possibly pay without having recourse to his relation the Count de\nMelvil, who would have just cause to be incensed at his extravagance.This information he concluded, by declaring that, cost what it would,\nhe was resolved to make a candid confession of the truth, and throw\nhimself entirely upon the generosity of his patron, who could inflict\nno other punishment than that of discarding him from his favour and\nprotection,—a misfortune which, how grievous soever it might be, he\nshould be able to sustain with fortitude, could he fall upon some\nmethod of satisfying the Tyrolese, who was very importunate and savage\nin his demand. His kind mistress no sooner found out the source of his\ninquietude, than she promised to dry it up, assuring him that next day,\nat the same hour, she would enable him to discharge the debt; so that\nhe might set his heart at ease, and recollect that gaiety which was the\nsoul of her enjoyment."

The attachment I have the honour\nto profess for your amiable person, is not founded on such inglorious\nmotives, but is the genuine result of that generous passion which none\nbut the noble-minded feel, and the only circumstance of this misfortune\nthat I dread to encounter, is the necessity of withdrawing myself for\never from the presence of her whose genial smiles could animate my soul\nagainst all the persecution of adverse fortune.”This declamation, accompanied with a profound sigh, served only to\ninflame her desire of extricating him from the difficulty in which he\nwas involved. She exhausted all her eloquence in attempting to persuade\nhim that his refusal was an outrage against her affection. He pretended\nto refute her arguments, and remained unshaken by all the power of her\nsolicitations, until she had recourse to the most passionate\nremonstrances of love, and fell at his feet in the posture of a forlorn\nshepherdess. What he refused to her reason, he granted to her tears,\nbecause his heart was melted by her affliction, and next day\ncondescended to accept of her money, out of pure regard to her\nhappiness and peace.Encouraged by the success of this achievement, he resolved to practise\nthe same experiment upon Wilhelmina, in hope of extracting an equal\nshare of profit from her simplicity and attachment, and, at their very\nnext nocturnal rendezvous in her chamber, reacted the farce already\nrehearsed, with a small variation, which he thought necessary to\nstimulate the young lady in his behalf. He rightly concluded, that she\nwas by no means mistress of such a considerable sum as he had already\nextorted from her mother, and therefore thought proper to represent\nhimself in the most urgent predicament, that her apprehension, on his\naccount, might be so alarmed as to engage her in some enterprise for\nhis advantage, which otherwise she would never have dreamed of\nundertaking. With this view, after having described his own calamitous\nsituation, in consequence of her pressing entreaties, which he affected\nto evade, he gave her to understand, that there was no person upon\nearth to whom he would have recourse in this emergency; for which\nreason he was determined to rid himself of all his cares at once, upon\nthe friendly point of his own faithful sword."

Her grief manifested itself in a flood of tears,\nwhile she hung round his neck, conjuring him in the most melting terms,\nby their mutual love, in which they had been so happy, to lay aside\nthat fatal determination, which would infallibly involve her in the\nsame fate; for, she took Heaven to witness, that she would not one\nmoment survive the knowledge of his death.He was not deficient in expressions of reciprocal regard. He extolled\nher love and tenderness with a most extravagant eulogium, and seemed\nwrung with mortal anguish at the prospect of parting for ever from his\nlovely Wilhelmina; but his honour was a stern and rigid creditor, that\ncould not be appeased, except with his blood; and all the boon she\ncould obtain, by dint of the most woful supplication, was a promise to\ndefer the execution of his baleful purpose for the space of\nfour-and-twenty hours, during which she hoped Heaven would\ncompassionate her sufferings, and inspire her with some contrivance for\ntheir mutual relief. Thus he yielded to her fervent request, rather\nwith a view to calm the present transports of her sorrow, than with any\nexpectation of seeing himself redeemed from his fate by her\ninterposition; such at least were his professions when he took his\nleave, assuring her, that he would not quit his being before he should\nhave devoted a few hours to another interview with the dear object of\nhis love.Having thus kindled the train, he did not doubt that the mine of his\ncraft would take effect, and repaired to his own lodging, in full\npersuasion of seeing his aim accomplished, before the time fixed for\ntheir last assignation. His prognostic was next morning verified by the\narrival of a messenger, who brought to him a small parcel, to which was\ncemented, with sealing wax, the following epistle:—"

  "content": "“JEWEL OF MY SOUL!—Scarce had you, last night, quitted my disconsolate\narms, when I happily recollected that there was in my possession a gold\nchain, of value more than sufficient to answer the exigence of your\npresent occasions. It was pledged to my grandfather for two hundred\ncrowns by a knight of Malta, who soon after perished in a sea\nengagement with the enemies of our faith, so that it became the\nproperty of our house, and was bequeathed to me by the old gentleman,\nas a memorial of his particular affection. Upon whom can I more\nproperly bestow it, than him who is already master of my heart! Receive\nit, therefore, from the bearer of this billet, and convert it, without\nscruple, to that use which shall be most conducive to your ease and\nsatisfaction; nor seek, from a true romantic notion of honour, which I\nknow you entertain, to excuse yourself from accepting this testimony of\nmy affection. For I have already sworn before an image of our blessed\nLady, that I will no longer own you as the sovereign of my heart, nor\neven indulge you with another interview, if you reject this mark of\ntenderness and concern from your ever faithful WILHELMINA.”The heart of our adventurer began to bound with joy when he surveyed\nthe contents of this letter; and his eyes sparkled with transport at\nsight of the chain, which he immediately perceived to be worth twice\nthe sum she had mentioned. Nevertheless, he would not avail himself,\nwithout further question, of her generosity; but, that same night,\nrepairing to her apartment at the usual hour of meeting, he prostrated\nhimself before her, and counterfeiting extreme agitation of spirit,\nbegged, in the most urgent terms, not even unaccompanied with tears,\nthat she would take back the present, which he tendered for her\nacceptance, and spare him the most insufferable mortification of\nthinking himself exposed to the imputation of being mercenary in his\nlove. Such, he said, was the delicacy of his passion, that he could not\npossibly exist under the apprehension of incurring a censure so\nunworthy of his sentiments; and he would a thousand times sooner\nundergo the persecution of his rancorous creditor, than bear the\nthought of being in the smallest consideration lessened in her esteem;\nnay, so far did he carry his pretensions to punctilio, as to protest,\nthat, should she refuse to quiet the scruples of his honour on this\nscore, her unyielding beneficence would serve only to hasten the\nexecution of his determined purpose, to withdraw himself at once from a\nlife of vanity and misfortune."

She advanced all the\narguments her reason, love, and terror could suggest, reminded him of\nher oath, from which he could not suppose she would recede, whatever\nthe consequence might be; and in conclusion vowed to Heaven, with great\nsolemnity and devotion, that she would not survive the news of his\ndeath. Thus the alternative she offered was either to retain the chain\nand be happy in her affection, or forfeit all title to her love, and\ndie in the conviction of having brought his innocent mistress to an\nuntimely grave.His fortitude was not proof against this last consideration. “My savage\nhonour,” said he, “would enable me to endure the pangs of eternal\nseparation in the confidence of being endowed with the power of ending\nthese tortures by the energy of my own hand; but the prospect of\nWilhelmina’s death, and that too occasioned by my inflexibility,\ndisarms my soul of all her resolution, swallows up the dictates of my\njealous pride, and fills my bosom with such a gush of tenderness and\nsorrow, as overwhelms the whole economy of my purpose! Yes, enchanting\ncreature! I sacrifice my glory to that irresistible reflection; and,\nrather than know myself the cruel instrument of robbing the world of\nsuch perfection, consent to retain the fatal testimony of your love.”So saying, he pocketed the chain, with an air of ineffable\nmortification, and was rewarded for his compliance with the most\nendearing caresses of his Dulcinea, who, amidst the tumults of her joy,\nejaculated a thousand acknowledgments to Heaven for having blessed her\nwith the affection of such a man, whose honour was unrivalled by\nanything but his love.CHAPTER SIXTEENHIS SUCCESS BEGETS A BLIND SECURITY, BY WHICH HE IS ONCE AGAIN\nWELL-NIGH ENTRAPPED IN HIS DULCINEA’S APARTMENT.In this manner did the crafty Fathom turn to account those ingratiating\nqualifications he inherited from nature, and maintain, with incredible\nassiduity and circumspection, an amorous correspondence with two\ndomestic rivals, who watched the conduct of each other with the most\nindefatigable virulence of envious suspicion, until an accident\nhappened, which had well-nigh overturned the bark of his policy, and\ninduced him to alter the course, that he might not be shipwrecked on\nthe rocks that began to multiply in the prosecution of his present\nvoyage."

Accordingly, when the time of this festival revolved,\nhe, as usual, ordered Wilhelmina to surrender it for the day. This\ninjunction, the reader will perceive, our young lady was in no\ncondition to obey; she had, however, foreseen the demand, and contrived\na scheme of behaviour for the occasion, which she forthwith put in\nexecution.With an air of uncommon cheerfulness, purposely assumed, she retired to\nher closet, on pretence of complying with his desire, and, having\nemployed a few minutes in rummaging her drawers and disordering her\nmoveables, uttered a loud shriek, that brought her father instantly\ninto the apartment, where he found his daughter tossing about her\nclothes and trinkets with violent demonstrations of disorder and\naffright, and heard her, in a lamentable strain, declare that she was\nrobbed of her chain, and for ever undone. This was so far from being an\nagreeable intimation to the jeweller, that he was struck dumb with\nastonishment and vexation, and it was not till after a long pause that\nhe pronounced the word Sacrament! with an emphasis denoting the most\nmortifying surprise.Soon as that exclamation escaped from his lips, he flew to the\nescritoire as if instinctively, and, joining Wilhelmina in her\noccupation, tumbled its whole contents upon the floor in a trice."

Notwithstanding this apology, and the efforts he made in\nthe sequel to entertain his friends with jollity and good-humour, his\nheart was so linked to the chain, that he could not detach himself from\nthe thoughts of it, which invaded him at short intervals in such qualms\nas effectually spoiled his appetite, and hindered his digestion.He revolved within himself the circumstances of his disaster, and, in\ncanvassing all the probable means by which the chain would be stolen,\nconcluded that the deed must have been done by some person in the\nfamily, who, in consequence of having access to his daughter’s chamber,\nhad either found the drawer left open by her carelessness and neglect,\nor found means to obtain a false key, by some waxen impression; for the\nlocks of the escritoire were safe and uninjured. His suspicion being\nthus confined within his own house, sometimes pitched upon his workmen,\nand sometimes upon his wife, who, he thought, was the more likely to\npractise such finesse, as she considered Wilhelmina in the light of a\ndaughter-in-law, whose interest interfered with her own, and who had\noften harangued to him in private on the folly of leaving this very\nchain in the young lady’s possession."

Aroused by these sentiments, he resolved to retaliate her own\nschemes, by contriving means to visit her cabinet in secret, and, if\npossible, to rob the robber of the spoils she had gathered to his\nprejudice, without coming to any explanation, which might end in\ndomestic turmoils and eternal disquiet.While the husband exercised his reflection in this manner, his innocent\nmate did not allow the powers of her imagination to rest in idleness\nand sloth. Her observations touching the loss of the chain were such as\na suspicious woman, biassed by hatred and envy, would naturally make.\nTo her it seemed highly improbable, that a thing of such value, so\ncarefully deposited, should vanish without the connivance of its\nkeeper, and without much expense of conjecture, divined the true manner\nin which it was conveyed. The sole difficulty that occurred in the\nresearches of her sagacity, was to know the gallant who had been\nfavoured with such a pledge of Wilhelmina’s affection; for, as the\nreader will easily imagine, she never dreamed of viewing Ferdinand in\nthat odious perspective. In order to satisfy her curiosity, discover\nthis happy favourite, and be revenged on her petulant rival, she\nprevailed upon the jeweller to employ a scout, who should watch all\nnight upon the stair, without the knowledge of any other person in the\nfamily, alleging, that in all likelihood, the housemaid gave private\nadmittance to some lover who was the author of all the losses they had\nlately suffered, and that they might possibly detect him in his\nnocturnal adventures; and observing that it would be imprudent to\nintimate their design to Wilhelmina, lest, through the heedlessness and\nindiscretion of youth, she might chance to divulge the secret, so as to\nfrustrate their aim."

Having made\nthe signal, which consisted of two gentle taps on her door, he was\nimmediately admitted; and the Swiss no sooner saw him fairly housed,\nthan he crept softly to the other door, that was left open for the\npurpose, and gave immediate intimation of what he had perceived. This\nintelligence, however, he could not convey so secretly, but the lovers,\nwho were always vigilant upon these occasions, overheard a sort of\ncommotion in the jeweller’s chamber, the cause of which their\napprehension was ingenious enough to comprehend.We have formerly observed that our adventurer could not make his\nretreat by the door, without running a very great risk of being\ndetected, and the expedient of the chimney he had no inclination to\nrepeat; so that he found himself in a very uncomfortable dilemma, and\nwas utterly abandoned by all his invention and address, when his\nmistress, in a whisper, desired him to begin a dialogue, aloud, in an\napology, importing, that he had mistaken the door, and that his\nintention was to visit her father, touching a ring belonging to the\nyoung Count Melvil, which she knew Fathom had put into his hands, in\norder to be altered.Ferdinand, seizing the hint, availed himself of it without delay, and,\nunbolting the door, pronounced in an audible voice, “Upon my honour,\nMademoiselle, you wrong my intention, if you imagine I came hither with\nany disrespectful or dishonourable motive. I have business with your\nfather, which cannot be delayed till to-morrow, without manifest\nprejudice to my friend and myself; therefore I took the liberty of\nvisiting him at these untimely hours, and it has been my misfortune to\nmistake the door in the dark.

As for the interruption I have\nsuffered in my repose, I impute it to my own forgetfulness, in leaving\nmy door unlocked, and blame myself so severely for the omission, that I\nshall, to-morrow, put it out of my own power to be guilty of the like\nfor the future, by ordering the passage to be nailed up; meanwhile, if\nyou would persuade me of your well-meaning, you will instantly\nwithdraw, lest my reputation should suffer by your continuance in my\napartment.”“Madam,” answered our hero, “I will not give you an opportunity to\nrepeat the command, which I shall forthwith obey, after having\nentreated you once more to forgive the disturbance I have given.” So\nsaying, he gently opened the door, and, at sight of the German and his\nwife, who, he well knew, waited for his exit, started back, and gave\ntokens of confusion, which was partly real and partly affected.

After begging pardon for having intruded upon your\nfamily at these hours, I must now tell you that my cousin, Count\nMelvil, was some time ago so much misrepresented to his mother by\ncertain malicious informers, who delight in sowing discord in private\nfamilies, that she actually believed her son an extravagant\nspendthrift, who had not only consumed his remittances in the most\nriotous scenes of disorder, but also indulged a pernicious appetite for\ngaming, to such a degree, that he had lost all his clothes and jewels\nat play. In consequence of such false information, she expostulated\nwith him in a severe letter, and desired he would transmit to her that\nring which is in your custody, it being a family stone, for which she\nexpressed an inestimable value. The young gentleman, in his answer to\nher reproof, endeavoured to vindicate himself from the aspersions which\nhad been cast upon his character, and, with regard to the ring, told\nher it was at present in the hands of a jeweller, in order to be new\nset according to her own directions, and that, whenever it should be\naltered, he would send it home to her by some safe conveyance. This\naccount the good lady took for an evasion, and upon that supposition\nhas again written to him, in such a provoking style, that, although the\nletter arrived but half an hour ago, he is determined to despatch a\ncourier before morning with the mischievous ring, for which, in\ncompliance with the impetuosity of his temper, I have taken the freedom\nto disturb you at this unseasonable hour.”The German paid implicit faith to every circumstance of his story,\nwhich indeed could not well be supposed to be invented extempore; the\nring was immediately restored, and our adventurer took his leave,\ncongratulating himself upon his signal deliverance from the snare in\nwhich he had fallen.CHAPTER SEVENTEENTHE STEP-DAME’S SUSPICIONS BEING AWAKENED, SHE LAYS A SNARE FOR OUR\nADVENTURER, FROM WHICH HE IS DELIVERED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF HIS GOOD\nGENIUS.Though the husband swallowed the bait without further inquiry, the\npenetration of the wife was not so easily deceived. That same dialogue\nin Wilhelmina’s apartment, far from allaying, rather inflamed her\nsuspicion; because, in the like emergency, she herself had once\nprofited by the same, or nearly the same contrivance. Without\ncommunicating her doubts to the father, she resolved to double her\nattention to the daughter’s future conduct, and keep such a strict eye\nover the behaviour of our gallant, that he should find it very\ndifficult, if not impossible, to elude her observation. For this\npurpose she took into her pay an old maiden, of the right sour\ndisposition, who lived in a house opposite to her own, and directed her\nto follow the young lady in all her outgoings, whenever she should\nreceive from the window a certain signal, which the mother-in-law\nagreed to make for the occasion. It was not long before this scheme\nsucceeded to her wish. The door of communication betwixt Wilhelmina’s\napartment and the staircase being nailed up by the jeweller’s express\norder, our adventurer was altogether deprived of those opportunities he\nhad hitherto enjoyed, and was not at all mortified to find himself so\nrestricted in a correspondence which began to be tiresome and\ndisagreeable. But the case was far otherwise with his Dulcinea, whose\npassion, the more it was thwarted, raged with greater violence, like a\nfire, that, from the attempts that are made to extinguish it, gathers\ngreater force, and flames with double fury."

This intimation she proposed to convey privately\ninto the hand of her lover, during his next visit to the family; but\nboth were so narrowly eyed by the mother, that she found the execution\nof her design impracticable; and next forenoon, on pretence of going to\nchurch, repaired to the house of a companion, who, being also her\nconfidant, undertook to deliver the billet with her own hand.The she-dragon employed by her mother, in obedience to the sign which\nwas displayed from the window immediately put on her veil, and followed\nWilhelmina at a distance, until she saw her fairly housed. She would\nnot even then return from her excursion, but hovered about in sight of\nthe door, with a view of making further observations.

The duenna, after a moment’s\nsuspense and consideration, divined the true cause of this short visit,\nand resolved to watch the motions of the confidant, whom she traced to\nthe academy in which our hero lodged, and from which she saw her\nreturn, after the supposed message was delivered."

Her employer was equally astonished and incensed at this\ninformation. She was seized with all that frenzy which takes possession\nof a slighted woman, when she finds herself supplanted by a detested\nrival; and, in the first transports of her indignation, devoted them as\nsacrifices to her vengeance. Nor was her surprise so much the effect of\nhis dissimulation, as of his want of taste and discernment. She\ninveighed against him, not as the most treacherous lover, but as the\nmost abject wretch, in courting the smiles of such an awkward dowdy,\nwhile he enjoyed the favours of a woman who had numbered princes in the\ntrain of her admirers. For the brilliancy of her attractions, such as\nthey at present shone, she appealed to the decision of her minister,\nwho consulted her own satisfaction and interest, by flattering the\nother’s vanity and resentment; and so unaccountable did the depravity\nof our hero’s judgment appear to this conceited dame, that she began to\nbelieve there was some mistake in the person, and to hope that\nWilhelmina’s gallant was not in reality her professed admirer, Mr.\nFathom, but rather one of his fellow-lodgers, whose passion he favoured\nwith his mediation and assistance.On this notion, which nothing but mere vanity could have inspired, in\nopposition to so many more weighty presumptions, she took the\nresolution of bringing the affair to a fuller explanation, before she\nwould concert any measures to the prejudice of our adventurer, and\nforthwith despatched her spy back to his lodgings, to solicit, on the\npart of Wilhelmina, an immediate answer to the letter he had received.\nThis was an expedition with which the old maiden would have willingly\ndispensed, because it was founded upon an uncertainty, which might be\nattended with troublesome consequences; but, rather than be the means\nof retarding a negotiation so productive of that sort of mischief which\nis particularly agreeable to all of her tribe, she undertook to manage\nand effect the discovery, in full confidence of her own talents and\nexperience."

The artful agent having\nasked, with the mysterious air of an expert go-between, if he had not\nlately received a message from a certain young lady, and, being\nanswered in the affirmative, gave him to understand, that she herself\nwas a person favoured with the friendship and confidence of Wilhelmina,\nwhom she had known from her cradle, and often dandled on her knee;\nthen, in the genuine style of a prattling dry nurse, she launched out\nin encomiums on his Dulcinea’s beauty and sweetness of temper,\nrecounting many simple occurrences of her infancy and childhood; and,\nfinally, desiring a more circumstantial answer to that which she had\nsent to him by her friend Catherina. In the course of her loquacity she\nhad also, according to her instructions, hinted at the misfortune of\nthe door; and, on the whole, performed her cue with such dexterity and\ndiscretion that our politician was actually overreached, and, having\nfinished his epistle, committed it to her care, with many verbal\nexpressions of eternal love and fidelity to his charming Wilhelmina.The messenger, doubly rejoiced at her achievement, which not only\nrecommended her ministry, but also gratified her malice, returned to\nher principal with great exultation, and, delivering the letter, the\nreader will easily conceive the transports of that lady when she read\nthe contents of it in these words:—“ANGELIC WILHELMINA!—To forget those ecstatic scenes we have enjoyed\ntogether, or even live without the continuation of that mutual bliss,\nwere to quit all title to perception, and resign every hope of future\nhappiness. No! my charmer, while my head retains the least spark of\ninvention, and my heart glows with the resolution of a man, our\ncorrespondence shall not be cut off by the machinations of an envious\nstepmother, who never had attractions to inspire a generous passion;\nand, now that age and wrinkles have destroyed what little share of\nbeauty she once possessed, endeavours, like the fiend in paradise, to\nblast those joys in others, from which she is herself eternally\nexcluded. Doubt not, dear sovereign of my soul! that I will study, with\nall the eagerness of desiring love, how to frustrate her malicious\nintention, and renew those transporting moments, the remembrance of\nwhich now warms the breast of your ever constant FATHOM.”Had our hero murdered her father, or left her a disconsolate widow, by\neffecting the death of her dear husband, there might have been a\npossibility of her exerting the Christian virtues of resignation and\nforgiveness; but such a personal outrage as that contained in this\nepistle precluded all hope of pardon, and rendered penitence of no\nsignification. His atrocious crime being now fully ascertained, this\nvirago gave a loose to her resentment, which became so loud and\ntempestuous, that her informer shuddered at the storm she had raised,\nand began to repent of having communicated the intelligence which\nseemed to have such a violent effect upon hex brain."

In the zenith of her rage, she would have\nhad immediate recourse to poison or steel, had she not been diverted\nfrom her mortal purpose by her counsellor, who represented the danger\nof engaging in such violent measures, and proposed a more secure\nscheme, in the execution of which she would see the perfidious wretch\nsufficiently punished, without any hazard to her own person or\nreputation. She advised her to inform the jeweller of Fathom’s efforts\nto seduce her conjugal fidelity, and impart to him a plan, by which he\nwould have it in his power to detect our adventurer in the very act of\npractising upon her virtue.The lady relished her proposal, and actually resolved to make an\nassignation with Ferdinand, as usual, and give notice of the\nappointment to her husband, that he might personally discover the\ntreachery of his pretended friend, and inflict upon him such\nchastisement as the German’s brutal disposition should suggest, when\ninflamed by that species of provocation. Had this project been brought\nto bear, Ferdinand, in all likelihood, would have been disqualified\nfrom engaging in any future intrigue; but fate ordained that the design\nshould be defeated, in order to reserve him for more important\noccasions.Before the circumstances of the plan could be adjusted, it was his good\nfortune to meet his Dulcinea in the street, and, in the midst of their\nmutual condolence on the interruption they had suffered in their\ncorrespondence, he assured her, that he would never give his invention\nrespite, until he should have verified the protestations contained in\nthe letter he had delivered to her discreet agent. This allusion to a\nbillet she had never received, did not fail to alarm her fears, and\nintroduce a very mortifying explanation, in which he so accurately\ndescribed the person of the messenger, that she forthwith comprehended\nthe plot, and communicated to our hero her sentiments on that subject.Though he expressed infinite anxiety and chagrin at this misfortune,\nwhich could not fail to raise new obstacles to their love, his heart\nwas a stranger to the uneasiness he affected; and rather pleased with\nthe occasion, which would furnish him with pretences to withdraw\nhimself gradually from an intercourse by this time become equally\ncloying and unprofitable. Being well acquainted with the mother’s\ntemperament, he guessed the present situation of her thoughts, and\nconcluding she would make the jeweller a party in her revenge, he\nresolved from that moment to discontinue his visits, and cautiously\nguard against any future interview with the lady whom he had rendered\nso implacable."

Although his penetration was sufficient\nto perceive the drift of this message, or at least to discern the risk\nhe should run in complying with her request, yet he was willing to be\nmore fully certified of the truth of his suspicion, and wrote an answer\nto the billet, in which he assured her, that he would repair to the\nplace of appointment with all the punctuality of an impatient lover.\nNevertheless, instead of performing this promise, he, in the morning,\ntook post in a public-house opposite to the place of assignation, in\norder to reconnoitre the ground, and about noon had the pleasure of\nseeing the German, wrapped in a cloak, enter the door of his wife’s\nshe-friend, though the appointment was fixed at five in the evening.\nFathom blessed his good angel for having conducted him clear of this\nconspiracy, and kept his station with great tranquillity till the hour\nof meeting, when he beheld his enraged Thalestris take the same route,\nand enjoyed her disappointment with ineffable satisfaction.Thus favoured with a pretext, he took his leave of her, in a letter,\ngiving her to understand, that he was no stranger to the barbarous\nsnare she had laid for him; and upbraiding her with having made such an\nungrateful return for all his tenderness and attachment. She was not\nbackward in conveying a reply to this expostulation, which seemed to\nhave been dictated in all the distraction of a proud woman who sees her\nvengeance baffled, as well as her love disdained. Her letter was\nnothing but a succession of reproaches, menaces, and incoherent\nexecrations. She taxed him with knavery, insensibility, and\ndissimulation; imprecated a thousand curses upon his head, and\nthreatened not only to persecute his life with all the arts that hell\nand malice could inspire, but also to wound him in the person of her\ndaughter-in-law, who should be enclosed for life in a convent, where\nshe should have leisure to repent of those loose and disorderly\npractices which he had taught her to commit, and of which she could not\npretend innocence, as they had it in their power to confront her with\nthe evidence of her lover’s own confession. Yet all this denunciation\nwas qualified with an alternative, by which he was given to understand,\nthat the gates of mercy were still open, and that penitence was capable\nof washing out the deepest stain of guilt."

So zealous was he for her spiritual\nconcerns, that he would have been glad to hear she had actually taken\nthe veil; but he knew such a step was not at all agreeable to her\ndisposition, and that no violence would be offered to her inclinations\non that score, unless her stepmother should communicate to the father\nthat letter of Fathom’s which she had intercepted, and by which the\nGerman would be convinced of his daughter’s backsliding; but this\nmeasure, he rightly supposed, the wife would not venture to take, lest\nthe husband, instead of taking her advice touching the young lady,\nshould seek to compromise the affair, by offering her in marriage to\nher debaucher, a proffer which, if accepted, would overwhelm the mother\nwith vexation and despair. He therefore chose to trust to the effects\nof lenient time, which he hoped would gradually weaken the resentment\nof this Penthesilea, and dissolve his connexion with the other parts of\nthe family, from which he longed to be totally detached.How well soever he might have succeeded in his attempts to shake off\nthe yoke of the mother, who by her situation in life was restrained\nfrom prosecuting those measures her resentment had planned against his\nfortitude and indifference, he would have found greater difficulty than\nhe had foreseen, in disengaging himself from the daughter, whose\naffections he had won under the most solemn professions of honour and\nfidelity, and who, now she was debarred of his company and\nconversation, and in danger of losing him for ever, had actually taken\nthe resolution of disclosing the amour to her father, that he might\ninterpose in behalf of her peace and reputation, and secure her\nhappiness by the sanction of the church.CHAPTER EIGHTEENOUR HERO DEPARTS FROM VIENNA, AND QUITS THE DOMAIN OF VENUS FOR THE\nROUGH FIELD OF MARS.Luckily for our adventurer, before she adhered to this determination,\nthe young Count de Melvil was summoned to Presburg by his father, who\ndesired to see him, before he should take the field, in consequence of\na rupture between the Emperor and the French King; and Fathom of course\nquitted Vienna, in order to attend his patron, after he and Renaldo had\nresided two whole years in that capital, where the former had made\nhimself perfect in all the polite exercises, become master of the\nFrench tongue, and learned to speak the Italian with great facility;\nover and above those other accomplishments in which we have represented\nhim as an inimitable original."
