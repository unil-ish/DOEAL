The tumult of these emotions having a\nlittle subsided, and the Castilian being seated betwixt Renaldo and his\nbeauteous bride, he politely bespoke the indulgence of Madam Clement,\nbegging she would permit him to demand the performance of the Count’s\npromise, that he might be forthwith made acquainted with those\ncircumstances of his own fate which he was so impatient to learn.The lady having assured him, that she and all the company would take\npleasure in hearing the recapitulation, the Spaniard, addressing\nhimself to Melvil, “In the name of Heaven!” said he, “how could you\nsupplant that rival, who fell a sacrifice to my resentment, after he\nhad bewitched the heart of Serafina? for, sure, the affection he had\nkindled in her breast must have long survived his death,” “That rival,”\nreplied the Count, “who incurred your displeasure, was no other than\nRenaldo.” With these words, he applied to one eye a patch of black silk\nprovided for the purpose, and turning his face towards Don Diego, that\ngentleman started with astonishment, crying, “Good Heaven! the very\ncountenance of Orlando, whom I slew! this is still more amazing!”CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVEA RETROSPECTIVE LINK, NECESSARY FOR THE CONCATENATION OF THESE MEMOIRS."

  "content": "“Indulge me with a patient hearing,” proceeded the Hungarian, “and all\nthese riddles soon will be explained. Inflamed with the desire of\nseeing foreign countries, I disobeyed the will of an indulgent father,\nfrom whose house, withdrawing privately, I set out for Italy, in\ndisguise, by the way of Tyrol, visited Venice, Rome, Florence, and,\nembarking at Naples, in an English ship, arrived at St. Lucar, from\nwhence I repaired to Seville; there, in a few days, was my curiosity\nengaged by the fame of the fair Serafina, who was justly deemed the\nmost accomplished beauty in that part of Spain. Nay, blush not, gentle\ncreature! for by my hopes of heaven! thy charms were even injured by\nthe cold applause of that report. Nevertheless, I was warmly interested\nby the uncommon character, and eagerly longed to see this pattern of\nperfection. As Don Diego did not train her up in that restraint to\nwhich the Spanish ladies are subjected, I soon found an opportunity of\nseeing her at church; and no person here present will, I presume, doubt\nbut that I was instantly captivated by her beauty and deportment. Had I\nthought that Don Diego’s favour was unengaged, perhaps I should have\nfollowed the dictates of vanity and inexperience, and presented myself\nin my own character, among the crowd of her professed admirers. I knew\nher father had been an officer of distinguished rank and reputation,\nand did not doubt that he would have regarded a young soldier of\nunexceptionable pedigree, and, I will even add, of untainted fame. Nor\ndid I suppose my own father could have objected against such an\nadvantageous match; but, by dint of industrious inquiry, I learned,\nthat the divine Serafina was already betrothed to Don Manuel de\nMendoza, and this information overwhelmed me with despair.“After having revolved a thousand projects for retarding and preventing\nthat detested union, I resolved to avail myself of my talent for\ndrawing, and professed myself a master of that science, in hope of\nbeing employed by the father of Serafina, who, I knew, let slip no\nopportunity of improving his daughter’s education. Accordingly I had\nthe good fortune to attract his notice, was invited to his house,\nhonoured with his approbation, and furnished with unrestricted\nopportunities of conversing with the dear object of my love. The\npassion which her beauty had kindled was by the perfections of her mind\ninflamed to such a degree of transport, as could not be concealed from\nher penetration. She chanced to relish my conversation; I gradually\nacquired her friendship; pity was the next passion that she entertained\nin my favour. I then ventured to disclose myself, and the dear charmer\ndid not disapprove of my presumption. She and her mother had been\nperplexed with some religious scruples, concerning which they appealed\nto my opinion; and I was happy enough to set their minds at ease.“This sort of intercourse naturally created a mutual confidence among\nus; and, in a word, I was blessed with the daughter’s love and mother’s\napprobation. Don Diego will pardon these clandestine measures, which we\ntook, from a full persuasion that it was impossible to render him\npropitious to the views in which our hearts and hands were so deeply\ninterested. I did not then know how little he was addicted to\nsuperstition."

When the hour of appointment arrived, I repaired to the place\nat which I had proposed to enter the house, and stumbled, in the dark,\nover the body of a man still warm, and bleeding. Alarmed at this\noccurrence, I darted myself through the window, and rushing to the\napartment of the ladies, (immortal powers!) beheld the peerless\nSerafina, and her virtuous mother, stretched on a couch, and, in all\nappearance, deprived of life.“The company will easily conceive what agonies I felt at such a\nspectacle! I ran towards the spot in a transport of horror! I clasped\nmy lovely mistress in my arms, and, finding her still breathing,\nendeavoured, but in vain, to wake her from the trance Antonia was\noverwhelmed with the same lethargic power. My fancy was immediately\nstruck with the apprehension of their being poisoned. Regardless of my\nown situation, I alarmed the family, called for assistance, and\nrequested the servants to summon Don Diego to the dismal scene. I was\ninformed that their master had rode forth in manifest confusion; and\nwhile I pondered on this surprising excursion, an apothecary in the\nneighbourhood entered the chamber, and having examined the pulses of\nthe ladies, declared that their lives were in no danger, and advised\nthat they should be undressed, and conveyed to bed. While their women\nwere busied in this employment, I went into the court-yard, attended by\nsome of the servants with lights, in order to view the body of the man\nwhich I had found at my arrival. His apparel was mean, his countenance\nferocious; a long spado was buckled to his thigh, and, in his belt,\nwere stuck a brace of loaded pistols; so that we concluded he was some\nthief, who had waited for an opportunity, and seeing the casement open,\nintended to rob the house, but was prevented, and slain by Don Diego\nhimself, whose retreat, however, did not a little confound our\nconjecture. For my own part, I remained all night in the house,\ntortured with fear, vexation, and suspense."

The major-domo having waited several\nhours for his lord’s return, without seeing him appear, thought proper\nto despatch a messenger to Don Manuel, with an account of what had\nhappened; and that nobleman arriving in the morning, took possession of\nthe house. About four o’clock in the afternoon, Serafina began to stir,\nand, at five, she and her mother were perfectly awake.“They no sooner recovered the use of reflection, than they gave signs\nof equal sorrow and amazement, and earnestly called for Isabella, who\nwas privy to our design, and who, after a very minute inquiry, was\nfound in a lone and solitary chamber, where she had been confined. Such\nwas the confusion of the house, that no person ever dreamed of asking\nhow I entered, each domestic, in all probability, supposing I had been\nintroduced by his fellow; so that I tarried unquestioned, on pretence\nof concern for the distress of a family in which I had been so\ngenerously entertained, and, by Isabella, sent my respects and duty to\nher ladies. She was, therefore, not a little surprised, when, after\nevery other servant had withdrawn, she heard the lovely Serafina\nexclaim, with all the violence of grief, ‘Ah! Isabella, Orlando is no\nmore!’ But their astonishment was still greater, when she assured them\nof my being alive, and in the house. They recounted to her the\nadventure of last night, which she explained, by informing them of the\nletters which Don Diego had intercepted. And they immediately\nconcluded, that he had, in the precipitation of his wrath, killed, by\nmistake, the person who was found dead in the court-yard. This\nconjecture alarmed them on my account; they, by the medium of Isabella,\nconjured me to leave the house, lest Don Diego should return, and\naccomplish his resentment; and I was persuaded to withdraw, after I had\nsettled the channel of a correspondence with the confidant."

Inexpressible was the rage of Mendoza,\nwhen he heard of their elopement. He raved like one deprived of\nreason—swore he would put all the servants of the family to the\nrack—and, in consequence of the intelligence he obtained by threats and\npromises, set on foot a very strict inquiry, in order to apprehend the\nfugitives and Orlando, who had by some means or other incurred his\nsuspicion.“We eluded his search by the vigilance and caution of our kind host;\nand, while we remained in concealment, were extremely astonished to\nhear that the unfortunate Don Diego was proclaimed a traitor, and a\nprice set upon his head. This information overwhelmed us all with the\nutmost affliction. Antonia lamented, without ceasing, the disgrace of\nher beloved lord, from whom she never would have withdrawn herself, but\nwith the lively hope of a reconciliation, after the first transports of\nhis ire should have subsided, and the real character of Orlando should\nhave appeared. It was not long before we had reason to believe that\nMendoza was the accuser of Don Diego—“Nay, start not, Signior; Manuel was actually that traitor! This was\nthe turn of his revenge! when he found himself disappointed in the hope\nof possessing the incomparable Serafina, he took a base advantage of\nyour absence and retreat. He posted to Madrid, impeached you to the\nsecretary of state of having maintained a criminal correspondence with\nthe enemies of Spain, included me in his accusation, as a spy for the\nhouse of Austria, and framed such a plausible tale, from the\ncircumstances of your distress, that Don Diego was outlawed, and\nMendoza gratified with a grant of his estate.“These melancholy incidents made a deep impression upon the mind of the\nvirtuous Antonia, who waiving every other consideration, would have\npersonally appeared for the vindication of her husband’s honour, had\nnot we dissuaded her from such a rash undertaking, by demonstrating her\ninability to contend with such a powerful antagonist; and representing\nthat her appearance would be infallibly attended with the ruin of\nSerafina, who would certainly fall into the hands of the villain to\nwhom she had been contracted. We exhorted her to wait patiently for\nsome happy revolution of fortune, and encouraged her with the hope of\nDon Diego’s exerting himself effectually in his own defence."

Antonia still continued to pine over the ruin of her house; as she\ncould hear no tidings of Don Diego, she concluded he was dead, and\nmourned with unabating sorrow. In vain I assured her, that, soon as my\nown affairs should be adjusted, I would exert my whole endeavours to\nfind and succour him. She could not imagine that a man of his spirit\nand disposition would live so long in obscurity. And her affliction\nderived new force from the death of the consul’s widow, with whom she\nhad lived in the most unbounded intimacy and friendship. From that day,\nher health evidently declined. She foresaw her dissolution, and\ncomforted herself with the hope of seeing her husband and her friend in\na place where no treachery is felt, and no sorrow is known; confident\nof my integrity, and the purity of my love, she, in the most pathetic\nterms, recommended Serafina to my care.“Ha! weepest thou, fair excellence, at the remembrance of that tender\nscene, when the good Antonia, on the bed of death, joined thy soft hand\nto mine, and said, ‘Renaldo, I bequeath this orphan to your love; it is\na sacred pledge, which, if you cherish with due honour and regard,\ninternal peace and happiness will ever smile within your bosom; but if\nyou treat it with indifference, dishonour, or neglect, just Heaven will\npunish your breach of trust with everlasting disappointments and\ndisquiet.’“Signior Don Diego, I see you are moved, and therefore will not dwell\non such distressful circumstances. The excellent Antonia exchanged this\nlife for a more happy state; and so exquisite was the sorrow of the\ntender-hearted Serafina, as to torture me with the apprehension that\nshe would not long survive her pious mother. How I obeyed the\ninjunctions of that departing saint, Monimia (for that name she now\nassumed) can testify, until that artful serpent Fathom glided into our\nmutual confidence, abused our ears, poisoned our unsuspected faith, and\neffected that fatal breach, productive of all the misery and vexation\nwhich we have suffered, and which is now so happily expelled.”“Heaven,” said the Castilian, “hath visited me for the sins and errors\nof my youth; yet, such mercy hath been mingled with its chastisements,\nI dare not murmur or repine. The tears of penitence and sorrow shall\nwater my Antonia’s grave; as for Mendoza, I rejoice at his treachery,\nby which the obligation of my promise is cancelled, and my honour fully\nacquitted. He shall not triumph in his guilt. My services, my\ncharacter, and innocence shall soon confront his perfidy, and, I hope,\ndefeat his interest. The King is just and gracious, nor is my family\nand name unknown.”"

At the same\ntime Don Diego was summoned to present himself before the King within a\nlimited time, to answer to the charge which Mendoza had brought against\nhim.The Spaniard’s heart overflowed with gratitude and joy, when he read\nthis intimation; he embraced the Jew, who, before Zelos could give\nutterance to his thoughts, told him that the Spanish Ambassador at\nLondon, having been prepossessed in his favour, craved the honour of\nseeing Don Diego; and that he, Joshua, was ready to conduct him to the\nhouse.“Then is my heart at rest!” cried the Castilian; “the house of Zelos\nonce more shall lift up its head.

O\nmy children! this day is replete with such joy and satisfaction, as I\ndid not think had been in the power of Heaven to grant, without the\ninterposition of a miracle! To you, Renaldo, to you illustrious lady,\nand to these worthy gentlemen, am I indebted for the restoration of\nthat for which alone I wish to live; and when my heart ceases to retain\nthe obligation, may I forfeit the name of a Castilian, and scorn and\ndishonour be my portion.”Perhaps all Europe could not produce another company so happy as that\nwhich now sat down to dinner in the house of Madam Clement, whose own\nbenevolent heart was peculiarly adapted for such enjoyment. The lovers\nfeasted their eyes more than their appetite, by a tender intercourse of\nglances, which needed not the slow interpretation of speech; while the\nSpaniard regarded them alternately with looks of wonder and paternal\njoy, and every individual surveyed the all-deserving pair with\nadmiration and esteem."

Fraught with this\ninstruction, the Israelite desired a private audience of the Castilian,\nin which, after an apology for the freedom of his demand, “Signior Don\nDiego,” said he, “as your fortune hath been so long embezzled by your\nadversary in Spain, and your correspondence with that country entirely\ncut off, it is not to be supposed that your finances are at present in\nsuch a condition as to maintain the splendour of your family.

Money is the chief commodity in which I deal, and, if you\nhonour me with your commands, I shall be a gainer by my obedience.”Don Diego replied, with a smile that denoted how well he understood the\nmeaning of this address, “Surely, Signior, I am bound by the strongest\nties to exert my utmost endeavours for your advantage; and I pray God\nthis your proposal may have that issue. I am well acquainted with the\nCount’s generosity and refined notions of honour; and too much obliged\nby him already, to hesitate with punctilious reserve in accepting his\nfuture assistance.

Although the Spaniard had been accustomed to the\nuncommon generosity of Melvil, he could not help wondering at this\nnobleness of behaviour, so little to be expected from any merchant,\nmuch less from a Jewish broker.While this affair was on the anvil, Renaldo, who could no longer\nwithhold the communication of his happiness from his sister and\nrelations in Germany, took up the pen, and, in a letter to his\nbrother-in-law, recounted all the circumstances of the surprising turn\nof fate which he had experienced since his arrival in England.

Serafina was\ndressed in a sack of white satin, and the ornaments of her head were\nadjusted in the Spanish fashion, which gave a peculiar air to her\nappearance, and an additional spirit to those attractions which engaged\nthe heart of each beholder. There was nothing remarkable in the habit\nof Renaldo, who had copied the plainness and elegance of his mistress;\nbut, when she entered the place, his features were animated with a\ndouble proportion of vivacity, and their eyes meeting, seemed to kindle\na blaze which diffused warmth and joy through the countenances of all\npresent.After a short pause, her father led her to the altar, and gave her away\nto the transported Renaldo, before the priest who performed the\nceremony, and bestowed the nuptial benediction on this enraptured pair.\nThe sanction of the church being thus obtained, they withdrew into the\nvestry, where Melvil sealed his title on her rosy lips, and presented\nhis wife to the company, who embraced her in their turns, with fervent\nwishes for their mutual happiness.Though the scene of this transaction was remote from any inhabited\nneighbourhood, the church was surrounded by a crowd of people, who,\nwith uncommon demonstration of surprise and admiration, petitioned\nHeaven to bless so fair a couple. Such indeed was their eagerness to\nsee them, that some lives were endangered by the pressure of the crowd,\nwhich attended them with loud acclamations to the coach, after the\nbridegroom had deposited in the hands of the minister one hundred\npounds for the benefit of the poor of that parish, and thrown several\nhandfuls of money among the multitude.

They had drunk tea, and engaged in a\nparty at whist, when they were surprised with a noise of contention\nfrom a public-house, that fronted the windows of the apartment in which\nthey sat. Alarmed at this uproar, they forsook their cards, and,\nthrowing up the casement, beheld a hearse surrounded by four men on\nhorseback, who had stopped the carriage, and violently pulled the\ndriver from his seat. This uncommon arrest had engaged the curiosity of\nthe publican’s family, who stood at the door to observe the\nconsequence, when all of a sudden appeared a person in canonicals, well\nmounted, who, riding up to those who maltreated the driver, bestowed\nupon one of them such a blow with the butt-end of his whip, as laid him\nsprawling on the ground; and, springing from his saddle upon the box,\ntook the reins into his own hand, swearing with great vehemence, that\nhe would murder every man who should attempt to obstruct the hearse.The good priest who had married Renaldo was not a little scandalised at\nthis ferocious behaviour in a clergyman, and could not help saying\naloud, he was a disgrace to the cloth when the horseman looking up to\nthe window, replied, “Sir, may I be d—n’d, if any man in England has a\ngreater respect for the cloth than I have; but at present I am quite\ndistracted.” So saying, he whipped up the horses, and had actually\ndisentangled the hearse from those who surrounded it, when he was\nopposed by another troop, one of whom alighted with great expedition,\nand cut the harness so as that he could not possibly proceed. Finding\nhimself thus driven to bay, he leaped upon the ground, and exercised\nhis weapon with such amazing strength and agility, that several of his\nantagonists were left motionless on the field, before he was\noverpowered and disarmed by dint of numbers, who assailed him on all\nsides.The mad parson being thus taken prisoner, an elderly person, of a very\nprepossessing appearance, went up to the hearse, and, unbolting the\ndoor, a young lady sprung out, and shrieking, ran directly to the\npublic-house, to the infinite astonishment and affright of the whole\nfamily, who believed it was the spirit of the deceased person, whose\nbody lay in the carriage. Renaldo, who was with difficulty restrained\nfrom interposing in behalf of the clergyman against such odds, no\nsooner perceived this apparition, than, supposing her to be some\ndistressed damsel, his Quixotism awoke, he descended in an instant, and\nrushed into the house, among those that pursued the fair phantom.

The old gentleman thanked them for their courtesy, which he did\nnot think proper to refuse, and while he led, or rather hauled\nMademoiselle over the way, under the auspices of the Castilian, Renaldo\nset the lover at liberty, made him a tender of his good offices, and\nadvised him to wait at the public-house for an happy issue of their\nnegotiation.The pseudo-parson was very much affected by this generous proffer, for\nwhich he made suitable acknowledgments, and protested before God he\nwould die a thousand deaths rather than part with his dear Charlotte.\nHer father no sooner entered the apartment, than he was known by Joshua\nto be a considerable trader in the city of London, and the merchant was\nglad to find himself among his acquaintance. He was so full of the\nstory which had brought him thither, that he had scarce sat down when\nhe began to complain of his hard fate, in having an only child who was\nso mean, stubborn, and contumacious; and every sentence was concluded\nwith an apostrophe of reproaches to the delinquent.The Jew having allowed him to ring out his alarm, condoled his\nmisfortune, and gravely counselled the young lady to wean her\naffections from such an unworthy object, for he supposed her favourite\nwas a man of no principle, or liberal endowments, otherwise her father\nwould not exclaim so bitterly against her conduct. Charlotte, who\nwanted neither beauty nor understanding, assured him that her lover’s\ncharacter was, in all respects, unblemished, for the truth of which\nassertion she appealed to her papa, who owned, with reluctance, that\nthe young man was a gentleman by birth, that he had served him with\nremarkable diligence and integrity, and that his accomplishments were\nfar superior to his station in life. “But then,” said he, “the fellow\nhas not a shilling of his own, and would you have me give away my\ndaughter to a beggar?”"

  "content": "“God forbid!” cried the Jew, “I always understood you possessed an\nample fortune, and am sorry to find it otherwise.” “Otherwise!” cried\nthe citizen, with some acrimony, “take care what you say, sir; a\nmerchant’s credit is not to be tampered with.” “I beg your pardon,”\nanswered the Hebrew, “I concluded that your circumstances were bad,\nbecause you objected to the poverty of the young man after you had\nowned he was possessed of every other qualification to make your\ndaughter happy; for it is not to be imagined that you would thwart her\ninclinations, or seek to render an only child miserable on account of\nan obstacle which you yourself could easily remove. Let us suppose you\ncan afford to give with your daughter ten thousand pounds, which would\nenable this young man to live with credit and reputation, and engage\nadvantageously in trade, for which you say he is well qualified, the\nalternative then will be, whether you would rather see her in the arms\nof a deserving youth whom she loves, enjoying all the comforts of life\nwith a moderate fortune, which it will always be in your own power to\nimprove, or tied for life to a monied man whom she detests, cursing her\nhard fate, and despising that superfluity of wealth, in spite of which\nshe finds herself so truly wretched.”The old gentleman seemed to be startled at this observation, which was\nreinforced by Renaldo’s saying, that he would, moreover, enjoy the\nunutterable pleasure of giving happiness to a worthy man, whose\ngratitude would co-operate with his love, in approving himself a\ndutiful son, as well as an affectionate husband. He then represented\nthe family disquiets and dismal tragedies produced from such mercenary\nand compulsive matches, and, in conclusion related the story of Don\nDiego and his daughter, which when the merchant heard, he started up\nwith marks of terror in his countenance, and, throwing up the casement,\ncalled upon Valentine with great vociferation. This was the name of his\ndaughter’s admirer, who no sooner heard the summons than he flew to the\nspot from whence it came, and the merchant, without any further\npreamble, seizing his hand, joined it with that of Charlotte, saying,\nwith great trepidation, “Here, take her, in the name of God, and thank\nthis honourable company for your good fortune.”The lovers were transported with exquisite joy at this sudden\ndetermination in their favour. Valentine, having kissed the hand of his\nmistress with all the eagerness of rapture, and acknowledged the\nmerchant’s generosity, paid his respects to the ladies with a very\npolite address, and with demonstrations of uncommon gratitude and\nsensibility, thanked the gentlemen, and the Count in particular, for\ntheir good offices, to which he attributed the happiness he now\nenjoyed. While Serafina and Madam Clement caressed the amiable\nCharlotte, the rest of the company congratulated her admirer upon his\nchoice and success, though the clergyman could not help reprehending\nhim for profaning the sacerdotal habit."

  "content": "Valentine heartily asked pardon for having given such cause of offence,\nand hoped he should be forgiven, as it was a disguise which he thought\nabsolutely necessary for the execution of a scheme upon which his\nhappiness depended. He then, at the request of Renaldo, unfolded the\nmystery of the hearse, by giving them to understand that Charlotte’s\nfather having got inkling of their mutual passion, had dismissed his\nclerk, and conveyed his daughter to a country-house in the\nneighbourhood of London, in order to cut off their correspondence;\nnotwithstanding these precautions they had found means to communicate\nwith each other by letters, which were managed by a third person; and\nhis rival being very importunate in his solicitations, they had\nconcerted the expedient of the hearse, which he provided and conducted\nthrough a road contiguous to the end of the merchant’s garden, where\nCharlotte, being apprised of the design, waited for its approach, and\nembarked in it without hesitation. Valentine thought himself\nsufficiently screened from discovery by his disguise, but he was\nunfortunately met by a servant of the family, who recollected his\nfeatures, and immediately gave the alarm, upon which the father and his\nfriends took horse, and pursued them by two different roads, until they\nwere overtaken at this place.He had scarce finished this short relation, when his rival, bluntly\nentering the apartment, with an handkerchief tied round his eye,\ncommitted Valentine to the charge of a constable, who attended him, by\na warrant from a justice of the peace in that neighbourhood, and\nthreatened to prosecute the merchant on an action of damages for the\nloss of an eye, which he said he had sustained in his service. The\ncompany endeavoured to appease this citizen, by representing that his\nmisfortune was no other than a common inflammation, nor was it owing to\nmalice aforethought, but entirely to the precipitate passion of an\nincensed young man, who, by the bye, acted in his own defence. At the\nsame time the merchant promised to make any reasonable satisfaction,\nupon which the other demanded an obligation, importing that he would,\nin ten days from the date, bestow upon him his daughter in marriage,\nwith a portion of fifteen thousand pounds, or, in case of failure, pay\nhim double the sum.The merchant, exasperated at this extravagant demand, told him flatly\nhe had already disposed of his daughter to Valentine, who, he believed,\nwas a much more deserving man, and that he was ready to wait upon the\nmagistrate who had granted the warrant, in order to give bail for his\nfuture son-in-law. This was a mortifying declaration to the plaintiff,\nthough he condoled himself with the hope of being a gainer by the loss\nof his eye, and now the pain was over would have been very sorry to\nfind his sight retrieved. The old gentleman, Joshua, and Renaldo\naccompanied the prisoner to the house of the justice, where he was\nimmediately admitted to bail. Upon their return Valentine shifted his\ndress, and they supped together with great cordiality and mirth,\nmaintained at the expense of the discarded lover."

  "content": "After supper Don Diego walked a minuet with Madam Clement; for whom, by\nthis time, he had contracted an extraordinary degree of affection.\nValentine had the honour to dance with the incomparable Serafina, whose\nbeauty and attractions dazzled the eyes of the new-comers, and struck\nher bashful partner with awe and confusion; and Melvil presented his\nhand to the agreeable Charlotte, who performed so much to the\nsatisfaction of her father, that he could not help expressing his joy\nand pride. He praised God for throwing him in the way of our company,\nand engaged the clergyman to unite the young couple, after having\nappointed a day for the ceremony, and invited all present to the\nwedding. The evening having been insensibly consumed in these\navocations, and the night pretty far advanced, the ladies withdrew\nwithout ceremony; and the retreat of Serafina filled Renaldo’s breast\nwith tumult and emotion; his blood began to flow in impetuous tides,\nhis heart to beat with redoubled vigour and velocity, while his eyes\nseemed to flash with more than human splendour. Now his imagination\nbegan to anticipate with the enthusiastic rage of an inspired sibyl; he\nwas instantaneously transported from the conversation, and every nerve\nwas braced to such a degree of impatience, that human nature could not\nlong endure the tension.He, therefore, having withstood the impulse about a quarter of an hour,\nat length gave way to his impetuosity, and, springing from his friends,\nfound himself in a dark passage, at the farther end of which he\nperceived Madam Clement coming out of a chamber with a light, which, at\nsight of him, she set down, and vanished in a moment. This was the star\nthat pointed to his paradise; he hailed the signal, entered the\napartment, and, like a lion, rushing on his prey, approached the\nnuptial bed, where Serafina, surrounded by all the graces of beauty,\nsoftness, sentiment, and truth, lay trembling as a victim at the altar,\nand strove to hide her blushes from his view—the door was shut, the\nlight extinguished—he owned his lot was more than mortal man could\nclaim.Here let me draw the decent veil that ought to shade the secret\nmysteries of Hymen. Away, unhallowed scoffers, who profane, with idle\npleasantry or immodest hint, these holy rites; and leave those happy\nlovers to enjoy, in one another’s arms, unutterable bliss, the\nwell-earned palm of virtue and of constancy, which had undergone the\nmost severe refinement. A more deserving pair night’s curtain shrouds\nnot in its dark extent.The thoughts of Renaldo’s felicity threw a damp on the spirits of\nValentine, who saw the term of his probation protracted a few days\nlonger, and could not help wishing in his heart that he had achieved\nthe adventure which would have abridged his expectation, though at the\nexpense of the old gentleman’s displeasure. He filled a bumper to the\nhealth of the bride and bridegroom, and throwing up his eyes with marks\nof admiration, exclaimed, “How happy is the Count! alas! five days\nlonger must I rein my impatience!” “It is but reasonable, you rogue,\nthat your betters should have the start of you,” said the merchant, who\ndid him justice in the glass, and counselled him to drown his\nimpatience with good claret. The youth followed his advice, and it was\nlate before the company retired to rest."

  "content": "These citizens, however, resolved to seize an opportunity of rallying\nthe new-married couple, according to custom, and with that view arose\nearly in the morning, on the supposition of finding them still asleep;\nbut they were not a little surprised, when they entered the\nbreakfasting room, to see Renaldo, and his amiable bed-fellow, already\ndressed, and awaiting to do the honours of the house. The old gentleman\nwould fain have cracked a joke upon their extraordinary despatch, but\nhe was so much overawed by the dignity and tamed by the sweetness of\nSerafina’s carriage, that he durst not give utterance to his\nconception; and Valentine stood silent and abashed, as in the presence\nof a superior being. After breakfast these gentlemen and Charlotte\nagain expressed their sense of the obligations they owed to this happy\nfamily, repeated their invitation, and, taking leave, returned to\nLondon in a coach that was provided overnight.Our friends being thus left to themselves, Don Diego turned towards\nMelvil: “Now,” said he, “that I have yielded to the impatience of your\nlove, as well as to the eagerness of my own desire to make you happy, I\nmust beg leave to interrupt, for a little while, the stream of your\nmutual pleasure, and propose a melancholy excursion, which, however,\nwill not be wholly void of enjoyment. I have too long delayed the\nperformance of my duty at Antonia’s grave—let us spend the forenoon in\nthat pious pilgrimage—I will drop a few tears to the memory of that\nexcellent woman, and never afterwards shall my friends be troubled with\nmy grief.”The proposal being universally approved, they set out for the place,\nwhich had oft been visited by the gentle Serafina, who conducted her\nfather to a black marble stone, which Renaldo had ordered to be laid\nover the grave; and, as he kneeled to kiss the monument, he perceived\nthis plain inscription in the Spanish tongue:—Antonia de Zelos primera\nen todo lo que es ser bueno, y sin segundo en todo lo que fue ser\ndesdichado, quedad con Dios! that is, Antonia de Zelos, unmatched in\nvirtue, and unequalled in misfortune, adieu! “O faithful record!” cried\nthe Castilian, smiting his breast, while his tears distilled upon the\nmarble, “thy goodness was the gift of Heaven, but thy misfortunes were\nderived from the guilt of Don Diego; yet his sorrow shall expiate his\noffence, and his penitence find favour in the sight of Heaven! Rest,\nrest, ill-fated virtue!—eternal peace shall guard thy tomb, and angels\nminister to thy unspotted shade; nor shall thine ashes lie in dark\nobscurity here will I raise a monument, more suited to thy excellence\nand name.” Serafina melted with filial tenderness; nor were the rest\nunmoved at this affecting scene, which Don Diego did not quit without\nreluctance.CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVENTHE LONGEST AND THE LAST."

  "content": "The nature of this visit had softened every heart, and saddened every\ncountenance; and they walked in solemn silence to the other side of the\nchurch-yard, in order to regain their carriages; when, at the turning\nof the stile, they saw a young woman, in wretched attire, running out\nof a poor habitation, wringing her hands in all the agony of despair.\nNotwithstanding the distraction in her countenance, and the meanness of\nher apparel, she discovered a regularity of features, and a delicacy of\nair, which did not at all correspond with the misery of her equipage.\nThese exhibitions of extreme distress soon attracted the notice and\ncompassion of our company, and Melvil’s beauteous help-mate, accosting\nthis forlorn damsel with a pity-breathing aspect, asked the cause of\nher disorder.“Alas! dear lady,” cried the other, with all the emphasis of woe, “an\nunhappy gentleman now breathes his last within this inhospitable hovel,\namidst such excess of misery as would melt the most flinty bosom. What\nthen must I feel, who am connected with him by the strongest ties of\nlove and conjugal affection?” “Who is the unfortunate object?” said the\nphysician. “He was once well known in the gay world,” replied the young\nwoman; “his name is Fathom.” Every individual of the company started at\nmention of that detested name. Serafina began to tremble with emotion;\nand Renaldo, after a short pause, declared he would go in, not with a\nview to exult over his misery, but in order to contemplate the\ncatastrophe of such a wicked life, that the moral might be the more\ndeeply engraved on his remembrance. The young Countess, whose tender\nheart could not bear the shock of such a spectacle, retired to the\ncoach with Madam Clement and the Jew, while Renaldo, accompanied by the\nrest, entered a dismal apartment, altogether void of furniture and\nconvenience, where they beheld the wretched hero of these memoirs\nstretched almost naked upon straw, insensible, convulsed, and seemingly\nin the grasp of death. He was worn to the bone either by famine or\ndistemper; his face was overshadowed with hair and filth; his eyes were\nsunk, glazed, and distorted; his nostrils dilated; his lips covered\nwith a black slough; and his complexion faded into a pale clay-colour,\ntending to a yellow hue. In a word, the extremity of indigence,\nsqualor, and distress could not be more feelingly represented."
