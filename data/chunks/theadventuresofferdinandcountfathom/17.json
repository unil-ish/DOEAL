Melvil had arrayed himself in a suit of deep mourning, and he\nfound the good lady in the like habit, assumed upon the same occasion.\nThe goodness of her heart was manifest in her countenance; the\nsensibility of the youth discovered itself in a flood of tears, which\nhe shed at her appearance. His sensations were too full for utterance;\nnor was she, for some time, able to give him welcome. While she led him\nby the hand to a seat, the drops of sympathy rushed into either eye;\nand at length she broke silence, saying, “Count, we must acquiesce in\nthe dispensations of Providence; and quiet the transports of our grief,\nwith a full assurance that Monimia is happy.”This name was the key that unlocked the faculty of his speech. “I must\nstrive,” said he, “to ease the anguish of my heart with that\nconsolation. But say, humane, benevolent lady, to whose compassion and\ngenerosity that hapless orphan was indebted for the last peaceful\nmoment she enjoyed upon earth; say, in all your acquaintance with human\nnature, in all your intercourse with the daughters of men, in all the\nexercise of your charity and beneficence, did you ever observe such\nsweetness, purity, and truth; such beauty, sense, and perfection, as\nthat which was the inheritance of her whose fate I shall for ever\ndeplore?”—“She was, indeed,” replied the lady, “the best and fairest of\nour sex.”"

The intelligence he obtained on\nthis occasion added indignation to his grief. The whole mystery of\nMonimia’s behaviour, which he could not before explain, now stood\ndisclosed before him. He saw the gradual progress of that infernal plan\nwhich had been laid for their mutual ruin; and his soul was inflamed\nwith such desire of vengeance, that he would have taken his leave\nabruptly, in order to set on foot an immediate inquiry about the\nperfidious author of his wrongs, that he might exterminate such a\nmonster of iniquity from the face of the earth. But he was restrained\nby Madam Clement, who gave him to understand, that Fathom was already\novertaken by the vengeance of Heaven; for she had traced him in all the\ncourse of his fortune, from his first appearance in the medical sphere\nto his total eclipse. She represented the villain as a wretch\naltogether unworthy of his attention. She said, he was so covered with\ninfamy, that no person could enter the lists against him, without\nbearing away some stain of dishonour; that he was, at present,\npeculiarly protected by the law, and sheltered from the resentment of\nRenaldo, in the cavern of his disgrace.Melvil, glowing with rage, replied, that he was a venomous serpent,\nwhich it was incumbent on every foot to crush; that it was the duty of\nevery man to contribute his whole power in freeing society from such a\npernicious hypocrite; and that, if such instances of perfidy and\ningratitude were suffered to pass with impunity, virtue and\nplain-dealing would soon be expelled from the habitations of men. “Over\nand above these motives,” said he, “I own myself so vitiated with the\nalloy of human passion and infirmity, that I desire—I eagerly pant for\nan occasion of meeting him hand to hand, where I may upbraid him with\nhis treachery, and shower down vengeance and destruction on his\nperfidious head.”Then he recounted the anecdotes of our adventurer which he had learned\nin Germany and Flanders, and concluded with declaring his unalterable\nresolution of releasing him from jail, that he might have an\nopportunity of sacrificing him, with his own hand, to the manes of\nMonimia. The discreet lady, perceiving the perturbation of his mind,\nwould not further combat the impetuosity of his passion; contenting\nherself with exacting a promise, that he would not execute his purpose,\nuntil he should have deliberated three days upon the consequences by\nwhich a step of that kind might be attended. Before the expiration of\nthat term, she thought measures might be taken to prevent the young\ngentleman from exposing his life or reputation to unnecessary hazard."

  "content": "Having complied with her request in this particular, he took his leave,\nafter he had, by repeated entreaties, prevailed upon her to accept a\njewel, in token of his veneration for the kind benefactress of the\ndeceased Monimia; nor could his generous heart be satisfied, until he\nhad forced a considerable present on the humane physician who had\nattended her in her last moments, and now discovered a particular\nsympathy and concern for her desponding lover. This gentleman attended\nhim to the house of the benevolent Joshua, where they dined, and where\nDon Diego was recommended, in the most fervid terms of friendship, to\nthe good offices of their host. Not that this duty was performed in\npresence of the stranger—Renaldo’s delicacy would not expose his friend\nto such a situation. While the physician, before dinner, entertained\nthat stranger in one apartment, Melvil withdrew into another, with the\nJew, to whom he disclosed the affair of the Castilian, with certain\ncircumstances, which shall, in due time, be revealed.Joshua’s curiosity being whetted by this information, he could not help\neyeing the Spaniard at table with such a particular stare, that Don\nDiego perceived his attention, and took umbrage at the freedom of his\nregard. Being unable to conceal his displeasure, he addressed himself\nto the Hebrew, with great solemnity, in the Spanish tongue, saving,\n“Signior, is there any singularity in my appearance? or, do you\nrecollect the features of Don Diego de Zelos?”“Signior Don Diego,” replied the other in pure Castilian, “I crave your\npardon for the rudeness of my curiosity, which prompted me to survey a\nnobleman, whose character I revere, and to whose misfortunes I am no\nstranger. Indeed, were curiosity alone concerned, I should be without\nexcuse; but as I am heartily inclined to serve you, as far as my weak\nabilities extend, I hope your generosity will not impute any little\ninvoluntary trespass of punctilio to my want of cordiality or esteem.”The Spaniard was not only appeased by this apology, but also affected\nwith the compliment, and the language in which it was conveyed. He\nthanked the Jew for his kind declaration, entreated him to bear, with\nthe peevishness of a disposition sore with the galling hand of\naffliction; and, turning up his eyes to Heaven, “Were it possible,”\ncried he, “for fate to reconcile contradictions, and recall the\nirremediable current of events, I would now believe that there was\nhappiness still in reserve for the forlorn Zelos, now that I tread the\nland of freedom and humanity, now that I find myself befriended by the\nmost generous of men. Alas! I ask not happiness! If, by the kind\nendeavours of the gallant Count de Melvil, to whom I am already\nindebted for my life, and by the efforts of his friends, the honour of\nmy name shall be purified and cleared from the poisonous stains of\nmalice by which it is at present spotted, I shall then enjoy all that\nsatisfaction which destiny can bestow upon a wretch whose woes are\nincurable.”"

It was, indeed, a sort of pleasure, the\nprospect of which enabled him to bear the toil of living through the\nday, though his patience was almost quite exhausted before the hour of\nassignation arrived.When the doctor appeared with the coach, he leaped into it with great\neagerness, after he had, with much difficulty, prevailed with Don Diego\nto stay at home, on account of his health, which was not yet perfectly\nestablished. The Castilian, however, would not comply with his request,\nuntil he had obtained the Count’s promise, that he should be permitted\nto accompany him next night, and take that duty alternately with the\nphysician.About midnight, they reached the place, where they found the sexton in\nwaiting, according to the orders he had received. The door was opened,\nthe mourner conducted to the tomb, and left, as before, to the gloom of\nhis own meditations. Again he laid himself on the cold ground; again he\nrenewed his lamentable strain; his imagination began to be heated into\nan ecstasy of enthusiasm, during which he again fervently invoked the\nspirit of his deceased Monimia.In the midst of these invocations, his ear was suddenly invaded with\nthe sound of some few solemn notes issuing from the organ, which seemed\nto feel the impulse of an invisible hand.At this awful salutation, Melvil was roused to the keenest sense of\nsurprise and attention. Reason shrunk before the thronging ideas of his\nfancy, which represented this music as the prelude to something strange\nand supernatural; and, while he waited for the sequel, the place was\nsuddenly illuminated, and each surrounding object brought under the\ncognisance of his eye."

He had mechanically raised himself upon one knee, with his\nbody advancing forwards; and in this attitude he gazed with a look\nthrough which his soul seemed eager to escape. To his view, thus\nstrained upon vacant space, in a few minutes appeared the figure of a\nwoman arrayed in white, with a veil that covered her face, and flowed\ndown upon her back and shoulders. The phantom approached him with an\neasy step, and, lifting up her veil, discovered (believe it, O reader!)\nthe individual countenance of Monimia.At sight of these well-known features, seemingly improved with new\ncelestial graces, the youth became a statue, expressing amazement,\nlove, and awful adoration. He saw the apparition smile with meek\nbenevolence, divine compassion, warm and intendered by that fond pure\nflame which death could not extinguish. He heard the voice of his\nMonimia call Renaldo! Thrice he essayed to answer; as oft his tongue\ndenied its office. His hair stood upright, and a cold vapour seemed to\nthrill through every nerve. This was not fear, but the infirmity of\nhuman nature, oppressed by the presence of a superior being."

  "content": "At length his agony was overcome. He recollected all his resolution,\nand, in a strain of awestruck rapture, thus addressed the heavenly\nvisitant: “Hast thou then heard, pure spirit! the wailings of my grief?\nhast thou descended from the realms of bliss, in pity to my woe? and\nart thou come to speak the words of peace to my desponding soul? To bid\nthe wretched smile, to lift the load of misery and care from the\nafflicted breast; to fill thy lover’s heart with joy and pleasing hope,\nwas still the darling task of my Monimia, ere yet refined to that\nperfection which mortality can never attain. No wonder then, blessed\nshade, that now, when reunited to thy native heaven, thou art still\nkind, propitious, and beneficent to us, who groan in this inhospitable\nvale of sorrow thou hast left. Tell me, ah! tell me, dost thou still\nremember those fond hours we passed together? Doth that enlightened\nbosom feel a pang of soft regret, when thou recallest our fatal\nseparation? Sure that meekened glance bespeaks thy sympathy! Ah! how\nthat tender look o’erpowers me! Sacred Heaven! the pearly drops of pity\ntrickle down thy cheeks! Such are the tears that angels shed o’er man’s\ndistress!—Turn not away—Thou beckonest me to follow. Yes, I will follow\nthee, ethereal spirit, as far as these weak limbs, encumbered with\nmortality, will bear my weight; and, would to Heaven! I could, with\nease, put off these vile corporeal shackles, and attend thy flight.”So saying, he started from the ground, and, in a transport of eager\nexpectation, at awful distance, traced the footsteps of the apparition,\nwhich, entering a detached apartment, sunk down upon a chair, and with\na sigh exclaimed, “Indeed, this is too much!” What was the disorder of\nRenaldo’s mind, when he perceived this phenomenon! Before reflection\ncould perform its office, moved by a sudden impulse, he sprung\nforwards, crying, “If it be death to touch thee, let me die!” and\ncaught in his arms, not the shadow, but the warm substance of the\nall-accomplished Monimia. “Mysterious powers of Providence! this is no\nphantom! this is no shade! this is the life! the panting bosom of her\nwhom I have so long, so bitterly deplored! I fold her in my arms! I\npress her glowing breast to mine! I see her blush with virtuous\npleasure and ingenuous love! She smiles upon me with enchanting\ntenderness! O let me gaze on that transcendent beauty, which, the more\nI view it, ravishes the more! These charms are too intense; I sicken\nwhile I gaze! Merciful Heaven! is not this a mere illusion of the\nbrain? Was she not fled for ever? Had not the cold hand of death\ndivorced her from my hope? This must be some flattering vision of my\ndistempered fancy! perhaps some soothing dream— If such it be, grant, O\nye heavenly powers! that I may never wake.”“O gentle youth!” replied the beauteous orphan, still clasped in his\nembrace, “what joy now fills the bosom of Monimia, at this triumph of\nthy virtue and thy love? When I see these transports of thy affection,\nwhen I find thee restored to that place in my esteem and admiration,\nwhich thou hadst lost by the arts of calumny and malice—this is a\nmeeting which my most sanguine hopes durst not presage!”"

  "content": "So entirely were the faculties of Renaldo engrossed in the\ncontemplation of his restored Monimia, that he saw not the rest of the\ncompany, who wept with transport over this affecting scene. He was\ntherefore amazed at the interposition of Madam Clement, who, while the\nshower of sympathetic pleasure bedewed her cheeks, congratulated the\nlovers upon this happy event, crying, “These are the joys which virtue\ncalls her own.” They also received the compliments of a reverend\nclergyman, who told Monimia, she had reaped, at last, the fruits of\nthat pious resignation to the will of Heaven, which she had so devoutly\npractised during the term of her affliction. And, lastly, they were\naccosted by the physician, who was not quite so hackneyed in the ways\nof death, or so callous to the finer sensations of the soul, but that\nhe blubbered plentifully, wile he petitioned Heaven in behalf of such\nan accomplished and deserving pair.Monimia taking Madam Clement by the hand, “Whatever joy,” said she,\n“Renaldo derives from this occasion, is owing to the bounty, the\ncompassion, and maternal care of this incomparable lady, together with\nthe kind admonitions and humanity of those two worthy gentlemen.”Melvil, whose passions were still in agitation, and whose mind could\nnot yet digest the incidents that occurred, embraced them all by turns;\nbut, like the faithful needle, which, though shaken for an instant from\nits poise, immediately regains its true direction, and points\ninvariably to the pole, he soon returned to his Monimia; again he held\nher in his arms, again he drank enchantment from her eyes, and thus\npoured forth the effusions of his soul:—“Can I then trust the evidence\nof sense? And art thou really to my wish restored? Never, O never did\nthy beauty shine with such bewitching grace, as that which now\nconfounds and captivates my view! Sure there is something more than\nmortal in thy looks!—Where hast thou lived?—where borrowed this\nperfection?—whence art thou now descended?—Oh! I am all amazement, joy,\nand fear!—Thou wilt not leave me!—No! we must not part again. By this\nwarm kiss! a thousand times more sweet than all the fragrance of the\nEast! we nevermore will part. O! this is rapture, ecstasy, and what no\nlanguage can explain!”In the midst of these ejaculations, he ravished a banquet from her\nglowing lips, that kindled in his heart a flame which rushed through\nevery vein, and glided to his marrow. This was a privilege he had never\nclaimed before, and now permitted as a recompense for all the penance\nhe had suffered. Nevertheless, the cheeks of Monimia, who was\naltogether unaccustomed to such familiarities, underwent a total\nsuffusion; and Madam Clement discreetly relieved her from the anxiety\nof her situation, by interfering in the discourse, and rallying the\nCount upon his endeavours to monopolise such a branch of happiness."

  "content": "“O my dear lady!” replied Renaldo, who by this time had, in some\nmeasure, recovered his recollection, “forgive the wild transports of a\nfond lover, who hath so unexpectedly retrieved the jewel of his soul!\nYet, far from wishing to hoard up his treasure, he means to communicate\nand diffuse his happiness to all his friends. O my Monimia! how will\nthe pleasure of this hour be propagated! As yet thou knowest not all\nthe bliss that is reserved for thy enjoyment!—Meanwhile, I long to\nlearn by what contrivance this happy interview hath been effected.\nStill am I ignorant how I was transported into this apartment, from the\nlonely vault in which I mourned over my supposed misfortune!”CHAPTER SIXTY-FOURTHE MYSTERY UNFOLDED—ANOTHER RECOGNITION, WHICH, IT IS TO BE HOPED, THE\nREADER COULD NOT FORESEE.The French lady then explained the whole mystery of Monimia’s death, as\na stratagem she had concerted with the clergyman and doctor, in order\nto defeat the pernicious designs of Fathom, who seemed determined to\nsupport his false pretensions by dint of perjury and fraud, which they\nwould have found it very difficult to elude. She observed, that the\nphysician had actually despaired of Monimia’s life, and it was not till\nafter she herself was made acquainted with the prognostic, that she\nwrote the letter to Renaldo, which she committed to the care of Madam\nClement, with an earnest entreaty, that it should not be sent till\nafter her decease. But that lady, believing the Count had been\ncertainly abused by his treacherous confidant, despatched the billet\nwithout the knowledge of Monimia, whose health was restored by the\nindefatigable care of the physician, and the sage exhortations of the\nclergyman, by which she was reconciled to life. In a word, the villany\nof Fathom had inspired her with some faint hope that Renaldo might\nstill be innocent; and that notion contributed not a little to her\ncure.The letter having so effectually answered their warmest hopes, in\nbringing back Renaldo such a pattern of constancy and love, the\nconfederates, in consequence of his enthusiastic sorrow, had planned\nthis meeting, as the most interesting way of restoring two virtuous\nlovers to the arms of each other; for which purpose the good clergyman\nhad pitched upon his own church, and indulged them with the use of the\nvestry, in which they now were presented with a small but elegant\ncollation."

  "content": "Melvil heard this succinct detail with equal joy and admiration. He\npoured forth the dictates of his gratitude to the preservers of his\nhappiness.—“This church,” said he, “shall henceforth possess a double\nshare of my veneration; this holy man will, I hope, finish the\ncharitable work he has begun, by tying those bands of our happiness,\nwhich nought but death shall have power to unbind.” Then turning to\nthat object which was the star of his regard, “Do I not overrate,” said\nhe, “my interest with the fair Monimia?” She made no verbal reply; but\nanswered by an emphatic glance, more eloquent than all the power of\nrhetoric and speech. This language, which is universal in the world of\nlove, he perfectly well understood, and, in token of that faculty,\nsealed the assent which she had smiled, with a kiss imprinted on her\npolished forehead.In order to dissipate these interesting ideas, which, by being too long\nindulged, might have endangered his reason, Madam Clement entreated him\nto entertain the company with a detail of what had happened to him in\nhis last journey to the empire, and Monimia expressed a desire of\nknowing, in particular, the issue of his contest with Count Trebasi,\nwho, she knew, had usurped the succession of his father.Thus solicited, he could not refuse to gratify their curiosity and\nconcern. He explained his obligations to the benevolent Jew; related\nthe steps he had taken at Vienna for the recovery of his inheritance;\ninformed them of his happy rencontre with his father-in-law; of his\nsister’s deliverance, and marriage; of the danger into which his life\nhad been precipitated by the news of Monimia’s death; and, lastly, of\nhis adventure with the banditti, in favour of a gentleman, who, he\nafterwards understood, had been robbed in the most base and barbarous\nmanner by Fathom. He likewise, to the astonishment of all present, and\nof his mistress in particular, communicated some circumstances, which\nshall appear in due season.Monimia’s tender frame being quite fatigued with the scene she had\nacted, and her mind overwhelmed with the prosperous tidings she had\nheard, after having joined the congratulations of the company, on the\ngood fortune of her Renaldo, begged leave to retire, that she might by\nrepose recruit her exhausted spirits; and the night being pretty far\nspent, she was conducted by her lover to Madam Clement’s coach, that\nstood in waiting, in which also the rest of the company made shift to\nembark, and were carried to the house of that good lady, where, after\nthey were invited to dine, and Melvil entreated to bring Don Diego and\nthe Jew along with them, they took leave of one another, and retired to\ntheir respective lodgings in a transport of joy and satisfaction."

While his breast\nunderwent those violent, though blissful emotions of joy and\nadmiration, his friend the Castilian spent the night in ruminating over\nhis own calamities, and in a serious and severe review of his own\nconduct. He compared his own behaviour with that of the young\nHungarian, and found himself so light in the scale, that he smote his\nbreast with violence, exclaiming in an agony of remorse:“Count Melvil has reason to grieve; Don Diego to despair. His\nmisfortunes flow from the villany of mankind; mine are the fruit of my\nown madness. He laments the loss of a mistress, who fell a sacrifice to\nthe perfidious arts of a crafty traitor. She was beautiful, virtuous,\naccomplished, and affectionate; he was fraught with sensibility and\nlove. Doubtless his heart must have deeply suffered; his behaviour\ndenotes the keenness of his woe; his eyes are everflowing fountains of\ntears; his bosom the habitation of sighs; five hundred leagues hath he\nmeasured in a pilgrimage to her tomb; nightly he visits the dreary\nvault where she now lies at rest; her solitary grave is his couch; he\nconverses with darkness and the dead, until each lonely aisle re-echoes\nhis distress. What would be his penance, had he my cause! were he\nconscious of having murdered a beloved wife and darling daughter! Ah\nwretch!—ah cruel homicide!—what had those dear victims done to merit\nsuch a fate? Were they not ever gentle and obedient, ever aiming to\ngive thee satisfaction and delight? Say, that Serafina was enamoured of\na peasant; say, that she had degenerated from the honour of her race.\nThe inclinations are involuntary; perhaps that stranger was her equal\nin pedigree and worth. Had they been fairly questioned, they might have\njustified, at least excused, that conduct which appeared so criminal;\nor had they owned the offence, and supplicated pardon—O barbarous\nmonster that I am! was all the husband—was all the father extinguished\nin my heart? How shall my own errors be forgiven, if I refused to\npardon the frailties of my own blood—of those who are most dear to my\naffection? Yet nature pleaded strongly in their behalf!—My heart was\nbursting while I dismissed them to the shades of death. I was maddened\nwith revenge!

Or is it\nhonourable to poison two defenceless women, a tender wife, an amiable\ndaughter, whom even a frown would almost have destroyed?—O! this is\ncowardice, brutality, hell-born fury and revenge!

Perhaps the saints whom I have murdered will\nintercede for my remission.”Such was the exercise of grief, in which the hapless Castilian consumed\nthe night; he had not yet consigned himself to rest, when Renaldo\nentering his chamber, displayed such a gleam of wildness and rapture on\nhis countenance, as overwhelmed him with amazement; for, till that\nmoment, he had never seen his visage unobscured with woe. “Pardon this\nabrupt intrusion, my friend,” cried Melvil, “I could no longer withhold\nfrom your participation, the great, the unexpected turn, which hath\nthis night dispelled all my sorrows, and restored me to the fruition of\nineffable joy. Monimia lives!—the fair, the tender, the virtuous\nMonimia lives, and smiles upon my vows! This night I retrieved her from\nthe grave. I held her in these arms; I pressed her warm delicious lips\nto mine! Oh, I am giddy with intolerable pleasure!”Don Diego was confounded at this declaration, which he considered as\nthe effects of a disordered brain. He never doubted that Renaldo’s\ngrief had at length overpowered his reason, and that his words were the\neffects of mere frenzy. While he mused on this melancholy subject, the\nCount composed his features, and, in a succinct and well-connected\ndetail, explained the whole mystery of his happiness, to the\ninexpressible astonishment of the Spaniard, who shed tears of\nsatisfaction, and straining the Hungarian to his breast, “O my son,”\nsaid he, “you see what recompense Heaven hath in store for those who\npursue the paths of real virtue; those paths from which I myself have\nbeen fatally misled by a faithless vapour, which hath seduced my steps,\nand left me darkling in the abyss of wretchedness. Such as you describe\nthis happy fair, was once my Serafina, rich in every grace of mind and\nbody which nature could bestow.

I own myself inflamed with a desire of beholding a young lady,\nwhose perfections I have seen reflected in your sorrow; my curiosity\nis, moreover, interested on account of that humane gentlewoman, whose\nuncommon generosity sheltered such virtue in distress; but my\ndisposition is infectious, and will, I am afraid, hang like a damp upon\nthe general festivity of your friends.”Melvil would take no denial, and having obtained his consent, repaired\nto the house of Joshua, whose countenance seemed to unbend gradually\ninto a total expression of joy and surprise, as he learned the\ncircumstances of this amazing event. He faithfully promised to attend\nthe Count at the appointed hour, and, in the meantime, earnestly\nexhorted him to take some repose, in order to quiet the agitation of\nhis spirits, which must have been violently hurried on this occasion.\nThe advice was salutary, and Renaldo resolved to follow it.He returned to his lodgings, and laid himself down; but,\nnotwithstanding the fatigue he had undergone, sleep refused to visit\nhis eyelids, all his faculties being kept in motion by the ideas that\ncrowded so fast upon his imagination. Nevertheless, though his mind\ncontinued in agitation, his body was refreshed, and he arose in the\nforenoon with more serenity and vigour than he had enjoyed for many\nmonths. Every moment his heart throbbed with new rapture, when he found\nhimself on the brink of possessing all that his soul held dear and\namiable; he put on his gayest looks and apparel; insisted upon the\nCastilian’s doing the same honour to the occasion; and the alteration\nof dress produced such an advantageous change in the appearance of Don\nDiego, that when Joshua arrived at the appointed hour, he could scarce\nrecognise his features, and complimented him very politely on the\nimprovement of his looks.True it is, the Spaniard was a personage of a very prepossessing mien\nand noble deportment; and had not grief, by increasing his native\ngravity, in some measure discomposed the symmetry of his countenance,\nhe would have passed for a man of a very amiable and engaging\nphysiognomy. They set out in the Jew’s coach for the house of Madam\nClement, and were ushered into an apartment, where they found the\nclergyman and physician with that lady, to whom Don Diego and the\nHebrew were by Melvil introduced."

He was not\nslow of availing himself of this permission. He disappeared in an\ninstant, and, during his short absence, Don Diego was strangely\ndisturbed The blood flushed and forsook his cheeks by turns; a cold\nvapour seemed to shiver through his nerves; and at his breast he felt\nuncommon palpitation. Madam Clement observed his discomposure, and\nkindly inquired into the cause; when he replied, “I have such an\ninterest in what concerns the Count de Melvil, and my imagination is so\nmuch prepossessed with the perfections of Monimia, that I am, as it\nwere, agonised with expectation; yet never did my curiosity before\nraise such tumults as those that now agitate my bosom.”He had scarce pronounced these words, when the door, reopening, Renaldo\nled in this mirror of elegance and beauty, at sight of whom the\nIsraelite’s countenance was distorted into a stare of admiration. But\nif such was the astonishment of Joshua, what were the emotions of the\nCastilian, when, in the beauteous orphan, he beheld the individual\nfeatures of his long-lost Serafina!His feelings are not to be described. The fond parent, whose affection\nshoots even to a sense of pain, feels not half such transport, when he\nunexpectedly retrieves a darling child from the engulfing billows or\ndevouring flame. The hope of Zelos had been totally extinguished. His\nheart had been incessantly torn with anguish and remorse, upbraiding\nhim as the murderer of Serafina. His, therefore, were the additional\ntransports of a father disburdened of the guilt of such enormous\nhomicide. His nerves were too much overpowered by this sudden\nrecognition, to manifest the sensation of his soul by external signs.\nHe started not, nor did he lift an hand in token of surprise; he moved\nnot from the spot on which he stood; but, riveting his eyes to those of\nthe lovely phantom, remained without motion, until she, approaching\nwith her lover, fell at his feet, and clasping his knees, exclaimed,\n“May I yet call you father?”"

  "content": "This powerful shock aroused his faculties; a cold sweat bedewed his\nforehead; his knees began to totter; he dropped upon the floor, and\nthrowing his arms around her, cried, “O nature! O Serafina! Merciful\nProvidence! thy ways are past finding out.” So saying, he fell upon her\nneck, and wept aloud. The tears of sympathetic joy trickled down her\nsnowy bosom, that heaved with rapture inexpressible. Renaldo’s eyes\npoured forth the briny stream. The cheeks of Madam Clement were not dry\nin this conjuncture; she kneeled by Serafina, kissed her with all the\neagerness of maternal affection, and with uplifted hands adored the\nPower that preordained this blessed event. The clergyman and doctor\nintimately shared the general transport; and as for Joshua, the drops\nof true benevolence flowed from his eyes, like the oil on Aaron’s\nbeard, while he skipped about the room in an awkward ecstasy, and in a\nvoice resembling the hoarse notes of the long-eared tribe, cried, “O\nfather Abraham! such a moving scene hath not been acted since Joseph\ndisclosed himself unto his brethren in Egypt.”Don Diego having found utterance to his passion, proceeded in this\nstrain: “O my dear child! to find thee thus again, after our last\nunhappy parting, is wonderful! miraculous! Blessed be the all-good, my\nconscience. I am not then the dire assassin, who sacrificed his wife\nand daughter to an infernal motive, falsely titled honour? though I am\nmore and more involved in a mystery, which I long to hear explained.”“That shall be my task,” cried Renaldo, “but first permit me to implore\nyour sanction to my passion for the incomparable Serafina. You already\nknow our mutual sentiments; and though I own the possession of such\ninestimable worth and beauty would be a recompense that infinitely\ntranscends the merit I can plead, yet, as it hath been my good fortune\nto inspire her with a mutual flame, I hope to reap from your indulgence\nhere, what I could not expect from my own desert; and we present\nourselves, in hope of your paternal assent and benediction.”“Were she more fair and good and gentle than she is,” answered the\nCastilian, “and to my partial observation nought e’er appeared on earth\nmore beauteous and engaging, I would approve your title to her heart,\nand recommend you to her smiles, with all a father’s influence and\npower. Yes, my daughter! my joy on this occasion is infinitely\naugmented by the knowledge of those tender ties of love that bind thee\nto this amiable youth; a youth to whose uncommon courage and generosity\nI owe my life and my subsistence, together with the inexpressible\ndelight that now revels in my bosom. Enjoy, my children, the happy\nfruits of your reciprocal attachment. May Heaven, which hath graciously\nconducted you through a labyrinth of perplexity and woe, to this\ntransporting view of blissful days, indulge you with that uninterrupted\nstream of pure felicity, which is the hope, and ought to be the boon of\nvirtue, such as yours!”"

The tumult of these emotions having a\nlittle subsided, and the Castilian being seated betwixt Renaldo and his\nbeauteous bride, he politely bespoke the indulgence of Madam Clement,\nbegging she would permit him to demand the performance of the Count’s\npromise, that he might be forthwith made acquainted with those\ncircumstances of his own fate which he was so impatient to learn.The lady having assured him, that she and all the company would take\npleasure in hearing the recapitulation, the Spaniard, addressing\nhimself to Melvil, “In the name of Heaven!” said he, “how could you\nsupplant that rival, who fell a sacrifice to my resentment, after he\nhad bewitched the heart of Serafina? for, sure, the affection he had\nkindled in her breast must have long survived his death,” “That rival,”\nreplied the Count, “who incurred your displeasure, was no other than\nRenaldo.” With these words, he applied to one eye a patch of black silk\nprovided for the purpose, and turning his face towards Don Diego, that\ngentleman started with astonishment, crying, “Good Heaven! the very\ncountenance of Orlando, whom I slew! this is still more amazing!”CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVEA RETROSPECTIVE LINK, NECESSARY FOR THE CONCATENATION OF THESE MEMOIRS."

  "content": "“Indulge me with a patient hearing,” proceeded the Hungarian, “and all\nthese riddles soon will be explained. Inflamed with the desire of\nseeing foreign countries, I disobeyed the will of an indulgent father,\nfrom whose house, withdrawing privately, I set out for Italy, in\ndisguise, by the way of Tyrol, visited Venice, Rome, Florence, and,\nembarking at Naples, in an English ship, arrived at St. Lucar, from\nwhence I repaired to Seville; there, in a few days, was my curiosity\nengaged by the fame of the fair Serafina, who was justly deemed the\nmost accomplished beauty in that part of Spain. Nay, blush not, gentle\ncreature! for by my hopes of heaven! thy charms were even injured by\nthe cold applause of that report. Nevertheless, I was warmly interested\nby the uncommon character, and eagerly longed to see this pattern of\nperfection. As Don Diego did not train her up in that restraint to\nwhich the Spanish ladies are subjected, I soon found an opportunity of\nseeing her at church; and no person here present will, I presume, doubt\nbut that I was instantly captivated by her beauty and deportment. Had I\nthought that Don Diego’s favour was unengaged, perhaps I should have\nfollowed the dictates of vanity and inexperience, and presented myself\nin my own character, among the crowd of her professed admirers. I knew\nher father had been an officer of distinguished rank and reputation,\nand did not doubt that he would have regarded a young soldier of\nunexceptionable pedigree, and, I will even add, of untainted fame. Nor\ndid I suppose my own father could have objected against such an\nadvantageous match; but, by dint of industrious inquiry, I learned,\nthat the divine Serafina was already betrothed to Don Manuel de\nMendoza, and this information overwhelmed me with despair.“After having revolved a thousand projects for retarding and preventing\nthat detested union, I resolved to avail myself of my talent for\ndrawing, and professed myself a master of that science, in hope of\nbeing employed by the father of Serafina, who, I knew, let slip no\nopportunity of improving his daughter’s education. Accordingly I had\nthe good fortune to attract his notice, was invited to his house,\nhonoured with his approbation, and furnished with unrestricted\nopportunities of conversing with the dear object of my love. The\npassion which her beauty had kindled was by the perfections of her mind\ninflamed to such a degree of transport, as could not be concealed from\nher penetration. She chanced to relish my conversation; I gradually\nacquired her friendship; pity was the next passion that she entertained\nin my favour. I then ventured to disclose myself, and the dear charmer\ndid not disapprove of my presumption. She and her mother had been\nperplexed with some religious scruples, concerning which they appealed\nto my opinion; and I was happy enough to set their minds at ease.“This sort of intercourse naturally created a mutual confidence among\nus; and, in a word, I was blessed with the daughter’s love and mother’s\napprobation. Don Diego will pardon these clandestine measures, which we\ntook, from a full persuasion that it was impossible to render him\npropitious to the views in which our hearts and hands were so deeply\ninterested. I did not then know how little he was addicted to\nsuperstition."

When the hour of appointment arrived, I repaired to the place\nat which I had proposed to enter the house, and stumbled, in the dark,\nover the body of a man still warm, and bleeding. Alarmed at this\noccurrence, I darted myself through the window, and rushing to the\napartment of the ladies, (immortal powers!) beheld the peerless\nSerafina, and her virtuous mother, stretched on a couch, and, in all\nappearance, deprived of life.“The company will easily conceive what agonies I felt at such a\nspectacle! I ran towards the spot in a transport of horror! I clasped\nmy lovely mistress in my arms, and, finding her still breathing,\nendeavoured, but in vain, to wake her from the trance Antonia was\noverwhelmed with the same lethargic power. My fancy was immediately\nstruck with the apprehension of their being poisoned. Regardless of my\nown situation, I alarmed the family, called for assistance, and\nrequested the servants to summon Don Diego to the dismal scene. I was\ninformed that their master had rode forth in manifest confusion; and\nwhile I pondered on this surprising excursion, an apothecary in the\nneighbourhood entered the chamber, and having examined the pulses of\nthe ladies, declared that their lives were in no danger, and advised\nthat they should be undressed, and conveyed to bed. While their women\nwere busied in this employment, I went into the court-yard, attended by\nsome of the servants with lights, in order to view the body of the man\nwhich I had found at my arrival. His apparel was mean, his countenance\nferocious; a long spado was buckled to his thigh, and, in his belt,\nwere stuck a brace of loaded pistols; so that we concluded he was some\nthief, who had waited for an opportunity, and seeing the casement open,\nintended to rob the house, but was prevented, and slain by Don Diego\nhimself, whose retreat, however, did not a little confound our\nconjecture. For my own part, I remained all night in the house,\ntortured with fear, vexation, and suspense."

The major-domo having waited several\nhours for his lord’s return, without seeing him appear, thought proper\nto despatch a messenger to Don Manuel, with an account of what had\nhappened; and that nobleman arriving in the morning, took possession of\nthe house. About four o’clock in the afternoon, Serafina began to stir,\nand, at five, she and her mother were perfectly awake.“They no sooner recovered the use of reflection, than they gave signs\nof equal sorrow and amazement, and earnestly called for Isabella, who\nwas privy to our design, and who, after a very minute inquiry, was\nfound in a lone and solitary chamber, where she had been confined. Such\nwas the confusion of the house, that no person ever dreamed of asking\nhow I entered, each domestic, in all probability, supposing I had been\nintroduced by his fellow; so that I tarried unquestioned, on pretence\nof concern for the distress of a family in which I had been so\ngenerously entertained, and, by Isabella, sent my respects and duty to\nher ladies. She was, therefore, not a little surprised, when, after\nevery other servant had withdrawn, she heard the lovely Serafina\nexclaim, with all the violence of grief, ‘Ah! Isabella, Orlando is no\nmore!’ But their astonishment was still greater, when she assured them\nof my being alive, and in the house. They recounted to her the\nadventure of last night, which she explained, by informing them of the\nletters which Don Diego had intercepted. And they immediately\nconcluded, that he had, in the precipitation of his wrath, killed, by\nmistake, the person who was found dead in the court-yard. This\nconjecture alarmed them on my account; they, by the medium of Isabella,\nconjured me to leave the house, lest Don Diego should return, and\naccomplish his resentment; and I was persuaded to withdraw, after I had\nsettled the channel of a correspondence with the confidant."
