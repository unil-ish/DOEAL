He\ntherefore suggested another expedient in lieu of the sulphur, namely,\nthe gum called assafatida, which, though abundantly nauseous, could\nhave no effect upon the infirm texture of the lieutenant’s lungs. This\nhint being relished by the major, our adventurer returned to his\nprincipal, and having repeated the other’s arguments against the use of\nmortal instruments, described the succedaneum which he had concerted\nwith Macleaver. The captain at first believed the scheme was calculated\nfor subjecting him to the ridicule of his fellow-prisoners, and began\nto storm with great violence; but, by the assurances and address of\nFathom, he was at length reconciled to the plan, and preparations were\nmade on each side for this duel, which was actually smoked next day,\nabout noon, in a small closet, detached from the challenger’s\napartment, and within hearing of his majesty, and all his court,\nassembled as witnesses and umpires of the contest.The combatants, being locked up together, began to ply their engines\nwith great fury, and it was not long before Captain Minikin perceived\nhe had a manifest advantage over his antagonist. For his organs were\nfamiliarised to the effluvia of this drug, which he had frequently used\nin the course of an hypochondriac disorder; whereas Macleaver, who was\na stranger to all sorts of medicine, by his wry faces and attempts to\npuke, expressed the utmost abhorrence of the smell that invaded his\nnostrils. Nevertheless, resolved to hold out to the last extremity, he\ncontinued in action until the closet was filled with such an\nintolerable vapour as discomposed the whole economy of his entrails,\nand compelled him to disgorge his breakfast in the face of his\nopponent, whose nerves were so disconcerted by this disagreeable and\nunforeseen discharge, that he fell back into his chair in a swoon, and\nthe major bellowed aloud for assistance. The door being opened, he ran\ndirectly to the window, to inhale the fresh air, while the captain,\nrecovering from his fit, complained of Macleaver’s unfair proceeding,\nand demanded justice of the arbitrators, who decided in his favour; and\nthe major being prevailed upon to ask pardon for having introduced Mrs.\nMinikin to women of rotten reputation, the parties were reconciled to\neach other, and peace and concord re-established in the mess.Fathom acquired universal applause for his discreet and humane conduct\nupon this occasion; and that same afternoon had an opportunity of\nseeing the lady in whose cause he had exerted himself. He was presented\nto her as the husband’s particular friend, and when she understood how\nmuch she was indebted to his care and concern for the captain’s safety,\nshe treated him with uncommon marks of distinction; and he found her a\ngenteel, well-bred woman, not without a good deal of personal charms,\nand a well-cultivated understanding.CHAPTER FORTY-TWO"

What were the emotions of\nhis soul, when he saw that young gentleman enter the prison, and\nadvance towards him, after having spoke to the jailor! He never doubted\nthat, being informed of his confinement, he was come to upbraid him\nwith his villany and ingratitude, and he in vain endeavoured to\nrecollect himself from that terror and guilty confusion which his\nappearance had inspired; when the stranger, lifting up his eyes,\nstarted back with signs of extreme amazement, and, after a considerable\npause, exclaimed, “Heaven and earth! Sure my eyes do not deceive me! is\nnot your name Fathom? It is, it must be my old friend and companion,\nthe loss of whom I have so long regretted!” With these words he ran\ntowards our adventurer, and, while he clasped him in his arms with all\nthe eagerness of affection, protested that this was one of the happiest\ndays he had ever seen."

  "content": "Ferdinand, who, from this salutation, concluded himself still in\npossession of Renaldo’s good opinion, was not deficient in expressions\nof tenderness and joy; he returned his embraces with equal ardour, the\ntears trickled down his cheeks, and that perturbation which proceeded\nfrom conscious perfidy and fear, was mistaken by the unsuspecting\nHungarian for the sheer effects of love, gratitude, and surprise. These\nfirst transports having subsided, they adjourned to the lodgings of\nFathom, who soon recollected his spirits and invention so well as to\namuse the other with a feigned tale of his having been taken by the\nFrench, sent prisoner into Champagne, from whence he had written many\nletters to Count Melvil and his son, of whom he could hear no tidings;\nof his having contracted an intimacy with a young nobleman of France,\nwho died in the flower of his age, after having, in token of his\nfriendship, bequeathed to him a considerable legacy; by this he had\nbeen enabled to visit the land of his forefathers in the character of a\ngentleman, which he had supported with some figure, until he was\nbetrayed into a misfortune that exhausted his funds, and drove him to\nthe spot where he was now found. And he solemnly declared, that, far\nfrom forgetting the obligation he owed to Count Melvil, or renouncing\nthe friendship of Renaldo, he had actually resolved to set out for\nGermany on his return to the house of his patron in the beginning of\nthe week posterior to that in which he had been arrested.Young Melvil, whose own heart had never known the instigations of\nfraud, implicitly believed the story and protestations of Fathom; and\nthough he would not justify that part of his conduct by which the term\nof his good fortune was abridged, he could not help excusing an\nindiscretion into which he had been hurried by the precipitancy of\nyouth, and the allurements of an artful woman. Nay, with the utmost\nwarmth of friendship, he undertook to wait upon Trapwell, and endeavour\nto soften him into some reasonable terms of composition.Fathom seemed to be quite overwhelmed with a deep sense of all this\ngoodness, and affected the most eager impatience to know the\nparticulars of Renaldo’s fate, since their unhappy separation, more\nespecially his errand to this uncomfortable place, which he should\nhenceforth revere as the providential scene of their reunion. Nor did\nhe forget to inquire, in the most affectionate and dutiful manner,\nabout the situation of his noble parents and amiable sister."

  "content": "At mention of these names, Renaldo, fetching a deep sigh, “Alas! my\nfriend,” said he, “the Count is no more; and, what aggravates my\naffliction for the loss of such a father, it was my misfortune to be\nunder his displeasure at the time of his death. Had I been present on\nthat melancholy occasion, so well I knew his generosity and paternal\ntenderness, that, sure I am, he would in his last moments have forgiven\nan only son, whose life had been a continual effort to render himself\nworthy of such a parent, and whose crime was no other than an\nhonourable passion for the most meritorious of her sex. But I was\nremoved at a fatal distance from him, and doubtless my conduct must\nhave been invidiously misrepresented. Be that as it will, my mother has\nagain given her hand in wedlock to Count Trebasi; by whom I have the\nmortification to be informed that I am totally excluded from my\nfather’s succession; and I learn from other quarters, that my sister is\nbarbarously treated by this inhuman father-in-law. Grant, Heaven, I may\nsoon have an opportunity of expostulating with the tyrant upon that\nsubject.”So saying, his cheeks glowed, and his eyes lightened with resentment.\nThen he thus proceeded: “My coming hither to-day was with a view to\nvisit a poor female relation, from whom I yesterday received a letter,\ndescribing her most deplorable situation, and soliciting my assistance;\nbut the turnkey affirms that there is no such person in the jail, and I\nwas on my way to consult the keeper, when I was agreeably surprised\nwith the sight of my dear Fathom.”Our adventurer having wiped from his eyes the tears which were produced\nby the news of his worthy patron’s death, desired to know the name of\nthat afflicted prisoner, in whose behalf he interested himself so much,\nand Renaldo produced the letter, subscribed, “Your unfortunate cousin,\nHelen Melvil.” This pretended relation, after having explained the\ndegree of consanguinity which she and the Count stood in to each other,\nand occasionally mentioned some anecdotes of the family in Scotland,\ngave him to understand that she had married a merchant of London, who,\nby repeated losses in trade, had been reduced to indigence, and\nafterwards confined to prison, where he then lay a breathless corpse,\nhaving left her in the utmost extremity of wretchedness and want, with\ntwo young children in the smallpox, and an incurable cancer in one of\nher own breasts. Indeed, the picture she drew was so moving, and her\nexpressions so sensibly pathetic, that no person, whose heart was not\naltogether callous, could peruse it without emotion. Renaldo had sent\ntwo guineas by the messenger, whom she had represented as a trusty\nservant, whose fidelity had been proof against all the distress of her\nmistress; and he was now arrived in order to reinforce his bounty."

  "content": "Fathom, in the consciousness of his own practices, immediately\ncomprehended the scheme of this letter, and confidently assured him\nthat no such person resided in the prison or in any other place. And\nwhen his friend applied for information to the keeper, these assurances\nwere confirmed; and that stern janitor told him he had been imposed\nupon by a stale trick, which was often practised upon strangers by a\nset of sharpers, who make it their business to pick up hints of\nintelligence relating to private families, upon which they build such\nsuperstructures of fraud and imposition.However piqued the young Hungarian might be to find himself duped in\nthis manner, he rejoiced at the occasion which had thrown Fathom in his\nway; and, after having made him a tender of his purse, took his leave,\non purpose to wait upon Trapwell, who was not quite so untractable as\nan enraged cuckold commonly is; for, by this time, he had accomplished\nthe best part of his aim, which was to be divorced from his wife, and\nwas fully convinced that the defendant was no more than a needy\nadventurer, who, in all probability, would be released by an act of\nparliament for the benefit of insolvent debtors; in which case, he, the\nplaintiff, would reap no solid advantage from his imprisonment.He, therefore, listened to the remonstrances of the mediator, and,\nafter much canvassing, agreed to discharge the defendant, in\nconsideration of two hundred pounds, which were immediately paid by\nCount Melvil, who, by this deduction, was reduced to somewhat less than\nthirty.Nevertheless, he cheerfully beggared himself in behalf of his friend,\nfor whose release he forthwith obtained an order; and, next day, our\nadventurer, having bid a formal adieu to his fellows in distress, and,\nin particular, to his majesty, for whose restoration his prayers were\npreferred, he quitted the jail, and accompanied his deliverer, with all\nthe outward marks of unutterable gratitude and esteem.Surely, if his heart had been made of penetrable stuff, it would have\nbeen touched by the circumstances of this redemption; but had not his\nsoul been invincible to all such attacks, these memoirs would possibly\nnever have seen the light."

  "content": "When they arrived at Renaldo’s lodgings, that young gentleman honoured\nhim with other proofs of confidence and friendship, by giving him a\ncircumstantial detail of all the adventures in which he had been\nengaged after Fathom’s desertion from the imperial camp. He told him,\nthat, immediately after the war was finished, his father had pressed\nhim to a very advantageous match, with which he would have complied,\nthough his heart was not at all concerned, had not he been inflamed\nwith the desire of seeing the world before he could take any step\ntowards a settlement for life. That he had signified his sentiments on\nthis head to the Count, who opposed them with unusual obstinacy, as\nproductive of a delay which might be fatal to his proposal; for which\nreason he had retired incognito from his family, and travelled through\nsundry states and countries, in a disguise by which he eluded the\ninquiries of his parents.That, in the course of these peregrinations, he was captivated by the\nirresistible charms of a young lady, on whose heart he had the good\nfortune to make a tender impression. That their mutual love had\nsubjected both to many dangers and difficulties, during which they\nsuffered a cruel separation; after the torments of which, he had\nhappily found her in England, where she now lived entirely cut off from\nher native country and connexions, and destitute of every other\nresource but his honour, love, and protection. And, finally, that he\nwas determined to combat his own desires, how violent soever they might\nbe, until he should have made some suitable provision for the\nconsequences of a stricter union with the mistress of his soul, that he\nmight not, by a precipitate marriage, ruin the person whom he adored.This end he proposed to attain, by an application to the court of\nVienna, which he did not doubt would have some regard to his own\nservice, and that of his father; and thither he resolved to repair,\nwith the first opportunity, now that he had found a friend with whom he\ncould intrust the inestimable jewel of his heart.He likewise gave our hero to understand, that he had been eight months\nin England, during which he had lived in a frugal manner, that he might\nnot unnecessarily exhaust the money he had been able to raise upon his\nown credit; that, hitherto, he had been obliged to defer his departure\nfor Germany on account of his attendance upon the mother of his\nmistress, who was lately dead of sorrow and chagrin; and that, since he\nresided in London, he had often heard of the celebrated Count Fathom,\nthough he never imagined that his friend Ferdinand could be\ndistinguished by that appellation.CHAPTER FORTY-THREEFATHOM JUSTIFIES THE PROVERB, “WHAT’S BRED IN THE BONE WILL NEVER COME\nOUT OF THE FLESH.”"

  "content": "Some circumstances of this conversation made a deep impression upon the\nmind of our adventurer, who nevertheless concealed his emotions from\nthe knowledge of his friend, and was next day introduced to that hidden\ntreasure of which Renaldo had spoken with such rapture and adoration.\nIt was not without reason he had expatiated upon the personal\nattractions of this young lady, whom, for the present, we shall call\nMonimia, a name that implies her orphan situation. When she entered the\nroom, even Fathom, whose eyes had been sated with beauty, was struck\ndumb with admiration, and could scarce recollect himself so far as to\nperform the ceremony of his introduction.She seemed to be about the age of eighteen. Her stature was tall; her\nmotion graceful. A knot of artificial flowers restrained the luxuriancy\nof her fine black hair, that flowed in shining ringlets adown her snowy\nneck. The contour of her face was oval; her forehead remarkably high;\nher complexion clean and delicate, though not florid; and her eyes were\nso piercing, as to strike the soul of every beholder. Yet, upon this\noccasion, one half of their vivacity was eclipsed by a languishing air\nof melancholy concern; which, while it in a manner sheathed the edge of\nher beauty, added a most engaging sweetness to her looks. In short,\nevery feature was elegantly perfect; and the harmony of the whole\nravishing and delightful.It was easy to perceive the mutual sentiments of the two lovers at\nmeeting, by the pleasure that sensibly diffused itself in the\ncountenances of both. Fathom was received by her as the intimate friend\nof her admirer, whom she had often heard of in terms of the most\nsincere affection; and the conversation was carried on in the Italian\nlanguage, because she was a foreigner who had not as yet made great\nproficiency in the knowledge of the English tongue. Her understanding\nwas such as, instead of diminishing, reinforced the prepossession which\nwas inspired by her appearance; and if the sum-total of her charms\ncould not melt the heart, it at least excited the appetite of Fathom to\nsuch a degree, that he gazed upon her with such violence of desire, as\nhad never transported him before; and he instantly began to harbour\nthoughts, not only destructive to the peace of his generous patron, but\nalso to the prudential maxims he had adopted on his first entrance into\nlife."

  "content": "We have already recorded divers instances of his conduct to prove that\nthere was an intemperance in his blood, which often interfered with his\ncaution; and although he had found means to render this heat sometimes\nsubservient to his interest, yet, in all probability, Heaven mingled\nthe ingredient in his constitution, on purpose to counteract his\nconsummate craft, defeat the villany of his intention, and at least\nexpose him to the justice of the law, and the contempt of his\nfellow-creatures.Stimulated as he was by the beauty of the incomparable Monimia, he\nforesaw that the conquest of her heart would cost him a thousand times\nmore labour and address than all the victories he had ever achieved;\nfor, besides her superior understanding, her sentiments of honour,\nvirtue, gratitude, religion, and pride of birth, her heart was already\nengaged by the tenderest ties of love and obligation, to a man whose\nperson and acquired accomplishments at least equalled his own; and\nwhose connexion with him was of such a nature as raised an almost\ninsurmountable bar to his design; because, with what face could he\ncommence rival to the person whose family had raised him from want and\nservility, and whose own generosity had rescued him from the miseries\nof a dreary gaol?Notwithstanding these reflections, he would not lay aside an idea which\nso agreeably flattered his imagination. He, like every other projector\nin the same circumstances, was so partial to his own qualifications, as\nto think the lady would soon perceive a difference between him and\nRenaldo that could not fail to turn to his advantage in her opinion. He\ndepended a good deal on the levity and inconstancy of the sex; and did\nnot doubt that, in the course of their acquaintance, he should profit\nby that languor which often creeps upon and flattens the intercourse of\nlovers cloyed with the sight and conversation of each other."

  "content": "This way of arguing was very natural to a man who had never known other\nmotives than those of sensuality and convenience; and perhaps, upon\nthese maxims, he might have succeeded with nine-tenths of the fair sex.\nBut, for once, he erred in his calculation; Monimia’s soul was perfect,\nher virtue impregnable. His first approaches were, as usual, performed\nby the method of insinuation, which succeeded so well, that in a few\ndays he actually acquired a very distinguished share of her favour and\nesteem. To this he had been recommended, in the warmest strain of\nexaggerating friendship, by her dear Renaldo; so that, placing the most\nunreserved confidence in his honour and integrity, and being almost\nquite destitute of acquaintance, she made no scruple of owning herself\npleased with his company and conversation; and therefore he was never\nabridged in point of opportunity. She had too much discernment to\noverlook his uncommon talents and agreeable address, and too much\nsusceptibility to observe them with indifference. She not only regarded\nhim as the confidant of her lover, but admired him as a person whose\nattachment did honour to Count Melvil’s choice. She found his discourse\nremarkably entertaining, his politeness dignified with an air of\nuncommon sincerity, and she was ravished with his skill in music, an\nart of which she was deeply enamoured.While he thus ingratiated himself with the fair Monimia, Renaldo\nrejoiced at their intimacy, being extremely happy in the thought of\nhaving found a friend who could amuse and protect the dear creature in\nhis absence. That she might be the better prepared for the temporary\nseparation which he meditated, he began to be less frequent in his\nvisits, or rather to interrupt, by gradual intermissions, the constant\nattendance he had bestowed upon her since her mother’s death. This\nalteration she was enabled to bear by the assiduities of Fathom, when\nshe understood that her lover was indispensably employed in negotiating\na sum of money for the purposes of his intended voyage. This was really\nthe case; for, as the reader hath been already informed, the provision\nhe had made for that emergency was expended in behalf of our\nadventurer; and the persons of whom he had borrowed it, far from\napproving of the use to which it was put, and accommodating him with a\nfresh supply, reproached him with his benevolence as an act of\ndishonesty to them; and, instead of favouring this second application,\nthreatened to distress him for what he had already received. While he\nendeavoured to surmount these difficulties, his small reversion was\nquite exhausted, and he saw himself on the brink of wanting the common\nnecessaries of life.There was no difficulty which he could not have encountered with\nfortitude, had he alone been concerned. But his affection and regard\nfor Monimia were of such a delicate nature, that, far from being able\nto bear the prospect of her wanting the least convenience, he could not\nendure that she should suspect her situation cost him a moment’s\nperplexity; because he foresaw it would wring her gentle heart with\nunspeakable anguish and vexation. This, therefore, he endeavoured to\nanticipate by expressions of confidence in the Emperor’s equity, and\nfrequent declarations touching the goodness and security of that credit\nfrom which he derived his present subsistence."

Every day ushered in new demands and\nfresh anxiety; for though his economy was frugal, it could not be\nsupported without money; and now not only his funds were drained, but\nalso his private friends tired of relieving his domestic necessities;\nnay, they began to relinquish his company, which formerly they had\ncoveted; and those who still favoured him with their company embittered\nthat favour with disagreeable advice, mingled with impertinent reproof.\nThey loudly exclaimed against the last instance of his friendship for\nFathom, as a piece of wrong-headed extravagance, which neither his\nfortune could afford nor his conscience excuse; and alleged that such\nspecimens of generosity are vicious in any man, let his finances be\nnever so opulent, if he has any relations of his own who need his\nassistance; but altogether scandalous, not to say unjust, in a person\nwho depends for his own support on the favour of his friends.These expostulations did not even respect the beauteous, the\naccomplished, the gentle-hearted, the orphan Monimia. Although they\nowned her perfections, and did not deny that it would be highly\nmeritorious in any man of fortune to make her happy, they disapproved\nof Renaldo’s attachment to the fair beggar, made light of that intimate\nunion of hearts which subsisted between the two lovers, and which no\nhuman consideration could dissolve; and some among them, in the\nconsummation of their prudence, ventured to hint a proposal of\nproviding for her in the service of some lady of fashion."

  "content": "Any reader of sensibility will easily conceive how these admonitions\nwere relished by a young gentleman whose pride was indomitable, whose\nnotions of honour were scrupulously rigid and romantic, whose temper\nwas warm, and whose love was intense. Every such suggestion was as a\ndagger to his soul; and what rendered the torture more exquisite, he\nlay under obligations to those very persons whose selfish and sordid\nsentiments he disdained; so that he was restricted by gratitude from\ngiving vent to his indignation, and his forlorn circumstances would not\npermit him to renounce their acquaintance. While he struggled with\nthese mortifications, his wants grew more and more importunate, and his\ncreditors became clamorous.Fathom, to whom all his grievances were disclosed, lamented his hard\nhap with all the demonstrations of sympathy which he could expect to\nfind in such a zealous adherent. He upbraided himself incessantly as\nthe cause of his patron’s distress; took God to witness that he would\nrather have perished in gaol than have enjoyed his liberty, had he\nknown it would have cost his dearest friend and benefactor one-tenth\npart of the anguish he now saw him suffer; and, in conclusion, the\nfervency of his affection glowed to such a degree, that he offered to\nbeg, steal, or plunder on the highway, for Renaldo’s assistance.Certain it is, he might have recollected a less disagreeable expedient\nthan any of these to alleviate the pangs of this unhappy lover; for, at\nthat very period he was possessed of money and moveables to the amount\nof a much greater sum than that which was necessary to remove the\nseverest pangs of the Count’s misfortune. But, whether he did not\nreflect upon this resource, or was willing to let Melvil be better\nacquainted with adversity, which is the great school of life, I shall\nleave the reader to determine. Yet, so far was he from supplying the\nwants of the young Hungarian, that he did not scruple to receive a\nshare of the miserable pittance which that gentleman made shift to\nextort from the complaisance of a few companions, whose countenance he\nstill enjoyed."

Almost his whole time was engrossed by a double scheme,\ncomprehending his efforts to render his departure practicable, and his\nexpedients for raising the means of daily bread. With regard to the\nfirst, he exerted himself among a set of merchants, some of whom knew\nhis family and expectations; and, for the last, he was fain to depend\nupon the assistance of a few intimates, who were not in a condition to\nfurnish him with sums of consequence. These, however, gradually dropped\noff, on pretence of friendly resentment for his indiscreet conduct; so\nthat he found himself naked and deserted by all his former companions,\nexcept one gentleman, with whom he had lived in the most unreserved\ncorrespondence, as with a person of the warmest friendship, and the\nmost unbounded benevolence; nay, he had actually experienced repeated\nproofs of his generosity; and such were the Count’s sentiments of the\ngratitude, love, and esteem, which were due to the author of these\nobligations, that he would have willingly laid down his own life for\nhis interest or advantage. He had already been at different times\naccommodated by this benefactor with occasional supplies, amounting in\nthe whole to about forty or fifty pounds; and so fearful was he of\ntaking any step by which he might forfeit the goodwill of this\ngentleman, that he struggled with unparelleled difficulty and vexation,\nbefore he could prevail upon himself to put his liberality to another\nproof.What maxims of delicacy will not the dire calls of necessity infringe!\nReduced to the alternative of applying once more to that beneficence\nwhich had never failed him, or of seeing Monimia starve, he chose the\nfirst, as of two evils the least, and intrusted Fathom with a letter\nexplaining the bitterness of his case.

The\ngentleman, after having professed himself Melvil’s sincere well-wisher,\ngave him to understand, that he was resolved for the future to detach\nhimself from every correspondence which would be inconvenient for him\nto maintain; that he considered his intimacy with the Count in that\nlight; yet, nevertheless, if his distress was really as great as he had\ndescribed it, he would still contribute something towards his relief;\nand accordingly had sent by the bearer five guineas for that purpose;\nbut desired him to take notice, that, in so doing, he laid himself\nunder some difficulty."

Though his\npurse was exhausted to the last shilling; though he was surrounded with\nnecessities and demands, and knew not how to provide another meal for\nhis fair dependent, he, in opposition to all the suggestions and\neloquence of Fathom, despatched him with the money and another billet,\nintimating, in the most respectful terms, that he approved of his\nfriend’s new-adopted maxim, which, for the future, he should always\ntake care to remember; and that he had sent back the last instance of\nhis bounty, as a proof how little he was disposed to incommode his\nbenefactor.This letter, though sincerely meant, and written in a very serious\nmood, the gentleman considered as an ungrateful piece of irony, and in\nthat opinion complained to several persons of the Count’s acquaintance,\nwho unanimously exclaimed against him as a sordid, unthankful, and\nprofligate knave, that abused and reviled those very people who had\ngenerously befriended him, whenever they found it inconvenient to\nnourish his extravagance with further supplies. Notwithstanding these\naccumulated oppressions, he still persevered with fortitude in his\nendeavours to disentangle himself from this maze of misery. To these he\nwas encouraged by a letter which about this time he received from his\nsister, importing, that she had good reason to believe the real will of\nher father had been suppressed for certain sinister views; and desiring\nhim to hasten his departure for Hungary, where he would still find some\nfriends who were both able and willing to support his cause. He had\nsome trinkets left; the pawnbroker’s shop was still open; and hitherto\nhe made shift to conceal from Monimia the extent of his affliction.The money-broker whom he employed, after having amused him with a\nvariety of schemes, which served no other purpose than that of\nprotracting his own job, at length undertook to make him acquainted\nwith a set of monied men who had been very venturous in lending sums\nupon personal security; he was therefore introduced to their club in\nthe most favourable manner, after the broker had endeavoured to\nprepossess them separately, with magnificent ideas of his family and\nfortune.—By means of this anticipation he was received with a manifest\nrelaxation of that severity which people of this class mingle in their\naspects to the world in general; and they even vied with each other in\ntheir demonstrations of hospitality and respect; for every one in\nparticular looked upon him as a young heir, who would bleed freely, and\nmortgage at cent. per cent."

The person accused alleged, in his own defence, that the\nborrower was his own kinsman, whose funds he knew to be sufficient;\nthat he had granted his bond, and been at the expense of insuring his\nlife for the money; and, in conclusion, had discharged it to the day\nwith great punctuality. These allegations were not deemed exculpatory\nby the rest of the assembly, who with one voice pronounced him guilty\nof unwarrantable rashness and indiscretion, which, in time coming, must\nundoubtedly operate to the prejudice of his character and credit.This was a bitter declaration to the young Count, who nevertheless\nendeavoured to improve the footing he had gained among them, by\ncourting their company, conforming to their manners, and attentively\nlistening to their discourse. When he had cultivated them with great\nassiduity for the space of some weeks, dined at their houses upon\npressing invitations, and received repeated offers of service and\nfriendship, believing that things were now ripe for the purpose, he,\none day, at a tavern to which he had invited him to dinner, ventured to\ndisclose his situation to him whose countenance was the least\nunpromising; and as he introduced the business with a proposal of\nborrowing money, he perceived his eyes sparkle with a visible alacrity,\nfrom which he drew a happy presage. But, alas! this was no more than a\ntransient gleam of sunshine, which was suddenly obumbrated by the\nsequel of his explanation; insomuch, that, when the merchant understood\nthe nature of the security, his visage was involved in a most\ndisagreeable gloom, and his eyes distorted into a most hideous\nobliquity of vision; indeed, he squinted so horribly, that Renaldo was\namazed and almost affrighted at his looks, until he perceived that this\ndistortion proceeded from concern for a silver tobacco box which he had\nlaid down by him on the table, after having filled his pipe. As the\nyouth proceeded to unfold his necessities, the other became gradually\nalarmed for this utensil, to which he darted his eyes askance in this\npreternatural direction, until he had slyly secured it in his pocket."

My correspondents abroad have remitted such a number of bad\nbills of late, that all my running cash hath been exhausted in\nsupporting their credit. Mr. Ferret, sure I am, you was not ignorant of\nmy situation; and I’m not a little surprised that you should bring the\ngentleman to me on business of this kind; but, as the wise man\nobserves, Bray a fool in a mortar, and he’ll never be wise.” So saying,\nwith a most emphatic glance directed to the broker, he rung the bell,\nand called for the reckoning; when, finding that he was to be the guest\nof Renaldo, he thanked him drily for his good cheer, and in an abrupt\nmanner took himself away.Though baffled in this quarter, the young gentleman would not despair;\nbut forthwith employed Mr. Ferret in an application to another of the\nsociety; who, after having heard the terms of his commission, desired\nhim to tell his principal, that he could do nothing without the\nconcurrence of his partner, who happened to be at that time in one of\nour American plantations. A third being solicited, excused himself on\naccount of an oath which he had lately taken on the back of a\nconsiderable loss. A fourth being tried, made answer, that it was not\nin his way. And a fifth candidly owned, that he never lent money\nwithout proper security."

Well-nigh destitute of\npresent support, and encompassed with unrelenting duns, he was obliged\nto keep within doors, and seek some comfort in the conversation of his\ncharming mistress, and his faithful friend; yet, even there, he\nexperienced the extremest rigour of adverse fate. Every rap at the door\nalarmed him with the expectation of some noisy tradesman demanding\npayment. When he endeavoured to amuse himself with drawing, some\nunlucky feature of the occasional portrait recalled the image of an\nobdurate creditor, and made him tremble at the work of his own hands.\nWhen he fled for shelter to the flattering creation of fancy, some\nabhorred idea always started up amidst the gay vision, and dissolved\nthe pleasing enchantment.—Even the seraphic voice of Monimia had no\nlonger power to compose the anxious tumults of his mind. Every song she\nwarbled, every tune she played, recalled to his remembrance some scene\nof love and happiness elapsed; and overwhelmed his soul with the woful\ncomparison of past and present fate. He saw all that was amiable and\nperfect in woman, all that he held most dear and sacred upon earth,\ntottering on the brink of misery, without knowing the danger of her\nsituation, and found himself unable to prevent her fall, or even to\nforewarn her of the peril; for as we have already observed, his soul\ncould not brook the thought of communicating the tidings of distress to\nthe tender-hearted Monimia.CHAPTER FORTY-FIVERENALDO’S DISTRESS DEEPENS, AND FATHOM’S PLOT THICKENS.Such aggravated misfortune could not fail to affect his temper and\ndeportment. The continual efforts he made to conceal his vexation\nproduced a manifest distraction in his behaviour and discourse. He\nbegan to be seized with horror at the sight of poor Monimia, whom he\ntherefore shunned as much as the circumstances of their correspondence\nwould allow; and every evening he went forth alone to some solitary\nplace, where he could, unperceived, give a loose to the transports of\nhis sorrow, and in silence meditate some means to lighten the burden of\nhis woe. His heart was sometimes so savaged with despair, which\nrepresented mankind as his inveterate enemies, that he entertained\nthoughts of denouncing war against the whole community, and supplying\nhis own wants with the spoils he should win. At other times he was\ntempted with the desire of putting an end to his miseries and life\ntogether. Yet these were but the transitory suggestions of temporary\nmadness, that soon yielded to the dictates of reason. From the\nexecution of the first he was restrained by his own notions of honour\nand morality; and, from using the other expedient, he was deterred by\nhis love for Monimia, together with the motives of philosophy and\nreligion."

She was alarmed at the\nchange, yet afraid to inquire into the source of it; for, being\nignorant of his distress, she could impute it to no cause in which her\nhappiness was not deeply interested. She had observed his strained\ncomplaisance and extraordinary emotion. She had detected him in\nrepeated attempts to avoid her company, and taken notice of his regular\nexcursions in the dark. These were alarming symptoms to a lover of her\ndelicacy and pride. She strove in vain to put the most favourable\nconstruction on what she saw; and, finally, imputed the effects of his\ndespondence to the alienation of his heart. Made miserable beyond\nexpression by these suspicions, she imparted them to Fathom, who, by\nthis time, was in full possession of her confidence and esteem, and\nimplored his advice touching her conduct in such a nice conjuncture.This artful politician, who rejoiced at the effect of her penetration,\nno sooner heard himself questioned on the subject, than he gave tokens\nof surprise and confusion, signifying his concern to find she had\ndiscovered what, for the honour of his friend, he wished had never come\nto light. His behaviour on this occasion confirmed her fatal\nconjecture; and she conjured him, in the most pathetic manner, to tell\nher if he thought Renaldo’s heart had contracted any new engagement. At\nthis question, he started with signs of extreme agitation, and stifling\nan artificial sigh, “Sure, madam,” said he, “you cannot doubt the\nCount’s constancy—I am confident—he is certainly—I protest, madam, I am\nso shocked.”Here he made a full pause, as if the conflict between his integrity and\nhis friendship would not allow him to proceed, and summoned the\nmoisture into either eye—“Then are my doubts removed,” cried the\nafflicted Monimia; “I see your candour in the midst of your attachment\nto Renaldo; and will no longer torment you with impertinent\ninterrogations and vain complaints.” With these words, a flood of tears\ngushed from her enchanting eyes, and she instantly withdrew into her\nown apartment, where she indulged her sorrow to excess. Nor was her\ngrief unanimated with resentment. She was by birth, nature, and\neducation inspired with that dignity of pride which ennobles the human\nheart; and this, by the circumstance of her present dependence, was\nrendered extremely jealous and susceptible; insomuch that she could not\nbrook the least shadow of indifference, much less an injury of such a\nnature, from the man whom she had honoured with her affections, and for\nwhom she had disobliged and deserted her family and friends."

This pretext of friendly concern is the most\neffectual vehicle for the conveyance of malice and slander; and a man’s\nreputation is never so mortally stabbed, as when the assassin begins\nwith the preamble of, “For my own part, I can safely say that no man\nupon earth has a greater regard for him than I have; and it is with the\nutmost anguish and concern that I see him misbehave in such a manner.”\nThen he proceeds to mangle his character, and the good-natured hearers,\nconcluding he is even blacker than he is represented, on the\nsupposition that the most atrocious circumstances are softened or\nsuppressed by the tenderness or friendship of the accuser, exclaim,\n“Good lack! what a wretch he must be, when his best friends will no\nlonger attempt to defend him!” Nay, sometimes these well-wishers\nundertake his defence, and treacherously betray the cause they have\nespoused, by omitting the reasons that may be urged in his vindication."

  "content": "Both these methods were practised by the wily Ferdinand, according to\nthe predominant passion of Monimia. When her indignation prevailed, he\nexpatiated upon his love and sincere regard for Renaldo, which, he\nsaid, had grown up from the cradle, to such a degree of fervour, that\nhe would willingly part with life for his advantage. He shed tears for\nhis apostasy; but every drop made an indelible stain upon his\ncharacter; and, in the bitterness of his grief, swore, notwithstanding\nhis fondness for Renaldo, which had become a part of his constitution,\nthat the young Hungarian deserved the most infamous destiny for having\ninjured such perfection. At other times, when he found her melted into\nsilent sorrow, he affected to excuse the conduct of his friend. He\ninformed her, that the young gentleman’s temper had been uneven from\nhis infancy; that frailty was natural to man; that he might in time be\nreclaimed by self-conviction; he even hinted, that she might have\nprobably ascribed to inconstancy, what was really the effect of some\nchagrin which he industriously concealed from his participation. But,\nwhen he found her disposed to listen to this last suggestion, he\ndestroyed the force of it, by recollecting the circumstances of his\nnocturnal rambles, which, he owned, would admit of no favourable\nconstruction.By these means he blew the coals of her jealousy, and enhanced the\nvalue of his own character at the same time; for she looked upon him as\na mirror of faith and integrity, and the mind being overcharged with\nwoe, naturally seeks some confidant, upon whose sympathy it can repose\nitself. Indeed, his great aim was to make himself necessary to her\naffliction, and settle a gossiping correspondence, in the familiarity\nof which he hoped his purpose would certainly be answered.Yet the exertion of these talents was not limited to her alone. While\nhe laid these trains for the hapless young lady, he was preparing\nsnares of another kind for her unsuspecting lover, who, for the\ncompletion of his misery, about this time began to perceive marks of\ndisquiet and displeasure in the countenance and deportment of his\nadored Monimia. For that young lady, in the midst of her grief,\nremembered her origin, and over her vexation affected to throw a veil\nof tranquillity, which served only to give an air of disgust to her\ninternal disturbance."
