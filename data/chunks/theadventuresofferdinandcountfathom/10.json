  "content": "A man of our hero’s politeness could not help expressing himself in the\nwarmest terms of gratitude for this courteous declaration. He thanked\nthe captain in particular for his obliging offers, and begged he would\nbe so good as to present his respects to the society, of which he\nlonged to be a member. It was determined, therefore, that Minikin\nshould return in an hour, when the Count would be dressed, in order to\nconduct him into the presence of his majesty; and he had already taken\nhis leave for the present, when all of a sudden he came back, and\ntaking hold of a waistcoat that lay upon a chair, “Sir,” said he, “give\nme leave to look at that fringe; I think it is the most elegant\nknitting I ever saw. But pray, sir, are not these quite out of fashion?\nI thought plain silk, such as this that I wear, had been the mode, with\nthe pockets very low.” Before Fathom had time to make any sort of\nreply, he took notice of his hat and pumps; the first of which, he\nsaid, was too narrow in the brims, and the last an inch too low in the\nheels. Indeed, they formed a remarkable contrast with his own; for,\nexclusive of the fashion of the cock, which resembled the form of a\nRoman galley, the brim of his hat, if properly spread, would have\nprojected a shade sufficient to shelter a whole file of musketeers from\nthe heat of a summer’s sun; and the heels of his shoes were so high as\nto raise his feet three inches at least from the surface of the earth.Having made these observations, for the credit of his taste, he\nretired, and returning at the time appointed, accompanied Ferdinand to\nthe apartment of the king, at the doors of which their ears were\ninvaded with a strange sound, being that of a human voice imitating the\nnoise of a drum. The captain, hearing this alarm, made a full stop,\nand, giving the Count to understand that his majesty was busy, begged\nhe would not take it amiss, if the introduction should be delayed for a\nfew moments. Fathom, curious to know the meaning of what he had heard,\napplied to his guide for information, and learned that the king and the\nmajor, whom he had nominated to the post of his general-in-chief, were\nemployed in landing troops upon the Genoese territory; that is, that\nthey were settling beforehand the manner of their disembarkation.He then, by the direction of his conductor, reconnoitred them through\nthe keyhole, and perceived the sovereign and his minister sitting on\nopposite sides of a deal board table, covered with a large chart or\nmap, upon which he saw a great number of mussel and oyster shells\nranged in a certain order, and, at a little distance, several regular\nsquares and columns made of cards cut in small pieces. The prince\nhimself, whose eyes were reinforced by spectacles, surveyed this\narmament with great attention, while the general put the whole in\naction, and conducted their motions by beat of drum. The mussel-shells,\naccording to Minikin’s explanation, represented the transports, the\noyster-shells were considered as the men-of-war that covered the troops\nin landing, and the pieces of card exhibited the different bodies into\nwhich the army was formed upon its disembarkation."

  "content": "As an affair of such consequence could not be transacted without\nopposition, they had provided divers ambuscades, consisting of the\nenemy, whom they represented by grey peas; and accordingly General\nMacleaver, perceiving the said grey peas marching along shore to attack\nhis forces before they could be drawn up in battalia, thus addressed\nhimself to the oyster-shells, in an audible voice:—“You men-of-war,\ndon’t you see the front of the enemy advancing, and the rest of the\ndetachment following out of sight? Arrah! the devil burn you, why don’t\nyou come ashore and open your batteries?” So saying, he pushed the\nshells towards the breach, performed the cannonading with his voice,\nthe grey peas were soon put in confusion, the general was beat, the\ncards marched forwards in order of battle, and the enemy having\nretreated with great precipitation, they took possession of their\nground without farther difficulty.CHAPTER FORTYHE CONTEMPLATES MAJESTY AND ITS SATELLITES IN ECLIPSE.This expedition being happily finished, General Macleaver put the whole\narmy, navy, transports, and scene of action into a canvas bag, the\nprince unsaddled his nose, and Captain Minikin being admitted, our hero\nwas introduced in form. Very gracious was the reception he met with\nfrom his majesty, who, with a most princely demeanour, welcomed him to\ncourt, and even seated him on his right hand, in token of particular\nregard. True it is, this presence-chamber was not so superb, nor the\nappearance of the king so magnificent, as to render such an honour\nintoxicating to any person of our hero’s coolness and discretion. In\nlieu of tapestry, the apartment was hung with halfpenny ballads, a\ntruckle-bed without curtains supplied the place of a canopy, and\ninstead of a crown his majesty wore a woollen night-cap. Yet, in spite\nof these disadvantages, there was an air of dignity in his deportment,\nand a nice physiognomist would have perceived something majestic in the\nfeatures of his countenance."

  "content": "He was certainly a personage of very prepossessing mien; his manners\nwere engaging, his conversation agreeable, and any man whose heart was\nsubject to the meltings of humanity would have deplored his distress,\nand looked upon him as a most pathetic instance of that miserable\nreverse to which all human grandeur is exposed. His fall was even\ngreater than that of Belisarius, who, after having obtained many\nglorious victories over the enemies of his country, is said to have\nbeen reduced to such extremity of indigence, that, in his old age, when\nhe was deprived of his eyesight, he sat upon the highway like a common\nmendicant, imploring the charity of passengers in the piteous\nexclamation of Date obolum Belisario; that is, “Spare a farthing to\nyour poor old soldier Belisarius.” I say, this general’s disgrace was\nnot so remarkable as that of Theodore, because he was the servant of\nJustinian, consequently his fortune depended upon the nod of that\nemperor; whereas the other actually possessed the throne of sovereignty\nby the best of all titles, namely, the unanimous election of the people\nover whom he reigned; and attracted the eyes of all Europe, by the\nefforts he made in breaking the bands of oppression, and vindicating\nthat liberty which is the birthright of man.The English of former days, alike renowned for generosity and valour,\ntreated those hostile princes, whose fate it was to wear their chains,\nwith such delicacy of benevolence, as even dispelled the horrors of\ncaptivity; but their posterity of this refined age feel no compunction\nat seeing an unfortunate monarch, their former friend, ally, and\npartisan, languish amidst the miseries of a loathsome jail, for a\npaltry debt contracted in their own service. But, moralising apart, our\nhero had not long conversed with this extraordinary debtor, who in his\npresent condition assumed no other title than that of Baron, than he\nperceived in him a spirit of Quixotism, which all his experience,\ntogether with the vicissitudes of his fortune, had not been able to\novercome. Not that his ideas soared to such a pitch of extravagant hope\nas that which took possession of his messmates, who frequently\nquarrelled one with another about the degrees of favour to which they\nshould be entitled after the king’s restoration; but he firmly believed\nthat affairs would speedily take such a turn in Italy, as would point\nout to the English court the expediency of employing him again; and his\npersuasion seemed to support him against every species of poverty and\nmortification.While they were busy in trimming the balance of power on the other side\nof the Alps, their deliberations were interrupted by the arrival of a\nscullion, who came to receive their orders touching the bill of fare\nfor dinner, and his majesty found much more difficulty in settling this\nimportant concern, than in compromising all the differences between the\nEmperor and the Queen of Spain. At length, however, General Macleaver\nundertook the office of purveyor for his prince; Captain Minikin\ninsisted upon treating the Count; and in a little time the table was\ncovered with a cloth, which, for the sake of my delicate readers, I\nwill not attempt to describe."

  "content": "At this period they were joined by Sir Mungo Barebones, who, having\nfound means to purchase a couple of mutton chops, had cooked a mess of\nbroth, which he now brought in a saucepan to the general rendezvous.\nThis was the most remarkable object which had hitherto presented itself\nto the eyes of Fathom. Being naturally of a meagre habit, he was, by\nindigence and hard study, wore almost to the bone, and so bended\ntowards the earth, that in walking his body described at least 150\ndegrees of a circle. The want of stockings and shoes he supplied with a\njockey straight boot and an half jack. His thighs and middle were cased\nin a monstrous pair of brown trunk breeches, which the keeper bought\nfor his use from the executor of a Dutch seaman who had lately died in\nthe jail. His shirt retained no signs of its original colour, his body\nwas shrouded in an old greasy tattered plaid nightgown; a blue and\nwhite handkerchief surrounded his head, and his looks betokened that\nimmense load of care which he had voluntarily incurred for the eternal\nsalvation of sinners. Yet this figure, uncouth as it was, made his\ncompliments to our adventurer in terms of the most elegant address,\nand, in the course of conversation, disclosed a great fund of valuable\nknowledge. He had appeared in the great world, and borne divers offices\nof dignity and trust with universal applause. His courage was\nundoubted, his morals were unimpeached, and his person held in great\nveneration and esteem; when his evil genius engaged him in the study of\nHebrew, and the mysteries of the Jewish religion, which fairly\ndisordered his brain, and rendered him incapable of managing his\ntemporal affairs. When he ought to have been employed in the functions\nof his post, he was always wrapt in visionary conferences with Moses on\nthe Mount; rather than regulate the economy of his household, he chose\nto exert his endeavours in settling the precise meaning of the word\nElohim; and having discovered that now the period was come, when the\nJews and Gentiles would be converted, he postponed every other\nconsideration, in order to facilitate that great and glorious event."

The king\nregaled himself with a plate of ox-cheek; the major, who complained\nthat his appetite had forsaken him, amused himself with some forty hard\neggs, malaxed with salt butter; the knight indulged upon his soup and\nbouilli, and the captain entertained our adventurer with a neck of veal\nroasted with potatoes; but before Fathom could make use of his knife\nand fork, he was summoned to the door, where he found the chevalier in\ngreat agitation, his eyes sparkling like coals of fire.Our hero was not a little surprised at this apparition, who, having\nasked pardon for the freedom he had used, observed, that, understanding\nthe Count was a foreigner, he could not dispense with appealing to him\nconcerning an outrage he had suffered from the keeper, who, without any\nregard to his rank or misfortunes, had been base enough to refuse him\ncredit for a few necessaries, until he could have a remittance from his\nsteward in France; he therefore conjured Count Fathom, as a stranger\nand nobleman like himself, to be the messenger of defiance, which he\nresolved to send to that brutal jailor, that, for the future, he might\nlearn to make proper distinctions in the exercise of his function."

Though his age did not exceed thirty\nyears, his beard, which was of a brindled hue, flowed down, like\nAaron’s, to his middle. Upon his legs he wore red stockings rolled up\nover the joint of the knee, his breeches were of blue drab, with vellum\nbutton-holes, and garters of gold lace, his waistcoat of scarlet, his\ncoat of rusty black cloth, his hair, twisted into a ramilie, hung down\nto his rump, of the colour of jet, and his hat was adorned with a white\nfeather.This original had formed many ingenious schemes to increase the glory\nand grandeur of France, but was discouraged by Cardinal Fleury, who, in\nall appearance, jealous of his great talents, not only rejected his\nprojects, but even sent him to prison, on pretence of being offended at\nhis impertinence. Perceiving that, like the prophet, he had no honour\nin his own country, he no sooner obtained his release, than he retired\nto England, where he was prompted by his philanthropy to propose an\nexpedient to our ministry, which would have saved a vast effusion of\nblood and treasure; this was an agreement between the Queen of Hungary\nand the late Emperor, to decide their pretensions by a single combat;\nin which case he offered himself as the Bavarian champion; but in this\nendeavour he also proved unsuccessful. Then turning his attention to\nthe delights of poetry, he became so enamoured of the muse, that he\nneglected every other consideration, and she as usual gradually\nconducted him to the author’s never-failing goal—a place of rest\nappointed for all those sinners whom the profane love of poesy hath led\nastray.CHAPTER FORTY-ONEONE QUARREL IS COMPROMISED, AND ANOTHER DECIDED BY UNUSUAL ARMS."

  "content": "Among other topics of conversation that were discussed at this genial\nmeeting, Sir Mungo’s scheme was brought upon the carpet by his majesty,\nwho was graciously pleased to ask how his subscription filled? To this\ninterrogation the knight answered, that he met with great opposition\nfrom a spirit of levity and self-conceit, which seemed to prevail in\nthis generation, but that no difficulties should discourage him from\npersevering in his duty; and he trusted in God, that, in a very little\ntime, he should be able to confute and overthrow the false philosophy\nof the moderns, and to restore the writings of Moses to that\npre-eminence and veneration which is due to an inspired author. He\nspoke of the immortal Newton with infinite contempt, and undertook to\nextract from the Pentateuch a system of chronology which would\nascertain the progress of time since the fourth day of the creation to\nthe present hour, with such exactness, that not one vibration of a\npendulum should be lost; nay, he affirmed that the perfection of all\narts and sciences might be attained by studying these secret memoirs,\nand that he himself did not despair of learning from them the art of\ntransmuting baser metals into gold.The chevalier, though he did not pretend to contradict these\nassertions, was too much attached to his own religion to acquiesce in\nthe knight’s project of converting the Jews and the Gentiles to the\nProtestant heresy, which, he said, God Almighty would never suffer to\ntriumph over the interests of his own Holy Catholic Church. This\nobjection produced abundance of altercation between two very unequal\ndisputants; and the Frenchman, finding himself puzzled by the learning\nof his antagonist, had recourse to the argumentum ad hominem, by laying\nhis hand upon his sword, and declaring that he was ready to lose the\nlast drop of his blood in opposition to such a damnable scheme.Sir Mungo, though in all appearance reduced to the last stage of animal\nexistence, no sooner heard this epithet applied to his plan, than his\neyes gleamed like lightning, he sprung from his seat with the agility\nof a grasshopper, and, darting himself out at the door like an arrow\nfrom a bow, reappeared in a moment with a long rusty weapon, which\nmight have been shown among a collection of rarities as the sword of\nGuy Earl of Warwick. This implement he brandished over the chevalier’s\nhead with the dexterity of an old prize-fighter, exclaiming, in the\nFrench language, “Thou art a profane wretch marked out for the\nvengeance of Heaven, whose unworthy minister I am, and here thou shalt\nfall by the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.”The chevalier, unterrified by this dreadful salutation, desired he\nwould accompany him to a more convenient place; and the world might\nhave been deprived of one or both these knights-errant, had not General\nMacleaver, at the desire of his majesty, interposed, and found means to\nbring matters to an accommodation."

I have always admired that speech of Hotspur in the first part of\nHenry the Fourth:By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,\nTo pluck bright honour from the pale-fac’d moon;\nOr dive into the bottom of the deep,\nWhere fathom-line could never touch the ground,\nAnd pluck up drowned honour by the locks—“There is a boldness and ease in the expression, and the images are\nvery picturesque. But, without any further preamble, pray, sir, give me\nleave to ask how long you have been acquainted with those ladies who\ndrank tea with us this afternoon. You’ll forgive the question, sir,\nwhen I tell you that Major Macleaver introduced Mrs. Minikin to them as\nto ladies of character, and, I don’t know how, sir, I have a sort of\npresentiment that my wife has been imposed upon. Perhaps I may be\nmistaken, and God grant I may. But there was a je ne sais quoi in their\nbehaviour to-day, which begins to alarm my suspicion. Sir, I have\nnothing but my reputation to depend upon, and I hope you will excuse\nme, when I earnestly beg to know what rank they maintain in life.”Fathom, without minding the consequence, told him, with a simper, that\nhe knew them to be very good-natured ladies, who devoted themselves to\nthe happiness of mankind. This explanation had no sooner escaped from\nhis lips, than the captain’s face began to glow with indignation, his\neyes seemed bursting from their spheres, he swelled to twice his\nnatural dimensions, and, raising himself on his tiptoes, pronounced, in\na strain that emulated thunder, “Blood! sir, you seem to make very\nlight of the matter, but it is no joke to me, I’ll assure you, and\nMacleaver shall see that I am not to be affronted with impunity. Sir, I\nshall take it as a singular favour if you will be the bearer of a\nbillet to him, which I shall write in three words; nay, sir, you must\ngive me leave to insist upon it, as you are the only gentleman of our\nmess whom I can intrust with an affair of this nature.”"

I therefore\ndemand such satisfaction as a soldier ought to receive, and expect you\nwill adjust with my friend Count Fathom the terms upon which you shall\nbe met by the much injuredGOLIAH MINIKIN.”This morceau being sealed and directed, was forthwith carried by our\nadventurer to the lodgings of the major, who had by this time retired\nto rest, but hearing the Count’s voice, he got up and opened the door\nin cuerpo, to the astonishment of Ferdinand, who had never before seen\nsuch an Herculean figure. He made an apology for receiving the Count in\nhis birthday suit, to which he said he was reduced by the heat of his\nconstitution, though he might have assigned a more adequate cause, by\nowning that his shirt was in the hands of his washerwoman; then\nshrouding himself in a blanket, desired to know what had procured him\nthe honour of such an extraordinary visit. He read the letter with\ngreat composure, like a man accustomed to such intercourse; then\naddressing himself to the bearer, “I will be after diverting the\ngentleman,” said he, “in any manner he shall think proper; but, by\nJesus, this is no place for such amusements, because, as you well know,\nmy dear Count, if both should be killed by the chance of war, neither\nof us will be able to escape, and after the breath is out of his body,\nhe will make but a sorry excuse to his family and friends. But that is\nno concern of mine, and therefore I am ready to please him in his own\nway.”"

I\nhave served a long apprenticeship to fighting, as this same carcase can\ntestify, and if he compels me to run him through the body, by my shoul,\nI shall do it in a friendly manner.”So saying, he threw aside the blanket, and displayed scars and seams\ninnumerable upon his body, which appeared like an old patched leathern\ndoublet. “I remember,” proceeded this champion, “when I was a slave at\nAlgiers, Murphy Macmorris and I happened to have some difference in the\nbagnio, upon which he bade me turn out. ‘Arra, for what?’ said I; ‘here\nare no weapons that a gentleman can use, and you would not be such a\nnegro as to box like an English carman.’ After he had puzzled himself\nfor some time, he proposed that we should retire into a corner, and\nfunk one another with brimstone, till one of us should give out.\nAccordingly we crammed half a dozen tobacco pipes with sulphur, and,\nsetting foot to foot, began to smoke, and kept a constant fire, until\nMacmorris dropped down; then I threw away my pipe, and taking poor\nMurphy in my arms, ‘What, are you dead?’ said I; ‘if you are dead,\nspeak.’ ‘No, by Jesus!’ cried he, ‘I an’t dead, but I’m speechless.’ So\nhe owned I had obtained the victory, and we were as good friends as\never. Now, if Mr. Minikin thinks proper to put the affair upon the same\nissue, I will smoke a pipe of brimstone with him to-morrow morning, and\nif I cry out first, I will be after asking pardon for this supposed\naffront.”"

He\ntherefore suggested another expedient in lieu of the sulphur, namely,\nthe gum called assafatida, which, though abundantly nauseous, could\nhave no effect upon the infirm texture of the lieutenant’s lungs. This\nhint being relished by the major, our adventurer returned to his\nprincipal, and having repeated the other’s arguments against the use of\nmortal instruments, described the succedaneum which he had concerted\nwith Macleaver. The captain at first believed the scheme was calculated\nfor subjecting him to the ridicule of his fellow-prisoners, and began\nto storm with great violence; but, by the assurances and address of\nFathom, he was at length reconciled to the plan, and preparations were\nmade on each side for this duel, which was actually smoked next day,\nabout noon, in a small closet, detached from the challenger’s\napartment, and within hearing of his majesty, and all his court,\nassembled as witnesses and umpires of the contest.The combatants, being locked up together, began to ply their engines\nwith great fury, and it was not long before Captain Minikin perceived\nhe had a manifest advantage over his antagonist. For his organs were\nfamiliarised to the effluvia of this drug, which he had frequently used\nin the course of an hypochondriac disorder; whereas Macleaver, who was\na stranger to all sorts of medicine, by his wry faces and attempts to\npuke, expressed the utmost abhorrence of the smell that invaded his\nnostrils. Nevertheless, resolved to hold out to the last extremity, he\ncontinued in action until the closet was filled with such an\nintolerable vapour as discomposed the whole economy of his entrails,\nand compelled him to disgorge his breakfast in the face of his\nopponent, whose nerves were so disconcerted by this disagreeable and\nunforeseen discharge, that he fell back into his chair in a swoon, and\nthe major bellowed aloud for assistance. The door being opened, he ran\ndirectly to the window, to inhale the fresh air, while the captain,\nrecovering from his fit, complained of Macleaver’s unfair proceeding,\nand demanded justice of the arbitrators, who decided in his favour; and\nthe major being prevailed upon to ask pardon for having introduced Mrs.\nMinikin to women of rotten reputation, the parties were reconciled to\neach other, and peace and concord re-established in the mess.Fathom acquired universal applause for his discreet and humane conduct\nupon this occasion; and that same afternoon had an opportunity of\nseeing the lady in whose cause he had exerted himself. He was presented\nto her as the husband’s particular friend, and when she understood how\nmuch she was indebted to his care and concern for the captain’s safety,\nshe treated him with uncommon marks of distinction; and he found her a\ngenteel, well-bred woman, not without a good deal of personal charms,\nand a well-cultivated understanding.CHAPTER FORTY-TWO"

These\nfirst transports having subsided, they adjourned to the lodgings of\nFathom, who soon recollected his spirits and invention so well as to\namuse the other with a feigned tale of his having been taken by the\nFrench, sent prisoner into Champagne, from whence he had written many\nletters to Count Melvil and his son, of whom he could hear no tidings;\nof his having contracted an intimacy with a young nobleman of France,\nwho died in the flower of his age, after having, in token of his\nfriendship, bequeathed to him a considerable legacy; by this he had\nbeen enabled to visit the land of his forefathers in the character of a\ngentleman, which he had supported with some figure, until he was\nbetrayed into a misfortune that exhausted his funds, and drove him to\nthe spot where he was now found. And he solemnly declared, that, far\nfrom forgetting the obligation he owed to Count Melvil, or renouncing\nthe friendship of Renaldo, he had actually resolved to set out for\nGermany on his return to the house of his patron in the beginning of\nthe week posterior to that in which he had been arrested.Young Melvil, whose own heart had never known the instigations of\nfraud, implicitly believed the story and protestations of Fathom; and\nthough he would not justify that part of his conduct by which the term\nof his good fortune was abridged, he could not help excusing an\nindiscretion into which he had been hurried by the precipitancy of\nyouth, and the allurements of an artful woman. Nay, with the utmost\nwarmth of friendship, he undertook to wait upon Trapwell, and endeavour\nto soften him into some reasonable terms of composition.Fathom seemed to be quite overwhelmed with a deep sense of all this\ngoodness, and affected the most eager impatience to know the\nparticulars of Renaldo’s fate, since their unhappy separation, more\nespecially his errand to this uncomfortable place, which he should\nhenceforth revere as the providential scene of their reunion. Nor did\nhe forget to inquire, in the most affectionate and dutiful manner,\nabout the situation of his noble parents and amiable sister."

  "content": "At mention of these names, Renaldo, fetching a deep sigh, “Alas! my\nfriend,” said he, “the Count is no more; and, what aggravates my\naffliction for the loss of such a father, it was my misfortune to be\nunder his displeasure at the time of his death. Had I been present on\nthat melancholy occasion, so well I knew his generosity and paternal\ntenderness, that, sure I am, he would in his last moments have forgiven\nan only son, whose life had been a continual effort to render himself\nworthy of such a parent, and whose crime was no other than an\nhonourable passion for the most meritorious of her sex. But I was\nremoved at a fatal distance from him, and doubtless my conduct must\nhave been invidiously misrepresented. Be that as it will, my mother has\nagain given her hand in wedlock to Count Trebasi; by whom I have the\nmortification to be informed that I am totally excluded from my\nfather’s succession; and I learn from other quarters, that my sister is\nbarbarously treated by this inhuman father-in-law. Grant, Heaven, I may\nsoon have an opportunity of expostulating with the tyrant upon that\nsubject.”So saying, his cheeks glowed, and his eyes lightened with resentment.\nThen he thus proceeded: “My coming hither to-day was with a view to\nvisit a poor female relation, from whom I yesterday received a letter,\ndescribing her most deplorable situation, and soliciting my assistance;\nbut the turnkey affirms that there is no such person in the jail, and I\nwas on my way to consult the keeper, when I was agreeably surprised\nwith the sight of my dear Fathom.”Our adventurer having wiped from his eyes the tears which were produced\nby the news of his worthy patron’s death, desired to know the name of\nthat afflicted prisoner, in whose behalf he interested himself so much,\nand Renaldo produced the letter, subscribed, “Your unfortunate cousin,\nHelen Melvil.” This pretended relation, after having explained the\ndegree of consanguinity which she and the Count stood in to each other,\nand occasionally mentioned some anecdotes of the family in Scotland,\ngave him to understand that she had married a merchant of London, who,\nby repeated losses in trade, had been reduced to indigence, and\nafterwards confined to prison, where he then lay a breathless corpse,\nhaving left her in the utmost extremity of wretchedness and want, with\ntwo young children in the smallpox, and an incurable cancer in one of\nher own breasts. Indeed, the picture she drew was so moving, and her\nexpressions so sensibly pathetic, that no person, whose heart was not\naltogether callous, could peruse it without emotion. Renaldo had sent\ntwo guineas by the messenger, whom she had represented as a trusty\nservant, whose fidelity had been proof against all the distress of her\nmistress; and he was now arrived in order to reinforce his bounty."

  "content": "Fathom, in the consciousness of his own practices, immediately\ncomprehended the scheme of this letter, and confidently assured him\nthat no such person resided in the prison or in any other place. And\nwhen his friend applied for information to the keeper, these assurances\nwere confirmed; and that stern janitor told him he had been imposed\nupon by a stale trick, which was often practised upon strangers by a\nset of sharpers, who make it their business to pick up hints of\nintelligence relating to private families, upon which they build such\nsuperstructures of fraud and imposition.However piqued the young Hungarian might be to find himself duped in\nthis manner, he rejoiced at the occasion which had thrown Fathom in his\nway; and, after having made him a tender of his purse, took his leave,\non purpose to wait upon Trapwell, who was not quite so untractable as\nan enraged cuckold commonly is; for, by this time, he had accomplished\nthe best part of his aim, which was to be divorced from his wife, and\nwas fully convinced that the defendant was no more than a needy\nadventurer, who, in all probability, would be released by an act of\nparliament for the benefit of insolvent debtors; in which case, he, the\nplaintiff, would reap no solid advantage from his imprisonment.He, therefore, listened to the remonstrances of the mediator, and,\nafter much canvassing, agreed to discharge the defendant, in\nconsideration of two hundred pounds, which were immediately paid by\nCount Melvil, who, by this deduction, was reduced to somewhat less than\nthirty.Nevertheless, he cheerfully beggared himself in behalf of his friend,\nfor whose release he forthwith obtained an order; and, next day, our\nadventurer, having bid a formal adieu to his fellows in distress, and,\nin particular, to his majesty, for whose restoration his prayers were\npreferred, he quitted the jail, and accompanied his deliverer, with all\nthe outward marks of unutterable gratitude and esteem.Surely, if his heart had been made of penetrable stuff, it would have\nbeen touched by the circumstances of this redemption; but had not his\nsoul been invincible to all such attacks, these memoirs would possibly\nnever have seen the light."

He told him,\nthat, immediately after the war was finished, his father had pressed\nhim to a very advantageous match, with which he would have complied,\nthough his heart was not at all concerned, had not he been inflamed\nwith the desire of seeing the world before he could take any step\ntowards a settlement for life. That he had signified his sentiments on\nthis head to the Count, who opposed them with unusual obstinacy, as\nproductive of a delay which might be fatal to his proposal; for which\nreason he had retired incognito from his family, and travelled through\nsundry states and countries, in a disguise by which he eluded the\ninquiries of his parents.That, in the course of these peregrinations, he was captivated by the\nirresistible charms of a young lady, on whose heart he had the good\nfortune to make a tender impression. That their mutual love had\nsubjected both to many dangers and difficulties, during which they\nsuffered a cruel separation; after the torments of which, he had\nhappily found her in England, where she now lived entirely cut off from\nher native country and connexions, and destitute of every other\nresource but his honour, love, and protection. And, finally, that he\nwas determined to combat his own desires, how violent soever they might\nbe, until he should have made some suitable provision for the\nconsequences of a stricter union with the mistress of his soul, that he\nmight not, by a precipitate marriage, ruin the person whom he adored.This end he proposed to attain, by an application to the court of\nVienna, which he did not doubt would have some regard to his own\nservice, and that of his father; and thither he resolved to repair,\nwith the first opportunity, now that he had found a friend with whom he\ncould intrust the inestimable jewel of his heart.He likewise gave our hero to understand, that he had been eight months\nin England, during which he had lived in a frugal manner, that he might\nnot unnecessarily exhaust the money he had been able to raise upon his\nown credit; that, hitherto, he had been obliged to defer his departure\nfor Germany on account of his attendance upon the mother of his\nmistress, who was lately dead of sorrow and chagrin; and that, since he\nresided in London, he had often heard of the celebrated Count Fathom,\nthough he never imagined that his friend Ferdinand could be\ndistinguished by that appellation.CHAPTER FORTY-THREEFATHOM JUSTIFIES THE PROVERB, “WHAT’S BRED IN THE BONE WILL NEVER COME\nOUT OF THE FLESH.”"

  "content": "Some circumstances of this conversation made a deep impression upon the\nmind of our adventurer, who nevertheless concealed his emotions from\nthe knowledge of his friend, and was next day introduced to that hidden\ntreasure of which Renaldo had spoken with such rapture and adoration.\nIt was not without reason he had expatiated upon the personal\nattractions of this young lady, whom, for the present, we shall call\nMonimia, a name that implies her orphan situation. When she entered the\nroom, even Fathom, whose eyes had been sated with beauty, was struck\ndumb with admiration, and could scarce recollect himself so far as to\nperform the ceremony of his introduction.She seemed to be about the age of eighteen. Her stature was tall; her\nmotion graceful. A knot of artificial flowers restrained the luxuriancy\nof her fine black hair, that flowed in shining ringlets adown her snowy\nneck. The contour of her face was oval; her forehead remarkably high;\nher complexion clean and delicate, though not florid; and her eyes were\nso piercing, as to strike the soul of every beholder. Yet, upon this\noccasion, one half of their vivacity was eclipsed by a languishing air\nof melancholy concern; which, while it in a manner sheathed the edge of\nher beauty, added a most engaging sweetness to her looks. In short,\nevery feature was elegantly perfect; and the harmony of the whole\nravishing and delightful.It was easy to perceive the mutual sentiments of the two lovers at\nmeeting, by the pleasure that sensibly diffused itself in the\ncountenances of both. Fathom was received by her as the intimate friend\nof her admirer, whom she had often heard of in terms of the most\nsincere affection; and the conversation was carried on in the Italian\nlanguage, because she was a foreigner who had not as yet made great\nproficiency in the knowledge of the English tongue. Her understanding\nwas such as, instead of diminishing, reinforced the prepossession which\nwas inspired by her appearance; and if the sum-total of her charms\ncould not melt the heart, it at least excited the appetite of Fathom to\nsuch a degree, that he gazed upon her with such violence of desire, as\nhad never transported him before; and he instantly began to harbour\nthoughts, not only destructive to the peace of his generous patron, but\nalso to the prudential maxims he had adopted on his first entrance into\nlife."

  "content": "We have already recorded divers instances of his conduct to prove that\nthere was an intemperance in his blood, which often interfered with his\ncaution; and although he had found means to render this heat sometimes\nsubservient to his interest, yet, in all probability, Heaven mingled\nthe ingredient in his constitution, on purpose to counteract his\nconsummate craft, defeat the villany of his intention, and at least\nexpose him to the justice of the law, and the contempt of his\nfellow-creatures.Stimulated as he was by the beauty of the incomparable Monimia, he\nforesaw that the conquest of her heart would cost him a thousand times\nmore labour and address than all the victories he had ever achieved;\nfor, besides her superior understanding, her sentiments of honour,\nvirtue, gratitude, religion, and pride of birth, her heart was already\nengaged by the tenderest ties of love and obligation, to a man whose\nperson and acquired accomplishments at least equalled his own; and\nwhose connexion with him was of such a nature as raised an almost\ninsurmountable bar to his design; because, with what face could he\ncommence rival to the person whose family had raised him from want and\nservility, and whose own generosity had rescued him from the miseries\nof a dreary gaol?Notwithstanding these reflections, he would not lay aside an idea which\nso agreeably flattered his imagination. He, like every other projector\nin the same circumstances, was so partial to his own qualifications, as\nto think the lady would soon perceive a difference between him and\nRenaldo that could not fail to turn to his advantage in her opinion. He\ndepended a good deal on the levity and inconstancy of the sex; and did\nnot doubt that, in the course of their acquaintance, he should profit\nby that languor which often creeps upon and flattens the intercourse of\nlovers cloyed with the sight and conversation of each other."

  "content": "This way of arguing was very natural to a man who had never known other\nmotives than those of sensuality and convenience; and perhaps, upon\nthese maxims, he might have succeeded with nine-tenths of the fair sex.\nBut, for once, he erred in his calculation; Monimia’s soul was perfect,\nher virtue impregnable. His first approaches were, as usual, performed\nby the method of insinuation, which succeeded so well, that in a few\ndays he actually acquired a very distinguished share of her favour and\nesteem. To this he had been recommended, in the warmest strain of\nexaggerating friendship, by her dear Renaldo; so that, placing the most\nunreserved confidence in his honour and integrity, and being almost\nquite destitute of acquaintance, she made no scruple of owning herself\npleased with his company and conversation; and therefore he was never\nabridged in point of opportunity. She had too much discernment to\noverlook his uncommon talents and agreeable address, and too much\nsusceptibility to observe them with indifference. She not only regarded\nhim as the confidant of her lover, but admired him as a person whose\nattachment did honour to Count Melvil’s choice. She found his discourse\nremarkably entertaining, his politeness dignified with an air of\nuncommon sincerity, and she was ravished with his skill in music, an\nart of which she was deeply enamoured.While he thus ingratiated himself with the fair Monimia, Renaldo\nrejoiced at their intimacy, being extremely happy in the thought of\nhaving found a friend who could amuse and protect the dear creature in\nhis absence. That she might be the better prepared for the temporary\nseparation which he meditated, he began to be less frequent in his\nvisits, or rather to interrupt, by gradual intermissions, the constant\nattendance he had bestowed upon her since her mother’s death. This\nalteration she was enabled to bear by the assiduities of Fathom, when\nshe understood that her lover was indispensably employed in negotiating\na sum of money for the purposes of his intended voyage. This was really\nthe case; for, as the reader hath been already informed, the provision\nhe had made for that emergency was expended in behalf of our\nadventurer; and the persons of whom he had borrowed it, far from\napproving of the use to which it was put, and accommodating him with a\nfresh supply, reproached him with his benevolence as an act of\ndishonesty to them; and, instead of favouring this second application,\nthreatened to distress him for what he had already received. While he\nendeavoured to surmount these difficulties, his small reversion was\nquite exhausted, and he saw himself on the brink of wanting the common\nnecessaries of life.There was no difficulty which he could not have encountered with\nfortitude, had he alone been concerned. But his affection and regard\nfor Monimia were of such a delicate nature, that, far from being able\nto bear the prospect of her wanting the least convenience, he could not\nendure that she should suspect her situation cost him a moment’s\nperplexity; because he foresaw it would wring her gentle heart with\nunspeakable anguish and vexation. This, therefore, he endeavoured to\nanticipate by expressions of confidence in the Emperor’s equity, and\nfrequent declarations touching the goodness and security of that credit\nfrom which he derived his present subsistence."
