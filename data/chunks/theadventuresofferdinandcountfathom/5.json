The disfiguration of my nose, the pain I have\nundergone, with the discomposure of brain which it produced, I could\nbear as a philosopher; but the disappointment of the ladies, my glory\nwill not permit me to overlook. And as you know the injury was\nsustained in your service, I have the pleasure to hope you will not\nrefuse to grant such reparation as will be acceptable to a gentleman,\nwho has the honour to be with inviolable attachment,—Sir, your most devoted slave,\nPEPIN CLOTHAIRE CHARLE HENRI LOOUIS BARNABE DE FUMIER.”This epistle was so equivocal, that the persons to whom it was\naddressed did not know whether or not they ought to interpret the\ncontents into a challenge; when our hero observed, that the ambiguity\nof his expressions plainly proved there was a door left open for\naccommodation; and proposed that they should forthwith visit the writer\nat his own apartment. They accordingly followed his advice, and found\nthe abbe in his morning gown and slippers, with three huge nightcaps on\nhis head, and a crape hat-band tied over the middle of his face, by way\nof bandage to his nose. He received his visitors with the most\nridiculous solemnity, being still a stranger to the purport of their\nerrand; but soon as the Westphalian declared they were come in\nconsequence of his billet, in order to ask pardon for the undesigned\noffence they had given, his features retrieved their natural vivacity,\nand he professed himself perfectly satisfied with their polite\nacknowledgment. Then they condoled him upon the evil plight of his\nnose, and seeing some marks upon his shirt, asked with seeming concern,\nif he had lost any blood in the fray? To this interrogation he replied,\nthat he had still a sufficient quantity left for the occasions of his\nfriends; and that he should deem it his greatest glory to expend the\nlast drop of it in their service."

It was in consequence of this\nplan, that, after the comedy, they were entertained at the count’s\nlodgings, where quadrille was proposed by the abbe, as the most\ninnocent pastime, and the proposal was immediately embraced by all\npresent, and by none with more alacrity than by our adventurer, who,\nwithout putting forth a moiety of his skill, went home with twenty\nlouis clear gain. Though, far from believing himself greatly superior\nto the rest of the party, in the artifices of play, he justly suspected\nthat they had concealed their skill, with a view of stripping him on\nsome other occasion; for he could not suppose that persons of their\nfigure and character should be, in reality, such novices as they\naffected to appear.CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURHE OVERLOOKS THE ADVANCES OF HIS FRIENDS, AND SMARTS SEVERELY FOR HIS\nNEGLECT.Steeled with this cautious maxim, he guarded himself from their united\nendeavours, in sundry subsequent attacks, by which his first conjecture\nwas confirmed, and still came off conqueror, by virtue of his\nunparalleled finesse and discretion; till at length they seemed to\ndespair of making him their prey, and the count began to drop some\nhints, importing a desire of seeing him more closely united to the\nviews and interest of their triumvirate. But Ferdinand, who was\naltogether selfish, and quite solitary in his prospects, discouraged\nall those advances, being resolved to trade upon his own bottom only,\nand to avoid all such connexions with any person or society whatever;\nmuch more, with a set of raw adventurers whose talents he despised.\nWith these sentiments, he still maintained the dignity and reserve of\nhis first appearance among them, and rather enhanced than diminished\nthat idea of importance which he had inspired at the beginning;\nbecause, besides his other qualifications, they gave him credit for the\naddress with which he kept himself superior to their united designs."

  "content": "While he thus enjoyed his pre-eminence, together with the fruits of his\nsuccess at play, which he managed so discreetly as never to incur the\nreputation of an adventurer, he one day chanced to be at the ordinary,\nwhen the company was surprised by the entrance of such a figure as had\nnever appeared before in that place. This was no other than a person\nhabited in the exact uniform of an English jockey. His leathern cap,\ncut bob, fustian frock, flannel waistcoat, buff breeches, hunting-boots\nand whip, were sufficient of themselves to furnish out a phenomenon for\nthe admiration of all Paris. But these peculiarities were rendered\nstill more conspicuous by the behaviour of the man who owned them. When\nhe crossed the threshold of the outward door, he produced such a sound\nfrom the smack of his whip, as equalled the explosion of an ordinary\ncohorn; and then broke forth into the halloo of a foxhunter, which he\nuttered with all its variations, in a strain of vociferation that\nseemed to astonish and confound the whole assembly, to whom he\nintroduced himself and his spaniel, by exclaiming, in a tone something\nless melodious than the cry of mackerel or live cod, “By your leave,\ngentlevolks, I hope there’s no offence, in an honest plain Englishman’s\ncoming with money in his pocket, to taste a bit of your Vrench frigasee\nand ragooze.”This declaration was made in such a wild, fantastical manner, that the\ngreatest part of the company mistook him for some savage monster or\nmaniac, and consulted their safety by starting up from table, and\ndrawing their swords. The Englishman, seeing such a martial apparatus\nproduced against him, recoiled two or three steps, saying, “Waunds! a\nbelieve the people are all bewitched. What, do they take me for a beast\nof prey? is there nobody here that knows Sir Stentor Stile, or can\nspeak to me in my own lingo?” He had no sooner pronounced these words,\nthan the baronet, with marks of infinite surprise, ran towards him,\ncrying, “Good Heaven! Sir Stentor, who expected to meet with you in\nParis?” Upon which, the other eyeing him very earnestly, “Odds\nheartlikins!” cried he, “my neighbour, Sir Giles Squirrel, as I am a\nliving soul!” With these words he flew upon him like a tiger, kissed\nhim from ear to ear, demolished his periwig, and disordered the whole\neconomy of his dress, to the no small entertainment of the company.Having well-nigh stifled his countryman with embraces, and besmeared\nhimself with pulville from head to foot, he proceeded in this manner,\n“Mercy upon thee, knight, thou art so transmographied, and bedaubed,\nand bedizened, that thou mought rob thy own mother without fear of\ninformation. Look ye here now, I will be trussed, if the very bitch\nthat was brought up in thy own bosom knows thee again. Hey, Sweetlips,\nhere hussy, d—n the tuoad, dos’t n’t know thy old measter? Ey, ey, thou\nmay’st smell till Christmas, I’ll be bound to be hanged, knight, if the\ncreature’s nose an’t foundered by the d——d stinking perfumes you have\ngot among you.”"

  "content": "These compliments being passed, the two knights sat down by one\nanother, and Sir Stentor being asked by his neighbour, upon what errand\nhe had crossed the sea, gave him to understand, that he had come to\nFrance, in consequence of a wager with Squire Snaffle, who had laid a\nthousand pounds, that he, Sir Stentor, would not travel to Paris by\nhimself, and for a whole month appear every day at a certain hour in\nthe public walks, without wearing any other dress than that in which he\nsaw him. “The fellor has got no more stuff in his pate,” continued this\npolite stranger, “than a jackass, to think I could not find my way\nhither thof I could not jabber your French lingo. Ecod! the people of\nthis country are sharp enough to find out your meaning, when you want\nto spend anything among them; and, as for the matter of dress,\nbodikins! for a thousand pound, I would engage to live in the midst of\nthem, and show myself without any clothes at all. Odds heart! a\ntrue-born Englishman needs not be ashamed to show his face, nor his\nbackside neither, with the best Frenchman that ever trod the ground.\nThof we Englishmen don’t beplaister our doublets with gold and silver,\nI believe as how we have our pockets better lined than most of our\nneighbours; and for all my bit of a fustian frock, that cost me in all\nbut forty shillings, I believe, between you and me, knight, I have more\ndust in my fob, than all those powdered sparks put together. But the\nworst of the matter is this; here is no solid belly-timber in this\ncountry. One can’t have a slice of delicate sirloin, or nice buttock of\nbeef, for love nor money. A pize upon them! I could get no eatables\nupon the ruoad, but what they called bully, which looks like the flesh\nof Pharaoh’s lean kine stewed into rags and tatters; and then their\npeajohn, peajohn, rabbet them! One would think every old woman of this\nkingdom hatched pigeons from her own body.”It is not to be supposed that such an original sat unobserved. The\nFrench and other foreigners, who had never been in England, were struck\ndumb with amazement at the knight’s appearance and deportment; while\nthe English guests were overwhelmed with shame and confusion, and kept\na most wary silence, for fear of being recognised by their countryman.\nAs for our adventurer, he was inwardly transported with joy at sight of\nthis curiosity. He considered him as a genuine, rich country booby, of\nthe right English growth, fresh as imported; and his heart throbbed\nwith rapture, when he heard Sir Stentor value himself upon the lining\nof his pockets. He foresaw, indeed, that the other knight would\nendeavour to reserve him for his own game; but he was too conscious of\nhis own accomplishments to think he should find great difficulty in\nsuperseding the influence of Sir Giles."

Ferdinand seized this opportunity of insinuating himself\ninto his favour, by saying in English, he was glad to find there was\nanything in France that was agreeable to Sir Stentor. To this\ncompliment the knight replied with an air of surprise: “Waunds! I find\nhere’s another countryman of mine in this here company. Sir, I am proud\nto see you with all my heart.” So speaking, he thrust out his right\nhand across the table, and shook our hero by the fist, with such\nviolence of civility, as proved very grievous to a French marquis, who,\nin helping himself to soup, was jostled in such a manner, as to\noverturn the dividing-spoon in his own bosom. The Englishman, seeing\nthe mischief he had produced, cried, “No offence, I hope,” in a tone of\nvociferation, which the marquis in all probability misconstrued; for he\nbegan to model his features into a very sublime and peremptory look,\nwhen Fathom interpreted the apology, and at the same time informed Sir\nStentor, that although he himself had not the honour of being an\nEnglishman, he had always entertained a most particular veneration for\nthe country, and learned the language in consequence of that esteem.“Blood!” answered the knight, “I think myself the more obliged to you\nfor your kind opinion, than if you was my countryman in good earnest.\nFor there be abundance of we English—no offence, Sir Giles—that seem to\nbe ashamed of their own nation, and leave their homes to come and spend\ntheir fortunes abroad, among a parcel of—you understand me, sir—a word\nto the wise, as the saying is.”—Here he was interrupted by an article\nof the second course, that seemed to give him great disturbance. This\nwas a roasted leveret, very strong of the fumet, which happened to be\nplaced directly under his nose. His sense of smelling was no sooner\nencountered by the effluvia of this delicious fare, than he started up\nfrom table, exclaiming, “Odd’s my liver! here’s a piece of carrion,\nthat I would not offer to e’er a hound in my kennel; ’tis enough to\nmake any Christian vomit both gut and gall;” and indeed by the wry\nfaces he made while he ran to the door, his stomach seemed ready to\njustify this last assertion."

  "content": "The abbe, who concluded, from these symptoms of disgust, that the\nleveret was not sufficiently stale, began to exhibit marks of\ndiscontent, and desired that it might be brought to the other end of\nthe table for his examination. He accordingly hung over it with the\nmost greedy appetite, feasting his nostrils with the steams of animal\nputrefaction; and at length declared that the morceau was passable,\nthough he owned it would have been highly perfect, had it been kept\nanother week. Nevertheless, mouths were not wanting to discuss it,\ninsipid as it was; for in three minutes there was not a vestige to be\nseen of that which had offended the organs of Sir Stentor, who now\nresumed his place, and did justice to the dessert. But what he seemed\nto relish better than any other part of the entertainment, was the\nconversation of our adventurer, whom, after dinner, he begged to have\nthe honour of treating with a dish of coffee, to the seeming\nmortification of his brother knight, over which Fathom exulted in his\nown heart.In short, our hero, by his affability and engaging deportment,\nimmediately gained possession of Sir Stentor’s good graces, insomuch,\nthat he desired to crack a bottle with him in the evening, and they\nrepaired to an auberge, whither his fellow-knight accompanied him, not\nwithout manifest signs of reluctance. There the stranger gave a loose\nto jollity; though at first he d—-ed the burgundy as a poor thin\nliquor, that ran through him in a twinkling, and, instead of warming,\ncooled his heart and bowels. However, it insensibly seemed to give the\nlie to his imputation; for his spirits rose to a more elevated pitch of\nmirth and good-fellowship; he sung, or rather roared, the Early Horn,\nso as to alarm the whole neighbourhood, and began to slabber his\ncompanions with a most bear-like affection. Yet whatever haste he made\nto the goal of ebriety, he was distanced by his brother baronet, who\nfrom the beginning of the party had made little other use of his mouth\nthan to receive the glass, and now sunk down upon the floor, in a state\nof temporary annihilation.He was immediately carried to bed by the direction of Ferdinand, who\nnow saw himself in a manner possessor of that mine to which he had made\nsuch eager and artful advances. That he might, therefore, carry on the\napproaches in the same cautious manner, he gradually shook off the\ntrammels of sobriety, gave a loose to that spirit of freedom which good\nliquor commonly inspires, and, in the familiarity of drunkenness, owned\nhimself head of a noble family of Poland, from which he had been\nobliged to absent himself on account of an affair of honour, not yet\ncompromised."

  "content": "Having made this confession, and laid strong injunctions of secrecy\nupon Sir Stentor, his countenance seemed to acquire from every\nsucceeding glass a new symptom of intoxication. They renewed their\nembraces, swore eternal friendship from that day, and swallowed fresh\nbumpers, till both being in all appearance quite overpowered, they\nbegan to yawn in concert, and even nod in their chairs. The knight\nseemed to resent the attacks of slumber, as so many impertinent\nattempts to interrupt their entertainment; he cursed his own propensity\nto sleep, imputing it to the d—-ed French climate, and proposed to\nengage in some pastime that would keep them awake. “Odd’s flesh!” cried\nthe Briton, “when I’m at home, I defy all the devils in hell to fasten\nmy eyelids together, if so be as I’m otherwise inclined. For there’s\nmother and sister Nan, and brother Numps and I, continue to divert\nourselves at all-fours, brag, cribbage, tetotum, husslecap, and\nchuck-varthing, and, thof I say it, that should n’t say it, I won’t\nturn my back to e’er a he in England, at any of these pastimes. And so,\nCount, if you are so disposed, I am your man, that is, in the way of\nfriendship, at which of these you shall please to pitch upon.”To this proposal Fathom replied, he was quite ignorant of all the games\nhe had mentioned; but, in order to amuse Sir Stentor, he would play\nwith him at lansquenet, for a trifle, as he had laid it down for a\nmaxim, to risk nothing considerable at play. “Waunds!” answered the\nknight, “I hope you don’t think I come here in quest of money. Thank\nGod! I have a good landed estate worth five thousand a year, and owe no\nman a halfpenny; and I question whether there be many counts in your\nnation—no offence, I hope—that can say a bolder word. As for your\nlambskin net, I know nothing of the matter; but I will toss up with you\nfor a guinea, cross or pile, as the saying is; or, if there’s such a\nthing in this country as a box and dice, I love to hear the bones\nrattle sometimes.”Fathom found some difficulty in concealing his joy at the mention of\nthis last amusement, which had been one of his chief studies, and in\nwhich he had made such progress, that he could calculate all the\nchances with the utmost exactness and certainty. However, he made shift\nto contain himself within due bounds, and, with seeming indifference,\nconsented to pass away an hour at hazard, provided the implements could\nbe procured. Accordingly, the landlord was consulted, and their desire\ngratified; the dice were produced, and the table resounded with the\neffects of their mutual eagerness. Fortune, at first, declared for the\nEnglishman, who was permitted by our adventurer to win twenty broad\npieces; and he was so elated with his success, as to accompany every\nlucky throw with a loud burst of laughter, and other savage and simple\nmanifestations of excessive joy, exclaiming, in a tone something less\nsweet than the bellowing of a bull, “Now for the main, Count,—odd! here\nthey come—here are the seven black stars, i’faith. Come along, my\nyellow boys—odd’s heart! I never liked the face of Lewis before.”"

Then he altered his note, and became\nas intemperate in his chagrin, as he had been before immoderate in his\nmirth. He cursed himself and his whole generation, d—-ed his bad luck,\nstamped with his feet upon the floor, and challenged Ferdinand to\ndouble stakes. This was a very welcome proposal to our hero, who found\nSir Stentor just such a subject as he had long desired to encounter\nwith; the more the Englishman laid, the more he lost, and Fathom took\ncare to inflame his passions, by certain well-timed sarcasms upon his\nwant of judgment, till at length he became quite outrageous, swore the\ndice were false, and threw them out at the window; pulled off his\nperiwig, and committed it to the flames, spoke with the most rancorous\ncontempt of his adversary’s skill, insisted upon his having stripped\nmany a better man, for all he was a Count, and threatening that, before\nthey parted, he should not only look like a Pole, but also smell like a\npole-cat.This was a spirit which our adventurer industriously kept up, observing\nthat the English were dupes to all the world; and that, in point of\ngenius and address, they were no more than noisy braggadocios. In\nshort, another pair of dice was procured, the stakes were again raised,\nand, after several vicissitudes, fortune declared so much in favour of\nthe knight, that Fathom lost all the money in his pocket, amounting to\na pretty considerable sum. By this time he was warmed into uncommon\neagerness and impatience; being equally piqued at the success and\nprovoking exultations of his antagonist, whom he now invited to his\nlodgings, in order to decide the contest. Sir Stentor complied with\nthis request; the dispute was renewed with various success, till,\ntowards daylight, Ferdinand saw this noisy, raw, inexperienced\nsimpleton, carry off all his ready cash, together with his jewels, and\nalmost everything that was valuable about his person; and, to crown the\nwhole, the victor at parting told him with a most intolerable sneer,\nthat as soon as the Count should receive another remittance from\nPoland, he would give him his revenge.CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVEHE BEARS HIS FATE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER; AND CONTRACTS ACQUAINTANCE WITH A\nVERY REMARKABLE PERSONAGE."

While he continued in this situation, he not only\nimproved his taste and execution in music, but likewise found frequent\nopportunities to extend his knowledge of mankind; for, besides the\nemployment he exercised in public, he was often concerned in private\nconcerts that were given in the hotels of noblemen; by which means he\nbecame more and more acquainted with the persons, manners, and\ncharacters of high life, which he contemplated with the most\nindustrious attention, as a spectator, who, being altogether\nunconcerned in the performance, is at more liberty to observe and enjoy\nthe particulars of the entertainment."

He\nwas accompanied by his brother knight and the abbe; and this\ntriumvirate, even in Fathom’s hearing, gave a most ludicrous detail of\nthe finesse they had practised upon the Polish Count, to their\nentertainer, who was ambassador from a certain court, and made himself\nextremely merry with the particulars of the relation. Indeed, they made\nshift to describe some of the circumstances in such a ridiculous light,\nthat our adventurer himself, smarting as he was with the disgrace,\ncould not help laughing in secret at the account. He afterwards made it\nhis business to inquire into the characters of the two British knights,\nand understood they were notorious sharpers, who had come abroad for\nthe good of their country, and now hunted in couple among a French\npack, that dispersed themselves through the public ordinaries, walks,\nand spectacles, in order to make a prey of incautious strangers.The pride of Ferdinand was piqued at this information; and he was even\nanimated with the desire of making reprisals upon this fraternity, from\nwhich he ardently longed to retrieve his honour and effects. But the\nissue of his last adventure had reinforced his caution; and, for the\npresent, he found means to suppress the dictates of his avarice and\nambition; resolving to employ his whole penetration in reconnoitring\nthe ground, before he should venture to take the field again. He\ntherefore continued to act the part of a one-eyed fiddler, under the\nname of Fadini, and lived with incredible frugality, that he might save\na purse for his future operations. In this manner had he proceeded for\nthe space of ten months, during which he acquired a competent knowledge\nof the city of Paris, when his curiosity was attracted by certain\npeculiarities in the appearance of a man who lived in one of the upper\napartments belonging to the house in which he himself had fixed his\nhabitation."

He seemed to be about the age of fifty, wore the Persian habit,\nand there was a remarkable severity in his aspect and demeanour. He and\nour adventurer had been fellow-lodgers for some time, and, according to\nthe laudable custom in these days, had hitherto remained as much\nestranged to one another, as if they had lived on opposite sides of the\nglobe; but of late the Persian seemed to regard our hero with\nparticular attention; when they chanced to meet on the staircase, or\nelsewhere, he bowed to Ferdinand with great solemnity, and complimented\nhim with the pas. He even proceeded, in the course of this\ncommunication, to open his mouth, and salute him with a good-morrow,\nand sometimes made the common remarks upon the weather. Fathom, who was\nnaturally complaisant, did not discourage these advances. On the\ncontrary, he behaved to him with marks of particular respect, and one\nday desired the favour of his company to breakfast.This invitation the stranger declined with due acknowledgment, on\npretence of being out of order; and, in the meantime, our adventurer\nbethought himself of questioning the landlord concerning his outlandish\nguest. His curiosity was rather inflamed than satisfied with the\ninformation he could obtain from this quarter; for all he learned was,\nthat the Persian went by the name of Ali Beker, and that he had lived\nin the house for the space of four months, in a most solitary and\nparsimonious manner, without being visited by one living soul; that,\nfor some time after his arrival, he had been often heard to groan\ndismally in the night, and even to exclaim in an unknown language, as\nif he had laboured under some grievous affliction; and though the first\ntransports of his grief had subsided, it was easy to perceive he still\nindulged a deep-rooted melancholy; for the tears were frequently\nobserved to trickle down his beard. The commissaire of the quarter had\nat first ordered this Oriental to be watched in his outgoings,\naccording to the maxims of the French police; but his life was found so\nregular and inoffensive, that this precaution was soon set aside."

His\ncuriosity, therefore, joined with the hopes of converting the\nconfidence of Ali to his own emolument, effectually impelled him\ntowards his acquaintance; and, in a little time, they began to relish\nthe conversation of each other. For, as the reader may have already\nobserved, Fathom possessed all the arts of insinuation, and had\ndiscernment enough to perceive an air of dignity in the Persian, which\nthe humility of his circumstances could not conceal. He was, moreover,\na man of good understanding, not without a tincture of letters,\nperfectly well bred, though in a ceremonious style, extremely moral in\nhis discourse, and scrupulously nice in his notions of honour.Our hero conformed himself in all respects to the other’s opinions, and\nmanaged his discretion so as to pass upon him for a gentleman reduced\nby misfortunes to the exercise of an employment which was altogether\nunsuitable to his birth and quality. He made earnest and repeated\ntenders of his good offices to the stranger, and pressed him to make\nuse of his purse with such cordial perseverance, that, at length, Ali’s\nreserve was overcome, and he condescended to borrow of him a small sum,\nwhich in all probability, saved his life; for he had been driven to the\nutmost extremity of want before he would accept of this assistance.Fathom, having gradually stole into his good graces, began to take\nnotice of many piteous sighs that escaped him in the moments of their\nintercourse, and seemed to denote an heart fraught with woe; and, on\npretence of administering consolation and counsel, begged leave to know\nthe cause of his distress, observing, that his mind would be\ndisburdened by such communication, and, perhaps, his grief alleviated\nby some means which they might jointly concert and execute in his\nbehalf.Ali, thus solicited, would often shake his head, with marks of extreme\nsorrow and despondence, and, while the tears gushed from his eyes,\ndeclared that his distress was beyond the power of any remedy but\ndeath, and that, by making our hero his confidant, he should only\nextend his unhappiness to a friend, without feeling the least remission\nof his own torture. Notwithstanding these repeated declarations,\nFerdinand, who was well enough acquainted with the mind of man to know\nthat such importunity is seldom or never disagreeable, redoubled his\ninstances, together with his expressions of sympathy and esteem, until\nthe stranger was prevailed upon to gratify his curiosity and\nbenevolence. Having, therefore, secured the chamber door one night,\nwhile all the rest of the family were asleep, the unfortunate Ali\ndisclosed himself in these words.CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX"

I have felt your friendship,\nam confident of your honour, and though my misfortunes are such as can\nnever be repaired, because I am utterly cut off from hope, which is the\nwretch’s last comfort, yet I may, by your means, be enabled to bear\nthem with some degree of fortitude and resignation.Know then, my name is not Ali; neither am I of Persian extraction. I\nhad once the honour to own myself a Castilian, and was, under the\nappellation of Don Diego de Zelos, respected as the head of one of the\nmost ancient families of that kingdom. Judge, then, how severe that\ndistress must be, which compels a Spaniard to renounce his country, his\nhonours, and his name. My youth was not spent in inglorious ease,\nneither did it waste unheeded in the rolls of fame. Before I had\nattained the age of nineteen, I was twice wounded in battle. I once\nfortunately recovered the standard of the regiment to which I belonged,\nafter it had been seized by the enemy; and, at another occasion, made\nshift to save the life of my colonel, when he lay at the mercy of an\nenraged barbarian."

  "content": "He that thinks I recapitulate these particulars out of ostentation,\ndoes wrong to the unhappy Don Diego de Zelos, who, in having performed\nthese little acts of gallantry, thinks he has done nothing, but simply\napproved himself worthy of being called a Castilian. I mean only to do\njustice to my own character, and to make you acquainted with one of the\nmost remarkable incidents of my life. It was my fate, during my third\ncampaign, to command a troop of horse in the regiment of Don Gonzales\nOrgullo, between whom and my father a family feud had long been\nmaintained with great enmity; and that gentleman did not leave me\nwithout reason to believe he rejoiced at the opportunity of exercising\nhis resentment upon his adversary’s son; for he withheld from me that\ncountenance which my fellow-officers enjoyed, and found means to\nsubject me to divers mortifications, of which I was not at liberty to\ncomplain. These I bore in silence for some time, as part of my\nprobation in the character of a soldier; resolved, nevertheless, to\nemploy my interest at court for a removal into another corps, and to\ntake some future opportunity of explaining my sentiments to Don\nGonzales upon the injustice of his behaviour.While I animated myself with these sentiments against the\ndiscouragements I underwent, and the hard duty to which I was daily\nexposed, it was our fate to be concerned in the battle of Saragossa,\nwhere our regiment was so severely handled by the English infantry,\nthat it was forced to give ground with the loss of one half of its\nofficers and men. Don Gonzales, who acted as brigadier in another wing,\nbeing informed of our fate, and dreading the disgrace of his corps,\nwhich had never turned back to the enemy, put spurs to his horse, and,\nriding across the field at full speed, rallied our broken squadrons,\nand led us back to the charge with such intrepidity of behaviour, as\ndid not fail to inspire us all with uncommon courage and alacrity. For\nmy own part, I thought myself doubly interested to distinguish my\nvalour, not only on account of my own glory, but likewise on the\nsupposition, that, as I was acting under the eye of Gonzales, my\nconduct would be narrowly observed."

I even acquired his applause in the very\nheat of battle. When his hat was struck off, and his horse fell under\nhim, I accommodated and remounted him upon my own, and, having seized\nfor my own use another that belonged to a common trooper, attended this\nstern commander as before, and seconded him in all his repeated\nefforts; but it was impossible to withstand the numbers and impetuosity\nof the foe, and Don Gonzales having had the mortification to see his\nregiment cut in pieces, and the greatest part of the army routed, was\nfain to yield to the fortune of the day; yet he retired as became a man\nof honour and a Castilian; that is, he marched off with great\ndeliberation in the rear of the Spanish troops, and frequently faced\nabout to check the pursuit of the enemy. Indeed, this exercise of his\ncourage had well-nigh cost him his life; for, in one of those\nwheelings, he was left almost alone, and a small party of the\nPortuguese horse had actually cut off our communication with the\nretreating forces of Spain.In this dilemma, we had no other chance of saving our lives and\nliberty, than that of opening a passage sword in hand; and this was\nwhat Gonzales instantly resolved to attempt. We accordingly recommended\nour souls to God, and, charging the line abreast of one another, bore\ndown all opposition, and were in a fair way of accomplishing our\nretreat without further danger; but the gallant Orgullo, in crossing a\nditch, had the misfortune to be thrown from his horse, and was almost\nthe same instant overtaken by one of the Portuguese dragoons, whose\nsword was already suspended over his head, as he lay half stunned with\nhis fall; when I rode up, discharged a pistol in the ruffian’s brain,\nand, seating my colonel on his horse, had the good fortune to conduct\nhim to a place of safety.Here he was provided with such accommodation as his case required; for\nhe had been wounded in the battle, and dangerously bruised by his fall,\nand, when all the necessary steps were taken towards his recovery, I\ndesired to know if he had any further commands for his service, being\nresolved to join the army without delay. I thought proper to\ncommunicate this question by message, because he had not spoke one word\nto me during our retreat, notwithstanding the good office he had\nreceived at my hands; a reserve which I attributed to his pride, and\nresented accordingly. He no sooner understood my intention, than he\ndesired to see me in his apartment, and, as near as I can remember,\nspoke to this effect:—"

Yes, Don Diego, your virtue hath\ntriumphed over that enmity I bore your house, and I upbraid myself with\nthe ungenerous treatment you have suffered under my command. But it is\nnot enough for me to withdraw that rigour which it was unjust to\nexercise, and would be wicked to maintain. I must likewise atone for\nthe injuries you have sustained, and make some suitable acknowledgment\nfor that life which I have twice to-day owed to your valour and\ngenerosity. Whatever interest I have at court shall be employed in your\nbehalf; and I have other designs in your favour, which shall be\ndisclosed in due season. Meanwhile, I desire you will still add one\nobligation to the debt which I have already incurred, and carry this\nbillet in person to my Estifania, who, from the news of this fatal\noverthrow must be in despair upon my account.”So saying, he presented a letter, directed to his lady, which I\nreceived in a transport of joy, with expressions suitable to the\noccasion, and immediately set out for his country house, which happened\nto be about thirty leagues from the spot. This expedition was equally\nglorious and interesting; for my thoughts upon the road were engrossed\nby the hope of seeing Don Orgullo’s daughter and heiress Antonia, who\nwas reported to be a young lady of great beauty, and the most amiable\naccomplishments. However ridiculous it may seem for a man to conceive a\npassion for an object which he hath never beheld, certain it is, my\nsentiments were so much prepossessed by the fame of her qualifications,\nthat I must have fallen a victim to her charms, had they been much less\npowerful than they were. Notwithstanding the fatigues I had undergone\nin the field, I closed not an eye until I arrived at the gate of\nGonzales, being determined to precede the report of the battle, that\nMadame d’Orgullo might not be alarmed for the life of her husband."

I was not unacquainted with your character\nbefore this last triumph of your virtue, and have often prayed to\nHeaven for some lucky determination of that fatal quarrel which raged\nso long between the family of Gonzales and your father’s house. My\nprayers have been heard, the long-wished-for reconciliation is now\neffected, and I hope nothing will ever intervene to disturb this happy\nunion.”To this polite and affectionate declaration, I made such a reply as\nbecame a young man, whose heart overflowed with joy and benevolence,\nand desired to know how soon her answer to my commander would be ready,\nthat I might gratify his impatience with all possible despatch. After\nhaving thanked me for this fresh proof of my attachment, she begged I\nwould retire into a chamber, and repose myself from the uncommon\nfatigues I must have undergone; but, finding I persisted in the\nresolution of returning to Don Gonzales, without allowing myself the\nleast benefit of sleep, she left me engaged in conversation with an\nuncle of Don Gonzales, who lodged in the house, and gave orders that a\ncollation should be prepared in another apartment, while she retired to\nher closet, and wrote a letter to her husband.In less than an hour from my first arrival, I was introduced into a\nmost elegant dining-room, where a magnificent entertainment was served\nup, and where we were joined by Donna Estifania, and her beautiful\ndaughter the fair Antonia, who, advancing with the most amiable\nsweetness, thanked me in very warm expressions of acknowledgment, for\nthe generosity of my conduct towards her father. I had been ravished\nwith her first appearance, which far exceeded my imagination, and my\nfaculties were so disordered by this address, that I answered her\ncompliment with the most awkward confusion. But this disorder did not\nturn to my prejudice in the opinion of that lovely creature, who has\noften told me in the sequel, that she gave herself credit for that\nperplexity in my behaviour, and that I never appeared more worthy of\nher regard and affection than at that juncture, when my dress was\ndiscomposed, and my whole person disfigured by the toils and duty of\nthe preceding day; for this very dishabille presented itself to her\nreflection as the immediate effect of that very merit by which I was\nentitled to her esteem."

Forgive these\ntears; they are not the drops of weakness, but remorse. Not to trouble\nyou with idle particulars, suffice it is to say, I was favoured with\nsuch marks of distinction by Madame d’Orgullo, that she thought it\nincumbent upon her to let me know she had not overacted her\nhospitality, and, while we sat at table, accosted me in these words:\n“You will not be surprised, Don Diego, at my expressions of regard,\nwhich I own are unusual from a Spanish lady to a young cavalier like\nyou, when I communicate the contents of this letter from Don Gonzales.”\nSo saying, she put the billet into my hand, and I read these words, or\nwords to this effect:—“AMIABLE ESTIFANIA,—You will understand that I am as well as a person\ncan possibly be who hath this day lived to see the army of his king\ndefeated. If you would know the particulars of this unfortunate action,\nyour curiosity will be gratified by the bearer, Don Diego de Zelos, to\nwhose virtue and bravery I am twice indebted for my life. I therefore\ndesire you will receive him with that respect and gratitude which you\nshall think due for such an obligation; and, in entertaining him,\ndismiss that reserve which often disgraces the Spanish hospitality. In\na word, let your own virtue and beneficence conduct you upon this\noccasion, and let my Antonia’s endeavours be joined with your own in\ndoing honour to the preserver of her father! Adieu.”Such a testimonial could not fail of being very agreeable to a young\nsoldier, who by this time had begun to indulge the transporting hope of\nbeing happy in the arms of the adorable Antonia. I professed myself\nextremely happy in having met with an opportunity of acquiring such a\ndegree of my colonel’s esteem, entertained them with a detail of his\npersonal prowess in the battle, and answered all their questions with\nthat moderation which every man ought to preserve in speaking of his\nown behaviour. Our repast being ended, I took my leave of the ladies,\nand at parting received a letter from Donna Estifania to her husband,\ntogether with a ring of great value, which she begged I would accept,\nas a token of her esteem. Thus loaded with honour and caresses, I set\nout on my return for the quarters of Don Gonzales, who could scarce\ncredit his own eyes when I delivered his lady’s billet; for he thought\nit impossible to perform such a journey in so short a time."

I hope Estifania has not been deficient in her duty?” I\nanswered this question, by assuring him my entertainment had been so\nagreeable in all respects, that nothing but my duty to him could have\ninduced me to give it up so soon. He then turned the conversation upon\nAntonia, and hinted his intention of giving her in marriage to a young\ncavalier, for whom he had a particular friendship. I was so much\naffected by this insinuation, which seemed at once to blast all my\nhopes of love and happiness, that the blood forsook my face; I was\nseized with an universal trepidation, and even obliged to retire, on\npretence of being suddenly taken ill.Though Gonzales seemed to impute this disorder to fatigue and want of\nrest, he in his heart ascribed it to the true cause; and, after having\nsounded my sentiments to his own satisfaction, blessed me with a\ndeclaration, importing, that I was the person upon whom he had pitched\nfor a son-in-law. I will not trouble you with a repetition of what\npassed on this interesting occasion, but proceed to observe, that his\nintention in my favour was far from being disagreeable to his lady; and\nthat, in a little time, I had the good fortune to espouse the charming\nAntonia, who submitted to the will of her father without reluctance.Soon after this happy event, I was, by the influence of Don Gonzales,\njoined to my own interest, promoted to the command of a regiment, and\nserved with honour during the remaining part of the war. After the\ntreaty of Utrecht, I was employed in reducing the Catalans to their\nallegiance; and, in an action with those obstinate rebels had the\nmisfortune to lose my father-in-law, who by that time was preferred to\nthe rank of a major-general. The virtuous Estifania did not long\nsurvive this melancholy accident; and the loss of these indulgent\nparents made such a deep impression upon the tender heart of my\nAntonia, that I took the first opportunity of removing her from a place\nin which every object served to cherish her grief, to a pleasant villa\nnear the city of Seville, which I purchased on account of its agreeable\nsituation. That I might the more perfectly enjoy the possession of my\namiable partner, who could no longer brook the thoughts of another\nseparation, peace was no sooner re-established than I obtained leave to\nresign my commission, and I wholly devoted myself to the joys of a\ndomestic life."
