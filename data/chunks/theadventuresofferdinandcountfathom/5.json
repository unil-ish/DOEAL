  "content": "To each person he replied in a polite, though mysterious manner, which\ndid not fail to enhance their opinion of his good breeding and\nimportance; and, long before the dessert appeared, he was by all the\ncompany supposed to be a personage of great consequence, who for some\nsubstantial reasons, found it convenient to keep himself incognito.\nThis being the case, it is not to be doubted that particular civilities\nwere poured upon him from all quarters. He perceived their sentiments,\nand encouraged them, by behaving with that sort of complaisance which\nseems to be the result of engaging condescension in a character of\nsuperior dignity and station. His affability was general but his chief\nattention limited to those gentlemen already mentioned, who chanced to\nsit nearest him at table; and he no sooner gave them to understand that\nhe was an utter stranger in Paris, than they unanimously begged to have\nthe honour of making him acquainted with the different curiosities\npeculiar to that metropolis.He accepted of their hospitality, accompanied them to a coffee-house in\nthe afternoon, from whence they repaired to the opera, and afterwards\nadjourned to a noted hotel, in order to spend the remaining part of the\nevening. It was here that our hero secured himself effectually in the\nfooting he had gained in their good graces. He in a moment saw through\nall the characters of the party, and adapted himself to the humour of\neach individual, without descending from that elevation of behaviour\nwhich he perceived would operate among them in his behalf. With the\nItalian he discoursed on music, in the style of a connoisseur; and\nindeed had a better claim to that title than the generality of those\nupon whom it is usually conferred; for he understood the art in theory\nas well as in practice, and would have made no contemptible figure\namong the best performers of the age."

  "content": "He harangued upon taste and genius to the abbe, who was a wit and\ncritic, ex officio, or rather ex vestitu for a young pert Frenchman,\nthe very moment he puts on the petit collet, or little band, looks upon\nhimself as an inspired son of Apollo; and every one of the fraternity\nthinks it incumbent upon him to assert the divinity of his mission. In\na word, the abbes are a set of people that bear a strong analogy to the\ntemplars in London. Fools of each fabric, sharpers of all sorts, and\ndunces of every degree, profess themselves of both orders. The templar\nis, generally speaking, a prig, so is the abbe: both are distinguished\nby an air of petulance and self-conceit, which holds a middle rank\nbetwixt the insolence of a first-rate buck and the learned pride of a\nsupercilious pedant. The abbe is supposed to be a younger brother in\nquest of preferment in the church—the Temple is considered as a\nreceptacle or seminary for younger sons intended for the bar; but a\ngreat number of each profession turn aside into other paths of life,\nlong before they reach these proposed goals. An abbe is often\nmetamorphosed into a foot soldier; a templar sometimes sinks into an\nattorney’s clerk. The galleys of France abound with abbes; and many\ntemplars may be found in our American plantations; not to mention those\nwho have made a public exit nearer home. Yet I would not have it\nthought that my description includes every individual of those\nsocieties. Some of the greatest scholars, politicians, and wits, that\never Europe produced, have worn the habit of an abbe; and many of our\nmost noble families in England derive their honours from those who have\nstudied law in the Temple. The worthy sons of every community shall\nalways be sacred from my censure and ridicule; and, while I laugh at\nthe folly of particular members, I can still honour and revere the\ninstitution.But let us return from this comparison, which some readers may think\nimpertinent and unseasonable, and observe, that the Westphalian count,\nDutch officer, and English knight, were not excepted from the\nparticular regard and attention of our adventurer. He pledged the\nGerman in every bumper; flattered the Hollander with compliments upon\nthe industry, wealth, and policy of the Seven United Provinces; but he\nreserved his chief battery for his own countryman, on the supposition\nthat he was, in all respects, the best adapted for the purposes of a\nneedy gamester. Him, therefore, he cultivated with extraordinary care\nand singular observance; for he soon perceived him to be a humourist,\nand, from that circumstance, derived an happy presage of his own\nsuccess. The baronet’s disposition seemed to be cast in the true\nEnglish mould. He was sour, silent, and contemptuous; his very looks\nindicated a consciousness of superior wealth; and he never opened his\nmouth, except to make some dry, sarcastic, national reflection. Nor was\nhis behaviour free from that air of suspicion which a man puts on when\nhe believes himself in a crowd of pick-pockets, whom his caution and\nvigilance set at defiance. In a word, though his tongue was silent on\nthe subject, his whole demeanour was continually saying, “You are all a\npack of poor lousy rascals, who have a design upon my purse. ’Tis true,\nI could buy your whole generation, but I won’t be bubbled, d’ye see; I\nam aware of your flattery, and upon my guard against all your knavish\npranks; and I come into your company for my own amusement only.”"

  "content": "Fathom having reconnoitred this peculiarity of temper, instead of\ntreating him with that assiduous complaisance, which he received from\nthe other gentlemen of the party, kept aloof from him in the\nconversation, with a remarkable shyness of distant civility, and seldom\ntook notice of what he said, except with a view to contradict him, or\nretort some of his satirical observations. This he conceived to be the\nbest method of acquiring his good opinion; because the Englishman would\nnaturally conclude he was a person who could have no sinister views\nupon his fortune, else he would have chosen quite a different manner of\ndeportment. Accordingly, the knight seemed to bite at the hook. He\nlistened to Ferdinand with uncommon regard; he was even heard to\ncommend his remarks, and at length drank to their better acquaintance.CHAPTER TWENTY-THREEACQUITS HIMSELF WITH ADDRESS IN A NOCTURNAL RIOT.The Italian and the abbe were the first who began to grow whimsical\nunder the influence of the burgundy; and, in the heat of their\nelevation, proposed that the company should amuse themselves during the\nremaining part of the night, at the house of an obliging dame, who\nmaintained a troop of fair nymphs for the accommodation of the other\nsex. The proposal was approved by all, except the Hollander, whose\neconomy the wine had not as yet invaded; and, while he retreated\nsoberly to his own lodgings, the rest of the society adjourned in two\ncoaches to the temple of love, where they were received by the\nvenerable priestess, a personage turned of seventy, who seemed to\nexercise the functions of her calling, in despite of the most cruel\nravages of time; for age had bent her into the form of a Turkish bow.\nHer head was agitated by the palsy, like the leaf of the poplar tree;\nher hair fell down in scanty parcels, as white as the driven snow; her\nface was not simply wrinkled, but ploughed into innumerable furrows;\nher jaws could not boast of one remaining tooth; one eye distilled a\nlarge quantity of rheum, by virtue of the fiery edge that surrounded\nit; the other was altogether extinguished, and she had lost her nose in\nthe course of her ministration. The Delphic sibyl was but a type of\nthis hoary matron, who, by her figure, might have been mistaken for the\nconsort of Chaos, or mother of Time. Yet there was something\nmeritorious in her appearance, as it denoted her an indefatigable\nminister to the pleasure of mankind, and as it formed an agreeable\ncontrast with the beauty and youth of the fair damsels that wantoned in\nher train. It resembled those discords in music, which, properly\ndisposed, contribute to the harmony of the whole piece; or those\nhorrible giants, who, in the world of romance, used to guard the gates\nof the castle in which the enchanted damsel was confined."

  "content": "This Urganda seemed to be aware of her own importance, and perfectly\nwell acquainted with the human appetite; for she compelled the whole\ncompany to undergo her embrace. Then a lacquey, in magnificent livery,\nushered them into a superb apartment, where they waited some minutes,\nwithout being favoured with the appearance of the ladies, to the\nmanifest dissatisfaction of the abbe, who, sending for the gouvernante,\nreprimanded her severely for her want of politesse. The old lady, who\nwas by no means a pattern of patience and submission, retorted his\nreproaches with great emphasis and vivacity. Her eloquence flowed\naltogether in the Covent Garden strain; and I question whether the\ncelebrated Mother Douglas herself could have made such a figure in an\nextemporaneous altercation.After having bestowed upon the abbe the epithets of saucy insignificant\npimp, she put him in mind of the good offices which he had received at\nher hands; how she had supplied him with bed, board, and bedfellow, in\nhis greatest necessity; sent him abroad with money in his pockets—and,\nin a word, cherished him in her bosom, when his own mother had\nabandoned him to distress. She then reviled him for presuming to\naffront her before strangers, and gave the company to understand, that\nthe young ladies would wait upon them as soon as they could be\nconfessed and receive absolution from a worthy cordelier, who was now\nemployed in performing that charitable office. The gentlemen were\nsatisfied with this remonstrance, which argued the old lady’s pious\nconcern for the souls that were under her care, and our adventurer\nproposed an accommodation betwixt her and the abbe, who was prevailed\nupon to ask her pardon, and received her blessing upon his knees.This affair had not been long adjusted, when five damsels were\nintroduced in a very gay dishabille, and our hero was complimented with\nthe privilege of choosing his Amanda from the whole bevy. When he was\nprovided, the others began to pair themselves, and, unhappily, the\nGerman count chanced to pitch upon the same nymph who had captivated\nthe desires of the British knight. A dispute immediately ensued; for\nthe Englishman made his addresses to the lady, without paying the least\nregard to the priority of the other’s claim; and she, being pleased\nwith his attachment, did not scruple to renounce his rival, who swore\nby the thunder, lightning, and sacrament, that he would not quit his\npretensions for any prince in Christendom, much less for a little\nEnglish cavalier, whom he had already honoured too much in\ncondescending to be his companion."

  "content": "The knight, provoked at this stately declaration, which was the\nimmediate effect of anger and ebriety, eyed his antagonist with a most\ncontemptuous aspect, and advised him to avoid such comparisons for the\nfuture. “We all know,” said he, “the importance of a German count; I\nsuppose your revenue amounts to three hundred rix-dollars; and you have\na chateau that looks like the ruins of an English gaol. I will bind\nmyself to lend you a thousand pounds upon a mortgage of your estate,\n(and a bad bargain I am sure I shall have,) if I do not, in less than\ntwo months, find a yeoman of Kent, who spends more in strong ale than\nthe sum-total of your yearly income; and, were the truth known, I\nbelieve that lace upon your coat is no better than tinsel, and those\nfringed ruffles, with fine Holland sleeves, tacked to a shirt of brown\ncanvas, so that, were you to undress yourself before the lady, you\nwould only expose your own poverty and pride.”The count was so much enraged at these sarcastic observations, that his\nfaculty of speech was overwhelmed by his resentment; though, in order\nto acquit himself of the Englishman’s imputation, he forthwith pulled\noff his clothes with such fury, that his brocade waistcoat was tore\nfrom top to bottom. The knight, mistaking his meaning, considered this\ndemeanour as a fair challenge, to try which was the better man in the\nexercise of boxing; and, on that supposition, began to strip in his\nturn, when he was undeceived by Fathom, who put the right\ninterpretation upon the count’s behaviour, and begged that the affair\nmight be compromised. By this time the Westphalian recovered the use of\nhis tongue, and with many threats and imprecations, desired they would\ntake notice how falsely he had been aspersed, and do him justice in\nespousing his claim to the damsel in question.Before the company had time or inclination to interest themselves in\nthe quarrel, his opponent observed that no person who was not a mere\nGerman, would ever dream of forcing the inclinations of a pretty girl,\nwhom the accidents of fortune had subjected to his power; that such\ncompulsion was equivalent to the most cruel rape that could be\ncommitted; and that the lady’s aversion was not at all surprising; for,\nto speak his own sentiments, were he a woman of pleasure, he would as\nsoon grant favours to a Westphalian hog, as to the person of his\nantagonist. The German, enraged at this comparison, was quite abandoned\nby his patience and discretion. He called the knight an English clown,\nand, swearing he was the most untoward beast of a whole nation of\nmules, snatched up one of the candlesticks, which he launched at him\nwith such force and violence, that it sung through the air, and,\nwinging its flight into the ante-chamber, encountered the skull of his\nown valet, who with immediate prostration received the message of his\nmaster."

  "content": "The knight, that he might not be behindhand with the Westphalian in\npoint of courtesy, returned the compliment with the remaining\nchandelier, which also missed its mark, and, smiting a large mirror\nthat was fixed behind them, emitted such a crash as one might expect to\nhear if a mine were sprung beneath a manufacture of glass. Both lights\nbeing thus extinguished, a furious combat ensued in the dark; the\nItalian scampered off with infinite agility, and, as he went\ndownstairs, desired that nobody would interpose, because it was an\naffair of honour, which could not be made up. The ladies consulted\ntheir safety in flight; Count Fathom slyly retired to one corner of the\nroom; while the abbe, having upon him the terrors of the commissaire,\nendeavoured to appease and part the combatants, and, in the attempt,\nsustained a random blow upon his nose, which sent him howling into the\nother chamber, where, finding his band besmeared with his own blood, he\nbegan to caper about the apartment, in a transport of rage and\nvexation.Meanwhile, the old gentlewoman being alarmed with the noise of the\nbattle, and apprehensive that it would end in murder, to the danger and\ndiscredit of herself and family, immediately mustered up her myrmidons,\nof whom she always retained a formidable band, and, putting herself at\ntheir head, lighted them to the scene of uproar. Ferdinand, who had\nhitherto observed a strict neutrality, no sooner perceived them\napproach, than he leaped in between the disputants, that he might be\nfound acting in the character of a peacemaker; and, indeed, by this\ntime, victory had declared for the baronet, who had treated his\nantagonist with a cross-buttock, which laid him almost breathless on\nthe floor. The victor was prevailed upon, by the entreaties of Fathom,\nto quit the field of battle, and adjourn into another room, where, in\nless than half an hour, he received a billet from the count, defying\nhim to single combat on the frontiers of Flanders, at an appointed time\nand place. The challenge was immediately accepted by the knight, who,\nbeing flushed with conquest, treated his adversary with great contempt.But, next day, when the fumes of the burgundy were quite exhaled, and\nthe adventure recurred to his remembrance and sober reflection, he\nwaited upon our adventurer at his lodgings, and solicited his advice in\nsuch a manner, as gave him to understand that he looked upon what had\nhappened as a drunken brawl, which ought to have no serious\nconsequences. Fathom foreseeing that the affair might be managed for\nhis own interest, professed himself of the baronet’s opinion; and,\nwithout hesitation, undertook the office of a mediator, assuring his\nprincipal, that his honour should suffer no stain in the course of his\nnegotiation."

  "content": "Having received the Englishman’s acknowledgments for this instance of\nfriendship, he forthwith set out for the place of the German’s\nhabitation, and understanding he was still asleep, insisted upon his\nbeing immediately waked, and told, that a gentleman from the chevalier\ndesired to see him, upon business of importance which could not be\ndelayed. Accordingly, his valet-de-chambre, pressed by Fathom’s\nimportunities and remonstrances, ventured to go in and shake the count\nby the shoulder; when this furious Teutonian, still agitated by the\nfever of the preceding night, leaped out of bed in a frenzy, and\nseizing his sword that lay upon a table, would have severely punished\nthe presumption of his servant, had not he been restrained by the\nentrance of Ferdinand, who, with a peremptory countenance, gave him to\nunderstand that the valet had acted at his immediate instigation; and\nthat he was come, as the Englishman’s friend, to concert with him\nproper measures for keeping the appointment they had made at their last\nmeeting.This message effectually calmed the German, who was not a little\nmortified to find himself so disagreeably disturbed. He could not help\ncursing the impatience of his antagonist, and even hinting that he\nwould have acted more like a gentleman and good Christian, in\nexpressing a desire of seeing the affair accommodated, as he knew\nhimself to be the aggressor, consequently the first offender against\nthe laws of politeness and good-fellowship. Fathom, finding him in a\nfit temper of mind, took the opportunity of assenting to the\nreasonableness of his observation. He ventured to condemn the\nimpetuosity of the baronet, who, he perceived, was extremely nice and\nscrupulous in the punctilios of honour; and said it was a pity that two\ngentlemen should forfeit each other’s friendship, much less expose\ntheir lives, for such a frivolous cause. “My dear count,” cried the\nWestphalian, “I am charmed to find your sentiments so conformable to my\nown. In an honourable cause, I despise all danger; my courage, thank\nHeaven! has been manifested in many public engagements as well as in\nprivate rencounters; but, to break with my friend, whose eminent\nvirtues I admire, and even to seek his life, on such a scandalous\noccasion, for a little insignificant w—-e, who, I suppose, took the\nadvantage of our intoxication, to foment the quarrel: by Heaven! my\nconscience cannot digest it.”"

  "content": "Having expressed himself to this purpose, he waited impatiently for the\nreply of Ferdinand, who, after a pause of deliberation, offered his\nservices in the way of mediation; though, he observed, it was a matter\nof great delicacy, and the event altogether uncertain. “Nevertheless,”\nadded our adventurer, “I will strive to appease the knight, who, I\nhope, will be induced by my remonstrances to forget the unlucky\naccident, which hath so disagreeably interrupted your mutual\nfriendship.” The German thanked him for this proof of his regard, which\nyielded him more satisfaction on account of the chevalier than of\nhimself. “For, by the tombs of my fathers,” cried he, “I have so little\nconcern for my personal safety, that, if my honour were interested, I\ndurst oppose myself singly to the whole ban of the empire; and I am now\nready, if the chevalier requires it, to give him the rendezvous in the\nforest of Senlis, either on horseback or on foot, where this contest\nmay be terminated with the life of one or both of us.”Count Fathom, with a view to chastise the Westphalian for this\nrhodomontade, told him, with a mortifying air of indifference, that if\nthey were both bent upon taking the field, he would save himself the\ntrouble of interposing farther in the affair; and desired to know the\nhour at which it would suit him to take the air with the baronet. The\nother, not a little embarrassed by this question, said, with a\nfaltering tongue, he should be proud to obey the chevalier’s orders;\nbut, at the same time, owned he should be much better pleased if our\nhero would execute the pacific proposal he had made. Fathom accordingly\npromised to exert himself for that purpose, and returned to the knight,\nwith whom he assumed the merit of having tranquillised the rage of an\nincensed barbarian, who was now disposed to a reconciliation upon equal\nterms. The baronet overwhelmed him with caresses and compliments upon\nhis friendship and address; the parties met that same forenoon, as if\nby accident, in Fathom’s apartment, where they embraced each other\ncordially, exchanged apologies, and renewed their former\ncorrespondence.Our adventurer thought he had good reason to congratulate himself upon\nthe part he had acted in this pacification. He was treated by both with\nsignal marks of particular affection and esteem. The count pressed him\nto accept, as a token of his attachment, a sword of very curious\nworkmanship, which he had received in a present from a certain prince\nof the empire. The knight forced upon his finger a very splendid\ndiamond ring, as a testimony of his gratitude and esteem. But there was\nstill another person to be appeased, before the peace of the whole\ncompany could be established. This was no other than the abbe, from\nwhom each of the reconciled friends received at dinner a billet couched\nin these words:—"

They accordingly followed his advice, and found\nthe abbe in his morning gown and slippers, with three huge nightcaps on\nhis head, and a crape hat-band tied over the middle of his face, by way\nof bandage to his nose. He received his visitors with the most\nridiculous solemnity, being still a stranger to the purport of their\nerrand; but soon as the Westphalian declared they were come in\nconsequence of his billet, in order to ask pardon for the undesigned\noffence they had given, his features retrieved their natural vivacity,\nand he professed himself perfectly satisfied with their polite\nacknowledgment. Then they condoled him upon the evil plight of his\nnose, and seeing some marks upon his shirt, asked with seeming concern,\nif he had lost any blood in the fray? To this interrogation he replied,\nthat he had still a sufficient quantity left for the occasions of his\nfriends; and that he should deem it his greatest glory to expend the\nlast drop of it in their service."

This was no other than a person\nhabited in the exact uniform of an English jockey. His leathern cap,\ncut bob, fustian frock, flannel waistcoat, buff breeches, hunting-boots\nand whip, were sufficient of themselves to furnish out a phenomenon for\nthe admiration of all Paris. But these peculiarities were rendered\nstill more conspicuous by the behaviour of the man who owned them. When\nhe crossed the threshold of the outward door, he produced such a sound\nfrom the smack of his whip, as equalled the explosion of an ordinary\ncohorn; and then broke forth into the halloo of a foxhunter, which he\nuttered with all its variations, in a strain of vociferation that\nseemed to astonish and confound the whole assembly, to whom he\nintroduced himself and his spaniel, by exclaiming, in a tone something\nless melodious than the cry of mackerel or live cod, “By your leave,\ngentlevolks, I hope there’s no offence, in an honest plain Englishman’s\ncoming with money in his pocket, to taste a bit of your Vrench frigasee\nand ragooze.”This declaration was made in such a wild, fantastical manner, that the\ngreatest part of the company mistook him for some savage monster or\nmaniac, and consulted their safety by starting up from table, and\ndrawing their swords. The Englishman, seeing such a martial apparatus\nproduced against him, recoiled two or three steps, saying, “Waunds! a\nbelieve the people are all bewitched. What, do they take me for a beast\nof prey? is there nobody here that knows Sir Stentor Stile, or can\nspeak to me in my own lingo?” He had no sooner pronounced these words,\nthan the baronet, with marks of infinite surprise, ran towards him,\ncrying, “Good Heaven! Sir Stentor, who expected to meet with you in\nParis?” Upon which, the other eyeing him very earnestly, “Odds\nheartlikins!” cried he, “my neighbour, Sir Giles Squirrel, as I am a\nliving soul!” With these words he flew upon him like a tiger, kissed\nhim from ear to ear, demolished his periwig, and disordered the whole\neconomy of his dress, to the no small entertainment of the company.Having well-nigh stifled his countryman with embraces, and besmeared\nhimself with pulville from head to foot, he proceeded in this manner,\n“Mercy upon thee, knight, thou art so transmographied, and bedaubed,\nand bedizened, that thou mought rob thy own mother without fear of\ninformation. Look ye here now, I will be trussed, if the very bitch\nthat was brought up in thy own bosom knows thee again. Hey, Sweetlips,\nhere hussy, d—n the tuoad, dos’t n’t know thy old measter?

  "content": "These compliments being passed, the two knights sat down by one\nanother, and Sir Stentor being asked by his neighbour, upon what errand\nhe had crossed the sea, gave him to understand, that he had come to\nFrance, in consequence of a wager with Squire Snaffle, who had laid a\nthousand pounds, that he, Sir Stentor, would not travel to Paris by\nhimself, and for a whole month appear every day at a certain hour in\nthe public walks, without wearing any other dress than that in which he\nsaw him. “The fellor has got no more stuff in his pate,” continued this\npolite stranger, “than a jackass, to think I could not find my way\nhither thof I could not jabber your French lingo. Ecod! the people of\nthis country are sharp enough to find out your meaning, when you want\nto spend anything among them; and, as for the matter of dress,\nbodikins! for a thousand pound, I would engage to live in the midst of\nthem, and show myself without any clothes at all. Odds heart! a\ntrue-born Englishman needs not be ashamed to show his face, nor his\nbackside neither, with the best Frenchman that ever trod the ground.\nThof we Englishmen don’t beplaister our doublets with gold and silver,\nI believe as how we have our pockets better lined than most of our\nneighbours; and for all my bit of a fustian frock, that cost me in all\nbut forty shillings, I believe, between you and me, knight, I have more\ndust in my fob, than all those powdered sparks put together. But the\nworst of the matter is this; here is no solid belly-timber in this\ncountry. One can’t have a slice of delicate sirloin, or nice buttock of\nbeef, for love nor money. A pize upon them! I could get no eatables\nupon the ruoad, but what they called bully, which looks like the flesh\nof Pharaoh’s lean kine stewed into rags and tatters; and then their\npeajohn, peajohn, rabbet them! One would think every old woman of this\nkingdom hatched pigeons from her own body.”It is not to be supposed that such an original sat unobserved. The\nFrench and other foreigners, who had never been in England, were struck\ndumb with amazement at the knight’s appearance and deportment; while\nthe English guests were overwhelmed with shame and confusion, and kept\na most wary silence, for fear of being recognised by their countryman.\nAs for our adventurer, he was inwardly transported with joy at sight of\nthis curiosity. He considered him as a genuine, rich country booby, of\nthe right English growth, fresh as imported; and his heart throbbed\nwith rapture, when he heard Sir Stentor value himself upon the lining\nof his pockets. He foresaw, indeed, that the other knight would\nendeavour to reserve him for his own game; but he was too conscious of\nhis own accomplishments to think he should find great difficulty in\nsuperseding the influence of Sir Giles."

  "content": "Meanwhile, the new-comer was by his friend helped to some ragout, which\npleased his palate so well, that he declared he should now make a\nhearty meal, for the first time since he had crossed the water; and,\nwhile his good-humour prevailed, he drank to every individual around\nthe table. Ferdinand seized this opportunity of insinuating himself\ninto his favour, by saying in English, he was glad to find there was\nanything in France that was agreeable to Sir Stentor. To this\ncompliment the knight replied with an air of surprise: “Waunds! I find\nhere’s another countryman of mine in this here company. Sir, I am proud\nto see you with all my heart.” So speaking, he thrust out his right\nhand across the table, and shook our hero by the fist, with such\nviolence of civility, as proved very grievous to a French marquis, who,\nin helping himself to soup, was jostled in such a manner, as to\noverturn the dividing-spoon in his own bosom. The Englishman, seeing\nthe mischief he had produced, cried, “No offence, I hope,” in a tone of\nvociferation, which the marquis in all probability misconstrued; for he\nbegan to model his features into a very sublime and peremptory look,\nwhen Fathom interpreted the apology, and at the same time informed Sir\nStentor, that although he himself had not the honour of being an\nEnglishman, he had always entertained a most particular veneration for\nthe country, and learned the language in consequence of that esteem.“Blood!” answered the knight, “I think myself the more obliged to you\nfor your kind opinion, than if you was my countryman in good earnest.\nFor there be abundance of we English—no offence, Sir Giles—that seem to\nbe ashamed of their own nation, and leave their homes to come and spend\ntheir fortunes abroad, among a parcel of—you understand me, sir—a word\nto the wise, as the saying is.”—Here he was interrupted by an article\nof the second course, that seemed to give him great disturbance. This\nwas a roasted leveret, very strong of the fumet, which happened to be\nplaced directly under his nose. His sense of smelling was no sooner\nencountered by the effluvia of this delicious fare, than he started up\nfrom table, exclaiming, “Odd’s my liver! here’s a piece of carrion,\nthat I would not offer to e’er a hound in my kennel; ’tis enough to\nmake any Christian vomit both gut and gall;” and indeed by the wry\nfaces he made while he ran to the door, his stomach seemed ready to\njustify this last assertion."

  "content": "The abbe, who concluded, from these symptoms of disgust, that the\nleveret was not sufficiently stale, began to exhibit marks of\ndiscontent, and desired that it might be brought to the other end of\nthe table for his examination. He accordingly hung over it with the\nmost greedy appetite, feasting his nostrils with the steams of animal\nputrefaction; and at length declared that the morceau was passable,\nthough he owned it would have been highly perfect, had it been kept\nanother week. Nevertheless, mouths were not wanting to discuss it,\ninsipid as it was; for in three minutes there was not a vestige to be\nseen of that which had offended the organs of Sir Stentor, who now\nresumed his place, and did justice to the dessert. But what he seemed\nto relish better than any other part of the entertainment, was the\nconversation of our adventurer, whom, after dinner, he begged to have\nthe honour of treating with a dish of coffee, to the seeming\nmortification of his brother knight, over which Fathom exulted in his\nown heart.In short, our hero, by his affability and engaging deportment,\nimmediately gained possession of Sir Stentor’s good graces, insomuch,\nthat he desired to crack a bottle with him in the evening, and they\nrepaired to an auberge, whither his fellow-knight accompanied him, not\nwithout manifest signs of reluctance. There the stranger gave a loose\nto jollity; though at first he d—-ed the burgundy as a poor thin\nliquor, that ran through him in a twinkling, and, instead of warming,\ncooled his heart and bowels. However, it insensibly seemed to give the\nlie to his imputation; for his spirits rose to a more elevated pitch of\nmirth and good-fellowship; he sung, or rather roared, the Early Horn,\nso as to alarm the whole neighbourhood, and began to slabber his\ncompanions with a most bear-like affection. Yet whatever haste he made\nto the goal of ebriety, he was distanced by his brother baronet, who\nfrom the beginning of the party had made little other use of his mouth\nthan to receive the glass, and now sunk down upon the floor, in a state\nof temporary annihilation.He was immediately carried to bed by the direction of Ferdinand, who\nnow saw himself in a manner possessor of that mine to which he had made\nsuch eager and artful advances. That he might, therefore, carry on the\napproaches in the same cautious manner, he gradually shook off the\ntrammels of sobriety, gave a loose to that spirit of freedom which good\nliquor commonly inspires, and, in the familiarity of drunkenness, owned\nhimself head of a noble family of Poland, from which he had been\nobliged to absent himself on account of an affair of honour, not yet\ncompromised."

  "content": "Having made this confession, and laid strong injunctions of secrecy\nupon Sir Stentor, his countenance seemed to acquire from every\nsucceeding glass a new symptom of intoxication. They renewed their\nembraces, swore eternal friendship from that day, and swallowed fresh\nbumpers, till both being in all appearance quite overpowered, they\nbegan to yawn in concert, and even nod in their chairs. The knight\nseemed to resent the attacks of slumber, as so many impertinent\nattempts to interrupt their entertainment; he cursed his own propensity\nto sleep, imputing it to the d—-ed French climate, and proposed to\nengage in some pastime that would keep them awake. “Odd’s flesh!” cried\nthe Briton, “when I’m at home, I defy all the devils in hell to fasten\nmy eyelids together, if so be as I’m otherwise inclined. For there’s\nmother and sister Nan, and brother Numps and I, continue to divert\nourselves at all-fours, brag, cribbage, tetotum, husslecap, and\nchuck-varthing, and, thof I say it, that should n’t say it, I won’t\nturn my back to e’er a he in England, at any of these pastimes. And so,\nCount, if you are so disposed, I am your man, that is, in the way of\nfriendship, at which of these you shall please to pitch upon.”To this proposal Fathom replied, he was quite ignorant of all the games\nhe had mentioned; but, in order to amuse Sir Stentor, he would play\nwith him at lansquenet, for a trifle, as he had laid it down for a\nmaxim, to risk nothing considerable at play. “Waunds!” answered the\nknight, “I hope you don’t think I come here in quest of money. Thank\nGod! I have a good landed estate worth five thousand a year, and owe no\nman a halfpenny; and I question whether there be many counts in your\nnation—no offence, I hope—that can say a bolder word. As for your\nlambskin net, I know nothing of the matter; but I will toss up with you\nfor a guinea, cross or pile, as the saying is; or, if there’s such a\nthing in this country as a box and dice, I love to hear the bones\nrattle sometimes.”Fathom found some difficulty in concealing his joy at the mention of\nthis last amusement, which had been one of his chief studies, and in\nwhich he had made such progress, that he could calculate all the\nchances with the utmost exactness and certainty. However, he made shift\nto contain himself within due bounds, and, with seeming indifference,\nconsented to pass away an hour at hazard, provided the implements could\nbe procured. Accordingly, the landlord was consulted, and their desire\ngratified; the dice were produced, and the table resounded with the\neffects of their mutual eagerness. Fortune, at first, declared for the\nEnglishman, who was permitted by our adventurer to win twenty broad\npieces; and he was so elated with his success, as to accompany every\nlucky throw with a loud burst of laughter, and other savage and simple\nmanifestations of excessive joy, exclaiming, in a tone something less\nsweet than the bellowing of a bull, “Now for the main, Count,—odd! here\nthey come—here are the seven black stars, i’faith. Come along, my\nyellow boys—odd’s heart! I never liked the face of Lewis before.”"

  "content": "Fathom drew happy presages from these boyish raptures, and, after\nhaving indulged them for some time, began to avail himself of his\narithmetic, in consequence of which the knight was obliged to refund\nthe greatest part of his winning. Then he altered his note, and became\nas intemperate in his chagrin, as he had been before immoderate in his\nmirth. He cursed himself and his whole generation, d—-ed his bad luck,\nstamped with his feet upon the floor, and challenged Ferdinand to\ndouble stakes. This was a very welcome proposal to our hero, who found\nSir Stentor just such a subject as he had long desired to encounter\nwith; the more the Englishman laid, the more he lost, and Fathom took\ncare to inflame his passions, by certain well-timed sarcasms upon his\nwant of judgment, till at length he became quite outrageous, swore the\ndice were false, and threw them out at the window; pulled off his\nperiwig, and committed it to the flames, spoke with the most rancorous\ncontempt of his adversary’s skill, insisted upon his having stripped\nmany a better man, for all he was a Count, and threatening that, before\nthey parted, he should not only look like a Pole, but also smell like a\npole-cat.This was a spirit which our adventurer industriously kept up, observing\nthat the English were dupes to all the world; and that, in point of\ngenius and address, they were no more than noisy braggadocios. In\nshort, another pair of dice was procured, the stakes were again raised,\nand, after several vicissitudes, fortune declared so much in favour of\nthe knight, that Fathom lost all the money in his pocket, amounting to\na pretty considerable sum. By this time he was warmed into uncommon\neagerness and impatience; being equally piqued at the success and\nprovoking exultations of his antagonist, whom he now invited to his\nlodgings, in order to decide the contest. Sir Stentor complied with\nthis request; the dispute was renewed with various success, till,\ntowards daylight, Ferdinand saw this noisy, raw, inexperienced\nsimpleton, carry off all his ready cash, together with his jewels, and\nalmost everything that was valuable about his person; and, to crown the\nwhole, the victor at parting told him with a most intolerable sneer,\nthat as soon as the Count should receive another remittance from\nPoland, he would give him his revenge.CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVEHE BEARS HIS FATE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER; AND CONTRACTS ACQUAINTANCE WITH A\nVERY REMARKABLE PERSONAGE."

  "content": "This was a proper subject for our hero to moralise upon; and\naccordingly it did not pass without his remarks; he found himself\nfairly foiled at his own weapons, reduced to indigence in a foreign\nland, and, what he chiefly regretted, robbed of all those gay\nexpectations he had indulged from his own supposed excellence in the\nwiles of fraud; for, upon a little recollection, he plainly perceived\nhe had fallen a sacrifice to the confederacy he had refused to join;\nand did not at all doubt that the dice were loaded for his destruction.\nBut, instead of beating his head against the wall, tearing his hair,\nimprecating vain curses upon himself, or betraying other frantic\nsymptoms of despair, he resolved to accommodate himself to his fate,\nand profit by the lesson he had so dearly bought.With this intention, he immediately dismissed his valet, quitted his\nlodgings, retired to an obscure street on the other side of the river,\nand, covering one eye with a large patch of black silk, presented\nhimself in quality of a musician to the director of the opera, who,\nupon hearing a trial of his skill, received him into the band without\nfurther question. While he continued in this situation, he not only\nimproved his taste and execution in music, but likewise found frequent\nopportunities to extend his knowledge of mankind; for, besides the\nemployment he exercised in public, he was often concerned in private\nconcerts that were given in the hotels of noblemen; by which means he\nbecame more and more acquainted with the persons, manners, and\ncharacters of high life, which he contemplated with the most\nindustrious attention, as a spectator, who, being altogether\nunconcerned in the performance, is at more liberty to observe and enjoy\nthe particulars of the entertainment."

  "content": "It was in one of those assemblies he had the pleasure of seeing his\nfriend Sir Stentor, dressed in the most fashionable manner, and\nbehaving with all the overstrained politesse of a native Frenchman. He\nwas accompanied by his brother knight and the abbe; and this\ntriumvirate, even in Fathom’s hearing, gave a most ludicrous detail of\nthe finesse they had practised upon the Polish Count, to their\nentertainer, who was ambassador from a certain court, and made himself\nextremely merry with the particulars of the relation. Indeed, they made\nshift to describe some of the circumstances in such a ridiculous light,\nthat our adventurer himself, smarting as he was with the disgrace,\ncould not help laughing in secret at the account. He afterwards made it\nhis business to inquire into the characters of the two British knights,\nand understood they were notorious sharpers, who had come abroad for\nthe good of their country, and now hunted in couple among a French\npack, that dispersed themselves through the public ordinaries, walks,\nand spectacles, in order to make a prey of incautious strangers.The pride of Ferdinand was piqued at this information; and he was even\nanimated with the desire of making reprisals upon this fraternity, from\nwhich he ardently longed to retrieve his honour and effects. But the\nissue of his last adventure had reinforced his caution; and, for the\npresent, he found means to suppress the dictates of his avarice and\nambition; resolving to employ his whole penetration in reconnoitring\nthe ground, before he should venture to take the field again. He\ntherefore continued to act the part of a one-eyed fiddler, under the\nname of Fadini, and lived with incredible frugality, that he might save\na purse for his future operations. In this manner had he proceeded for\nthe space of ten months, during which he acquired a competent knowledge\nof the city of Paris, when his curiosity was attracted by certain\npeculiarities in the appearance of a man who lived in one of the upper\napartments belonging to the house in which he himself had fixed his\nhabitation."
