He was therefore accommodated\nwith a second-hand suit and another shirt, and at once listed under the\nbanners of Count Fathom, who spent the whole afternoon in giving him\nproper instructions for the regulation of his conduct.Having settled these preliminaries to his own satisfaction, he and his\nbaggage were embarked about six o’clock in the month of September, and\nit was not without emotion that he found himself benighted upon the\ngreat deep, of which, before the preceding day, he had never enjoyed\neven the most distant prospect. However, he was not a man to be afraid,\nwhere there was really no appearance of danger; and the agreeable\npresages of future fortune supported his spirits, amidst the\ndisagreeable nausea which commonly attends landsmen at sea, until he\nwas set ashore upon the beach at Deal, which he entered in good health\nabout seven o’clock in the morning.Like Caesar, however, he found some difficulty in landing, on account\nof the swelling surf, that tumbled about with such violence as had\nalmost overset the cutter that carried him on shore; and, in his\neagerness to jump upon the strand, his foot slipped from the side of\nthe boat, so that he was thrown forwards in an horizontal direction,\nand his hands were the first parts of him that touched English ground.\nUpon this occasion, he, in imitation of Scipio’s behaviour on the coast\nof Africa, hailed the omen, and, grasping a handful of the sand, was\nheard to exclaim, in the Italian language: “Ah, ah, Old England, I have\nthee fast.”"

His first\ncare was to recompense himself for the want of sleep he had undergone,\nand, after he had sufficiently recruited himself with several hours of\nuninterrupted repose, he set out in a post-chaise for Canterbury, where\nhe took a place in the London stage, which he was told would depart\nnext morning, the coach being already full. On this very first day of\nhis arrival, he perceived between the English and the people among whom\nhe had hitherto lived, such essential difference in customs,\nappearance, and way of living, as inspired him with high notions of\nthat British freedom, opulence, and convenience, on which he had often\nheard his mother expatiate. On the road, he feasted his eyesight with\nthe verdant hills covered with flocks of sheep, the fruitful vales\nparcelled out into cultivated enclosures; the very cattle seemed to\nprofit by the wealth of their masters, being large, sturdy, and sleek,\nand every peasant breathed the insolence of liberty and independence.\nIn a word, he viewed the wide-extended plains of Kent with a lover’s\neye, and, his ambition becoming romantic, could not help fancying\nhimself another conqueror of the isle.He was not, however, long amused by these vain chimeras, which soon\nvanished before other reflections of more importance and solidity. His\nimagination, it must be owned, was at all times too chaste to admit\nthose overweening hopes, which often mislead the mind of the projector.\nHe had studied mankind with incredible diligence, and knew perfectly\nwell how far he could depend on the passions and foibles of human\nnature. That he might now act consistent with his former sagacity, he\nresolved to pass himself upon his fellow-travellers for a French\ngentleman, equally a stranger to the language and country of England,\nin order to glean from their discourse such intelligence as might avail\nhim in his future operations; and his lacquey was tutored accordingly.CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTSOME ACCOUNT OF HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLERS.Those who had taken places for the coach, understanding the sixth seat\nwas engaged by a foreigner, determined to profit by his ignorance; and,\nwith that politeness which is peculiar to this happy island, fixed\nthemselves in the vehicle, in such a manner, before he had the least\nintimation of their design, that he found it barely practicable to\ninsinuate himself sidelong between a corpulent quaker and a fat Wapping\nlandlady, in which attitude he stuck fast, like a thin quarto between\ntwo voluminous dictionaries on a bookseller’s shelf. And, as if the\npain and inconvenience of such compression was not sufficient matter of\nchagrin, the greatest part of the company entertained themselves with\nlaughing at his ludicrous station."

  "content": "The jolly dame at his left hand observed, with a loud exclamation of\nmirth, that monsieur would be soon better acquainted with a buttock of\nEnglish beef; and said, by that time they should arrive at their\ndining-place, he might be spitted without larding. “Yes, verily,”\nreplied Obadiah, who was a wag in his way, “but the swine’s fat will be\nall on one side.”—“So much the better for you,” cried mine hostess,\n“for that side is all your own.” The quaker was not so much\ndisconcerted by the quickness of this repartee, but that he answered\nwith great deliberation, “I thank thee for thy love, but will not\nprofit by thy loss, especially as I like not the savour of these\noutlandish fowls; they are profane birds of passage, relished only by\nthe children of vanity, like thee.”The plump gentlewoman took umbrage at this last expression, which she\nconsidered as a double reproach, and repeated the words, “Children of\nvanity!” with an emphasis of resentment. “I believe, if the truth were\nknown,” said she, “there’s more vanity than midriff in that great belly\nof yours, for all your pretending to humility and religion. Sirrah! my\ncorporation is made up of good, wholesome, English fat; but you are\npuffed up with the wind of vanity and delusion; and when it begins to\ngripe your entrails, you pretend to have a motion, and then get up and\npreach nonsense. Yet you’ll take it upon you to call your betters\nchildren. Marry come up, Mr. Goosecap, I have got children that are as\ngood men as you, or any hypocritical trembler in England.”A person who sat opposite to the quaker, hearing this remonstrance,\nwhich seemed pregnant with contention, interposed in the conversation\nwith a conscious leer, and begged there might be no rupture between the\nspirit and the flesh. By this remonstrance he relieved Obadiah from the\nsatire of this female orator, and brought the whole vengeance of her\nelocution upon his own head. “Flesh!” cried she, with all the ferocity\nof an enraged Thalestris; “none of your names, Mr. Yellowchaps. What! I\nwarrant you have an antipathy to flesh, because you yourself are\nnothing but skin and bone. I suppose you are some poor starved\njourneyman tailor come from France, where you have been learning to\ncabbage, and have not seen a good meal of victuals these seven years.\nYou have been living upon rye-bread and soup-maigre, and now you come\nover like a walking atomy with a rat’s tail at your wig, and a tinsey\njacket. And so, forsooth, you set up for a gentleman, and pretend to\nfind fault with a sirloin of roast beef.”"

Since when, I pray, have you travelled in\nstage-coaches, and left off your old profession of crying oysters in\nwinter, and rotten mackerel in June? You was then known by the name of\nKate Brawn, and in good repute among the ale-houses in Thames Street,\ntill that unlucky amour with the master of a corn-vessel, in which he\nwas unfortunately detected by his own spouse; but you seem to have\nrisen by that fall; and I wish you joy of your present plight. Though,\nconsidering your education on Bear Quay, you can give but a sorry\naccount of yourself.”The Amazon, though neither exhausted nor dismayed, was really\nconfounded at the temper and assurance of this antagonist, who had\ngathered all these anecdotes from the fertility of his own invention;\nafter a short pause, however, she poured forth a torrent of obloquy\nsufficient to overwhelm any person who had not been used to take up\narms against such seas of trouble; and a dispute ensued, which would\nhave not only disgraced the best orators on the Thames, but even have\nmade a figure in the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, during\nwhich the Athenian matrons rallied one another from different waggons,\nwith that freedom of altercation so happily preserved in this our age\nand country."

  "content": "Such a redundancy of epithets, and variety of metaphors, tropes, and\nfigures were uttered between these well-matched opponents, that an epic\nbard would have found his account in listening to the contest; which,\nin all probability, would not have been confined to words, had it not\nbeen interrupted for the sake of a young woman of an agreeable\ncountenance and modest carriage; who, being shocked at some of their\nflowers of speech, and terrified by the menacing looks and gestures of\nthe fiery-featured dame, began to scream aloud, and beg leave to quit\nthe coach. Her perturbation put an end to the high debate. The sixth\npassenger, who had not opened his mouth, endeavoured to comfort her\nwith assurances of protection; the quaker proposed a cessation of arms;\nthe male disputant acquiesced in the proposal, assuring the company he\nhad entered the lists for their entertainment only, without acquiring\nthe least grudge or ill-will to the fat gentlewoman, whom he protested\nhe had never seen before that day, and who, for aught he knew, was a\nperson of credit and reputation. He then held forth his hand in token\nof amity, and asked pardon of the offended party, who was appeased by\nhis submission; and, in testimony of her benevolence, presented to the\nother female, whom she had discomposed, an Hungary-water bottle filled\nwith cherry-brandy, recommending it as a much more powerful remedy than\nthe sal-volatile which the other held to her nose.Peace being thus re-established, in a treaty comprehending Obadiah and\nall present, it will not be improper to give the reader some further\ninformation, touching the several characters assembled in this vehicle.\nThe quaker was a London merchant, who had been at Deal superintending\nthe repairs of a ship which had suffered by a storm in the Downs. The\nWapping landlady was on her return from the same place, where she had\nattended the payment of a man-of-war, with sundry powers of attorney,\ngranted by the sailors, who had lived upon credit at her house. Her\ncompetitor in fame was a dealer in wine, a smuggler of French lace, and\na petty gamester just arrived from Paris, in the company of an English\nbarber, who sat on his right hand, and the young woman was daughter of\na country curate, in her way to London, where she was bound apprentice\nto a milliner.Hitherto Fathom had sat in silent astonishment at the manners of his\nfellow-travellers, which far exceeded the notions he had preconceived\nof English plainness and rusticity. He found himself a monument of that\ndisregard and contempt which a stranger never fails to meet with from\nthe inhabitants of this island; and saw, with surprise, an agreeable\nyoung creature sit as solitary and unheeded as himself.He was, indeed, allured by the roses of her complexion, and the\ninnocence of her aspect, and began to repent of having pretended\nignorance of the language, by which he was restrained from exercising\nhis eloquence upon her heart; he resolved, however, to ingratiate\nhimself, if possible, by the courtesy and politeness of dumb show, and\nfor that purpose put his eyes in motion without farther delay.CHAPTER TWENTY-NINEANOTHER PROVIDENTIAL DELIVERANCE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE SMUGGLER’S\nINGENIOUS CONJECTURE."

  "content": "During these deliberations, the wine merchant, with a view to make a\nparade of his superior parts and breeding, as well as to pave the way\nfor a match at backgammon, made a tender of his snuff-box to our\nadventurer, and asked, in bad French, how he travelled from Paris. This\nquestion produced a series of interrogations concerning the place of\nFerdinand’s abode in that city, and his business in England, so that he\nwas fain to practise the science of defence, and answered with such\nambiguity, as aroused the suspicion of the smuggler, who began to\nbelieve our hero had some very cogent reason for evading his curiosity;\nhe immediately set his reflection at work, and, after various\nconjectures, fixed upon Fathom’s being the Young Pretender. Big with\nthis supposition, he eyed him with the most earnest attention,\ncomparing his features with those of the Chevalier’s portrait which he\nhad seen in France, and though the faces were as unlike as any two\nhuman faces could be, found the resemblance so striking as to dispel\nall his doubts, and persuade him to introduce the stranger to some\njustice on the road; a step by which he would not only manifest his\nzeal for the Protestant succession, but also acquire the splendid\nreward proposed by parliament to any person who should apprehend that\nfamous adventurer.These ideas intoxicated the brain of this man to such a pitch of\nenthusiasm, that he actually believed himself in possession of the\nthirty thousand pounds, and amused his fancy with a variety of\nmagnificent projects to be executed by means of that acquisition, until\nhis reverie was interrupted by the halting of the coach at the inn\nwhere the passengers used to eat their breakfasts. Waked as he was from\nthe dream of happiness, it had made such impression upon his mind,\nthat, seeing Fathom rise up with an intention to alight, he took it for\ngranted his design was to escape, and seizing him by the collar, called\naloud for assistance in the King’s name.Our hero, whose sagacity and presence of mind very often supplied the\nplace of courage, instead of being terrified at this assault, which\nmight have disturbed the tranquillity of an ordinary villain, was so\nperfectly master of every circumstance of his own situation, as to know\nat once that the aggressor could not possibly have the least cause of\ncomplaint against him; and therefore, imputing this violence either to\nmadness or mistake, very deliberately suffered himself to be made\nprisoner by the people of the house, who ran to the coach door in\nobedience to the summons of the wine merchant. The rest of the company\nwere struck dumb with surprise and consternation at this sudden\nadventure; and the quaker, dreading some fell resistance on the side of\nthe outlandish man, unpinned the other coach door in the twinkling of\nan eye, and trundled himself into the mud for safety. The others,\nseeing the temper and resignation of the prisoner, soon recovered their\nrecollection, and began to inquire into the cause of his arrest, upon\nwhich, the captor, whose teeth chattered with terror and impatience,\ngave them to understand that he was a state criminal, and demanded\ntheir help in conveying him to justice."

In this order did the procession\nadvance to the apartment in which the magistrate, with his fellows of\nthe chase, sat smoking his morning pipe over a tankard of strong ale,\nand the smuggler being directed to the right person, “May it please\nyour worship,” said he, “I have brought this foreigner before you, on a\nviolent suspicion of his being a proclaimed outlaw; and I desire,\nbefore these witnesses, that my title may be made good to the reward\nthat shall become due upon his conviction.”“Friend,” replied the justice, “I know nothing of you or your titles;\nbut this I know, if you have any information to give in, you must come\nto my house when I am at home, and proceed in a lawful way, that is,\nd’ye mind me, if you swear as how this here person is an outlaw; then\nif so be as he has nothing to say to the contrary, my clerk shall make\nout a mittimus, and so to jail with him till next ’size.” “But, sir,”\nanswered the impeacher, “this is a case that admits of no delay; the\nperson I have apprehended is a prisoner of consequence to the state.”\n“How, fellor!” cried the magistrate, interrupting him, “is there any\nperson of more consequence than one of his Majesty’s justices of the\npeace, who is besides a considerable member of the landed interest!\nD’ye know, sirrah, who you are talking to? If you don’t go about your\nbusiness, I believe I shall lay you by the heels.”The smuggler, fearing his prize would escape through the ignorance,\npride, and obstinacy of this country justice, approached his worship,\nand in a whisper which was overheard by all the company, assured him he\nhad indubitable reason to believe the foreigner was no other than the\nPretender’s eldest son. At mention of this formidable name, every\nindividual of the audience started, with signs of terror and amazement.\nThe justice dropped his pipe, recoiled upon his chair, and, looking\nmost ridiculously aghast, exclaimed, “Seize him, in the name of God and\nhis Majesty King George! Has he got no secret arms about him!”"

This request was interpreted by the accuser,\nwho, at the same time, laid claim to the booty. The justice took charge\nof the deposit, and one of his neighbours having undertaken the office\nof clerk, he proceeded to the examination of the culprit, whose papers\nwere by this time laid on the table before him. “Stranger,” said he,\n“you stand charged with being son of the Pretender to these realms;\nwhat have you to say in your own defence?” Our hero assured him, in the\nFrench language, that he was falsely impeached, and demanded justice on\nthe accuser, who, without the least reason, had made such a malicious\nattack upon the life and honour of an innocent gentleman.The smuggler, instead of acting the part of a faithful interpreter,\ntold his worship, that the prisoner’s answer was no more than a simple\ndenial, which every felon would make who had nothing else to plead in\nhis own behalf, and that this alone was a strong presumption of his\nguilt, because, if he was not really the person they suspected him to\nbe, the thing would speak for itself, for, if he was not the Young\nPretender, who then was he? This argument had great weight with the\njustice, who, assuming a very important aspect, observed, “Very true,\nfriend, if you are not the Pretender, in the name of God, who are you?\nOne may see with half an eye that he is no better than a promiscuous\nfellow.”Ferdinand now began to repent of having pretended ignorance of the\nEnglish language, as he found himself at the mercy of a rascal, who put\na false gloss upon all his words, and addressed himself to the audience\nsuccessively in French, High Dutch, Italian, and Hungarian Latin,\ndesiring to know if any person present understood any of these tongues,\nthat his answers might be honestly explained to the bench. But he might\nhave accosted them in Chinese with the same success: there was not one\nperson present tolerably versed in his mother-tongue, much less\nacquainted with any foreign language, except the wine merchant, who,\nincensed at this appeal, which he considered as an affront to his\nintegrity, gave the judge to understand, that the delinquent, instead\nof speaking to the purpose, contumaciously insulted his authority in\nsundry foreign lingos, which he apprehended was an additional proof of\nhis being the Chevalier’s son, inasmuch as no person would take the\npains to learn such a variety of gibberish, except with some sinister\nintent."

His eyes glistened, his cheeks were inflated with rage. “The\ncase is plain,” said he; “having nothing of signification to offer in\nhis own favour, he grows refractory, and abuses the court in his base\nRoman Catholic jargon; but I’ll let you know, for all you pretend to be\na prince, you are no better than an outlawed vagrant, and I’ll show you\nwhat a thing you are when you come in composition with an English\njustice, like me, who have more than once extinguished myself in the\nservice of my country. As nothing else accrues, your purse, black box,\nand papers shall be sealed up before witnesses, and sent by express to\none of his Majesty’s secretaries of state; and, as for yourself, I will\napply to the military at Canterbury, for a guard to conduct you to\nLondon.”This was a very unwelcome declaration to our adventurer, who was on the\npoint of haranguing the justice and spectators in their own language,\nwhen he was relieved from the necessity of taking that step by the\ninterposition of a young nobleman just arrived at the inn, who, being\ninformed of this strange examination, entered the court, and, at first\nsight of the prisoner, assured the justice he was imposed upon; for\nthat he himself had often seen the Young Pretender in Paris, and that\nthere was no kind of resemblance between that adventurer and the person\nnow before him. The accuser was not a little mortified at his\nlordship’s affirmation, which met with all due regard from the bench,\nthough the magistrate took notice, that, granting the prisoner was not\nthe Young Chevalier himself, it was highly probable he was an emissary\nof that house, as he could give no satisfactory account of himself, and\nwas possessed of things of such value as no honest man could expose to\nthe accidents of the road.Fathom, having thus found an interpreter, who signified to him, in the\nFrench tongue, the doubts of the justice, told his lordship, that he\nwas a gentleman of a noble house in Germany, who, for certain reasons,\nhad come abroad incognito, with a view to see the world; and that,\nalthough the letters they had seized would prove the truth of that\nassertion, he should be loth to expose his private concerns to the\nknowledge of strangers, if he could possibly be released without that\nmortification. The young nobleman explained his desire to the court;\nbut, his own curiosity being interested, observed, at the same time,\nthat the justice could not be said to have discharged the duties of his\nstation, until he should have examined every circumstance relating to\nthe prisoner. Upon which remonstrance, he was requested by the bench to\nperuse the papers, and accordingly communicated the substance of one\nletter to this effect:—"

I have therefore, without the\nknowledge of your father, sent the bearer to attend you in your\nperegrinations; his fidelity you know hath been tried in a long course\nof service, and I have entrusted to his care, for your use, a purse of\ntwo hundred ducats, and a box of jewels to the value of twice that sum,\nwhich, though not sufficient to support an equipage suitable to your\nbirth, will, at least for some time, preserve you from the\nimportunities of want. When you are dutiful enough to explain your\ndesigns and situation, you may expect further indulgence from your\ntender and disconsolate mother,—THE COUNTESS OF FATHOM.”This letter, which, as well as the others, our hero had forged for the\npurpose, effectually answered his intent, in throwing dust in the eyes\nand understanding of the spectators, who now regarded the prisoner with\nlooks of respectful remorse, as a man of quality who had been falsely\naccused. His lordship, to make a parade of his own politeness and\nimportance, assured the bench, he was no stranger to the family of the\nFathoms, and, with a compliment, gave Ferdinand to understand he had\nformerly seen him at Versailles. There being no longer room for\nsuspicion, the justice ordered our adventurer to be set at liberty, and\neven invited him to be seated, with an apology for the rude manner in\nwhich he had been treated, owing to the misinformation of the accuser,\nwho was threatened with the stocks, for his malice and presumption.But this was not the only triumph our hero obtained over the wine\nmerchant. Maurice was no sooner unfettered, than, advancing into the\nmiddle of the room, “My lord,” said he, addressing himself in French to\nhis master’s deliverer, “since you have been so generous as to protect\na noble stranger from the danger of such a false accusation, I hope you\nwill still lay an additional obligation upon the Count, by retorting\nthe vengeance of the law upon his perfidious accuser, whom I know to be\na trader in those articles of merchandise which are prohibited by the\nordinances of this nation. I have seen him lately at Boulogne, and am\nperfectly well acquainted with some persons who have supplied him with\nFrench lace and embroidery; and, as a proof of what I allege, I desire\nyou will order him and this barber, who is his understrapper, to be\nexamined on the spot.”"

The merchant, seeing\nhis expectation so unhappily reversed, made an effort to retire with a\nmost rueful aspect, but was prevented by the officer, who demanded the\ninterposition of the civil power, that he might undergo the same\nexamination to which the other had been subjected. He was accordingly\nrifled without loss of time, and the inquiry proved well worth the care\nof him who made it; for a considerable booty of the same sort of\nmerchandise was found in his boots, breeches, hat, and between the\nbuckram and lining of his surtout. Yet, not contented with this prize,\nthe experienced spoiler proceeded to search his baggage, and,\nperceiving a false bottom in his portmanteau, detected beneath it a\nvaluable accession to the plunder he had already obtained.CHAPTER THIRTYTHE SINGULAR MANNER OF FATHOM’S ATTACK AND TRIUMPH OVER THE VIRTUE OF\nTHE FAIR ELENOR.Proper cognisance being thus taken of these contraband effects, and the\ninformer furnished with a certificate, by which he was entitled to a\nshare of the seizure, the coachman summoned his passengers to the\ncarriage; the purse and jewels were restored to Count Fathom, who\nthanked the justice, and his lordship in particular, for the candour\nand hospitality with which he had been treated, and resumed his place\nin the vehicle, amidst the congratulations of all his\nfellow-travellers, except the two forlorn smugglers, who, instead of\nre-embarking in the coach, thought proper to remain at the inn, with\nview to mitigate, if possible, the severity of their misfortune."

The artful language of his eyes had raised in her breast certain\nfluttering emotions, before she knew the value of her conquest; but now\nthat his rank and condition were discovered, these transports were\nincreased by the ideas of vanity and ambition, which are mingled with\nthe first seeds of every female constitution. The belief of having\ncaptivated the heart of a man who could raise her to the rank and\ndignity of a countess, produced such agreeable sensations in her fancy,\nthat her eyes shone with unusual lustre, and a continual smile played\nin dimples on her rosy cheeks; so that her attractions, though not\npowerful enough to engage the affection, were yet sufficient to inflame\nthe desire of our adventurer, who very honestly marked her chastity for\nprey to his voluptuous passion. Had she been well seasoned with\nknowledge and experience, and completely armed with caution against the\nartifice and villany of man, her virtue might not have been able to\nwithstand the engines of such an assailant, considering the dangerous\nopportunities to which she was necessarily exposed. How easy then must\nhis victory have been over an innocent, unsuspecting country damsel,\nflushed with the warmth of youth, and an utter stranger to the ways of\nlife!While Obadiah, therefore, and his plump companion, were engaged in\nconversation, on the strange incidents which had passed, Fathom acted a\nvery expressive pantomime with this fair buxom nymph, who comprehended\nhis meaning with surprising facility, and was at so little pains to\nconceal the pleasure she took in this kind of intercourse, that several\nwarm squeezes were interchanged between her and her lover, before they\narrived at Rochester, where they proposed to dine. It was during this\nperiod, he learned from the answers she made to the inquisitive quaker,\nthat her sole dependence was upon a relation, to whom she had a letter,\nand that she was a perfect stranger in the great city; circumstances on\nwhich he soon formed the project of her ruin."

The\nfreedoms which she, out of pure simplicity and good-humour, permitted\nhim to take with her hand, and even her rosy lips, encouraged him to\npractise other familiarities upon her fair bosom, which scandalised her\nvirtue so much, that, in spite of the passion she had begun to indulge\nin his behalf, she rejected his advances with all the marks of anger\nand disdain; and he found it necessary to appease the storm he had\nraised, by the most respectful and submissive demeanour; resolving to\nchange his operations, and carry on his attacks, so as to make her\nyield at discretion, without alarming her religion or pride.\nAccordingly, when the bill was called after dinner, he took particular\nnotice of her behaviour, and, perceiving her pull out a large leathern\npurse that contained her money, reconnoitred the pocket in which it was\ndeposited, and, while they sat close to each other in the carriage,\nconveyed it with admirable dexterity into an hole in the cushion.\nWhether the corpulent couple, who sat opposite to these lovers, had\nentered into an amorous engagement at the inn, or were severally\ninduced by other motives, is uncertain; but sure it is, both left the\ncoach on that part of the road which lies nearest to Gravesend, and\nbade adieu to the other pair, on pretence of having urgent business at\nthat place.Ferdinand, not a little pleased at their departure, renewed his most\npathetic expressions of love, and sung several French songs on that\ntender subject, which seemed to thrill to the soul of his beauteous\nHelen. While the driver halted at Dartford to water his horses, she was\nsmit with the appearance of some cheesecakes, which were presented by\nthe landlady of the house, and having bargained for two or three, put\nher hand in her pocket, in order to pay for her purchase; but what was\nher astonishment, when, after having rummaged her equipage, she\nunderstood her whole fortune was lost! This mishap was, by a loud\nshriek, announced to our hero, who affected infinite amazement and\nconcern; and no sooner learned the cause of her affliction, than he\npresented her with his own purse, from which he, in emphatic dumb show,\nbegged she would indemnify herself for the damage she had sustained.\nAlthough this kind proffer was some alleviation of her misfortunes, she\ndid not fail to pour forth a most piteous lamentation, importing that\nshe had not only lost all her money, amounting to five pounds, but also\nher letter of recommendation, upon which she had altogether relied for\npresent employment."

In a word, he rendered this conjecture so plausible, by\nwresting the circumstances of their behaviour and retreat, that poor\nElenor implicitly believed they were the thieves by whom she had\nsuffered; and was prevailed upon to accept the proffered assistance of\nthe generous Count, who, seeing her very much disordered by this\nmischance, insisted upon her drinking a large glass of canary, to quiet\nthe perturbation of her spirits. This is a season, which of all others\nis most propitious to the attempts of an artful lover; and justifies\nthe metaphorical maxim of fishing in troubled waters. There is an\naffinity and short transition betwixt all the violent passions that\nagitate the human mind. They are all false perspectives, which, though\nthey magnify, yet perplex and render indistinct every object which they\nrepresent. And flattery is never so successfully administered, as to\nthose who know they stand in need of friendship, assent, and\napprobation.The cordial she swallowed, far from calming, increased the disturbance\nof her thoughts, and produced an intoxication; during which, she talked\nin an incoherent strain, laughed and wept by turns, and acted other\nextravagances, which are known to be symptoms of the hysterical\naffection. Fathom, though an utter stranger to the sentiments of\nhonour, pity, and remorse, would not perpetrate his vicious purpose,\nthough favoured by the delirium his villany had entailed upon this\nunfortunate young maiden; because his appetite demanded a more perfect\nsacrifice than that which she could yield in her present deplorable\nsituation, when her will must have been altogether unconcerned in his\nsuccess. Determined, therefore, to make a conquest of her virtue,\nbefore he would take possession of her person, he mimicked that\ncompassion and benevolence which his heart had never felt, and, when\nthe coach arrived at London, not only discharged what she owed for her\nplace, but likewise procured for her an apartment in the house to which\nhe himself had been directed for lodgings, and even hired a nurse to\nattend her during a severe fever, which was the consequence of her\ndisappointment and despondence. Indeed, she was supplied with all\nnecessaries by the generosity of this noble Count, who, for the\ninterest of his passion, and the honour of his name, was resolved to\nextend his charity to the last farthing of her own money, which he had\nbeen wise enough to secure for this purpose."

She knew herself in a strange place, destitute of all\nresource but in his generosity. She loved his person, she was dazzled\nby his rank; and he knew so well how to improve the opportunities and\nadvantages he derived from her unhappy situation, that he gradually\nproceeded in sapping from one degree of intimacy to another, until all\nthe bulwarks of her chastity were undermined, and she submitted to his\ndesire; not with the reluctance of a vanquished people, but with all\nthe transports of a joyful city, that opens its gates to receive a\ndarling prince returned from conquest. For by this time he had artfully\nconcentred and kindled up all the inflammable ingredients of her\nconstitution; and she now looked back upon the virtuous principles of\nher education, as upon a disagreeable and tedious dream, from which she\nhad waked to the fruition of never-fading joy.CHAPTER THIRTY-ONEHE BY ACCIDENT ENCOUNTERS HIS OLD FRIEND, WITH WHOM HE HOLDS A\nCONFERENCE, AND RENEWS A TREATY.Our hero, having thus provided himself with a proper subject for his\nhours of dalliance, thought it was now high time to study the ground\nwhich he had pitched upon for the scene of his exploits, and with that\nview made several excursions to different parts of the town, where\nthere was aught of entertainment or instruction to be found. Yet he\nalways, on these occasions, appeared in an obscure ordinary dress, in\norder to avoid singularity, and never went twice to the same\ncoffee-house, that his person might not be afterwards known, in case he\nshould shine forth to the public in a superior sphere. On his return\nfrom one of those expeditions, while he was passing through Ludgate,\nhis eyes were suddenly encountered by the apparition of his old friend\nthe Tyrolese, who, perceiving himself fairly caught in the toil, made a\nvirtue of necessity, and, running up to our adventurer with an aspect\nof eagerness and joy, clasped him in his arms, as some dear friend,\nwhom he had casually found after a most tedious and disagreeable\nseparation.Fathom, whose genius never failed him in such emergencies, far from\nreceiving these advances with the threats and reproaches which the\nother had deserved at his hands, returned the salute with equal warmth,\nand was really overjoyed at meeting with a person who might one way or\nother make amends for the perfidy of his former conduct. The Tyrolese,\nwhose name was Ratchcali, pleased with his reception, proposed they\nshould adjourn to the next tavern, in which they had no sooner taken\npossession of an apartment, than he addressed himself to his old\ncompanion in these words:—"

I have seen many a rich\nharvest lost, for want of a fellow-labourer in the vineyard; and I have\nmore than once fallen a sacrifice to a combination, which I could have\nresisted with the help of one able auxiliary. Indeed, I might prove\nwhat I allege by mathematical demonstration; and I believe nobody will\npretend to deny, that two heads are better than one, in all cases that\nrequire discernment and deliberation.”Ferdinand could not help owning the sanity of his observations, and\nforthwith acquiesced in his proposal of the new alliance; desiring to\nknow the character in which he acted on the English stage, and the\nscheme he would offer for their mutual emolument. At the same time he\nresolved within himself to keep such a strict eye over his future\nactions, as would frustrate any design he might hereafter harbour, of\nrepeating the prank he had so successfully played upon him, in their\njourney from the banks of the Rhine.“Having quitted you at Bar-le-duc,” resumed the Tyrolese, “I travelled\nwithout ceasing, until I arrived at Frankfort upon the Maine, where I\nassumed the character of a French chevalier, and struck some masterly\nstrokes, which you yourself would not have deemed unworthy of your\ninvention; and my success was the more agreeable, as my operations were\nchiefly carried on against the enemies of our religion. But my\nprosperity was not of long duration. Seeing they could not foil me at\nmy own weapons, they formed a damned conspiracy, by which I not only\nlost all the fruits of my industry, but likewise ran the most imminent\nhazard of my life. I had ordered some of those jewels which I had\nborrowed of my good friend Fathom to be new set in a fashionable taste,\nand soon after had an opportunity to sell one of these, at a great\nadvantage, to one of the fraternity, who offered an extraordinary price\nfor the stone, on purpose to effect my ruin. In less than\nfour-and-twenty hours after this bargain, I was arrested by the\nofficers of justice upon the oath of the purchaser, who undertook to\nprove me guilty of a fraud, in selling a Saxon pebble for a real\ndiamond; and this accusation was actually true; for the change had been\nartfully put upon me by the jeweller, who was himself engaged in the\nconspiracy."

Yet\nthis accommodation was not made so secretly, but that my character was\nblasted, and my credit overthrown; so that I was fain to relinquish my\noccasional equipage, and hire myself as journeyman to a lapidary, an\nemployment which I had exercised in my youth. In this obscure station,\nI laboured with great assiduity, until I made myself perfect in the\nknowledge of stones, as well as in the different methods of setting\nthem off to the best advantage; and having, by dint of industry and\naddress, got possession of a small parcel, set out for this kingdom, in\nwhich I happily arrived about four months ago; and surely England is\nthe paradise of artists of our profession.“One would imagine that nature had created the inhabitants for the\nsupport and enjoyment of adventurers like you and me. Not that these\nislanders open the arms of hospitality to all foreigners without\ndistinction. On the contrary, they inherit from their fathers an\nunreasonable prejudice against all nations under the sun; and when an\nEnglishman happens to quarrel with a stranger, the first term of\nreproach he uses is the name of his antagonist’s country, characterised\nby some opprobrious epithet, such as a chattering Frenchman, an Italian\nape, a German hog, and a beastly Dutchman; nay, their national\nprepossession is maintained even against those people with whom they\nare united under the same laws and government; for nothing is more\ncommon than to hear them exclaim against their fellow-subjects, in the\nexpressions of a beggarly Scot, and an impudent Irish bog-trotter. Yet\nthis very prejudice will never fail to turn to the account of every\nstranger possessed of ordinary talents; for he will always find\nopportunities of conversing with them in coffee-houses and places of\npublic resort, in spite of their professed reserve, which, by the bye,\nis so extraordinary, that I know some people who have lived twenty\nyears in the same house without exchanging one word with their\nnext-door neighbours; yet, provided he can talk sensibly, and preserve\nthe deportment of a sober gentleman, in those occasional conversations,\nhis behaviour will be the more remarkably pleasing, as it will\nagreeably disappoint the expectation of the person who had entertained\nnotions to his prejudice. When a foreigner has once crossed this bar,\nwhich perpetually occurs, he sails without further difficulty into the\nharbour of an Englishman’s goodwill; for the pique is neither personal\nnor rancorous, but rather contemptuous and national; so that, while he\ndespises a people in the lump, an individual of that very community may\nbe one of his chief favourites."

They are wealthy and mercantile, of\nconsequence liberal and adventurous, and so well disposed to take a\nman’s own word for his importance, that they suffer themselves to be\npreyed upon by such a bungling set of impostors, as would starve for\nlack of address in any other country under the sun. This being a true\nsketch of the British character, so far as I have been able to observe\nand learn, you will easily comprehend the profits that may be extracted\nfrom it, by virtue of those arts by which you so eminently excel;—the\ngreat, the unbounded prospect lies before me! Indeed, I look upon this\nopulent kingdom as a wide and fertile common, on which we adventurers\nmay range for prey, without let or molestation. For so jealous are the\nnatives of their liberties, that they will not bear the restraint of\nnecessary police, and an able artist may enrich himself with their\nspoils, without running any risk of attracting the magistrate, or\nincurring the least penalty of the law.“In a word, this metropolis is a vast masquerade, in which a man of\nstratagem may wear a thousand different disguises, without danger of\ndetection.

One glides into a nobleman’s\nhouse in the capacity of a valet-de-chambre, and in a few months leads\nthe whole family by the nose. Another exhibits himself to the public,\nas an empiric or operator for the teeth; and by dint of assurance and\naffidavits, bearing testimony to wonderful cures that never were\nperformed, whirls himself into his chariot, and lays the town under\ncontribution. A third professes the composition of music, as well as\nthe performance, and by means of a few capriciosos on the violin,\nproperly introduced, wriggles himself into the management of private\nand public concerts. And a fourth breaks forth at once in all the\nsplendour of a gay equipage, under the title and denomination of a\nforeign count.
