I have therefore, without the\nknowledge of your father, sent the bearer to attend you in your\nperegrinations; his fidelity you know hath been tried in a long course\nof service, and I have entrusted to his care, for your use, a purse of\ntwo hundred ducats, and a box of jewels to the value of twice that sum,\nwhich, though not sufficient to support an equipage suitable to your\nbirth, will, at least for some time, preserve you from the\nimportunities of want. When you are dutiful enough to explain your\ndesigns and situation, you may expect further indulgence from your\ntender and disconsolate mother,—THE COUNTESS OF FATHOM.”This letter, which, as well as the others, our hero had forged for the\npurpose, effectually answered his intent, in throwing dust in the eyes\nand understanding of the spectators, who now regarded the prisoner with\nlooks of respectful remorse, as a man of quality who had been falsely\naccused. His lordship, to make a parade of his own politeness and\nimportance, assured the bench, he was no stranger to the family of the\nFathoms, and, with a compliment, gave Ferdinand to understand he had\nformerly seen him at Versailles. There being no longer room for\nsuspicion, the justice ordered our adventurer to be set at liberty, and\neven invited him to be seated, with an apology for the rude manner in\nwhich he had been treated, owing to the misinformation of the accuser,\nwho was threatened with the stocks, for his malice and presumption.But this was not the only triumph our hero obtained over the wine\nmerchant. Maurice was no sooner unfettered, than, advancing into the\nmiddle of the room, “My lord,” said he, addressing himself in French to\nhis master’s deliverer, “since you have been so generous as to protect\na noble stranger from the danger of such a false accusation, I hope you\nwill still lay an additional obligation upon the Count, by retorting\nthe vengeance of the law upon his perfidious accuser, whom I know to be\na trader in those articles of merchandise which are prohibited by the\nordinances of this nation. I have seen him lately at Boulogne, and am\nperfectly well acquainted with some persons who have supplied him with\nFrench lace and embroidery; and, as a proof of what I allege, I desire\nyou will order him and this barber, who is his understrapper, to be\nexamined on the spot.”"

The merchant, seeing\nhis expectation so unhappily reversed, made an effort to retire with a\nmost rueful aspect, but was prevented by the officer, who demanded the\ninterposition of the civil power, that he might undergo the same\nexamination to which the other had been subjected. He was accordingly\nrifled without loss of time, and the inquiry proved well worth the care\nof him who made it; for a considerable booty of the same sort of\nmerchandise was found in his boots, breeches, hat, and between the\nbuckram and lining of his surtout. Yet, not contented with this prize,\nthe experienced spoiler proceeded to search his baggage, and,\nperceiving a false bottom in his portmanteau, detected beneath it a\nvaluable accession to the plunder he had already obtained.CHAPTER THIRTYTHE SINGULAR MANNER OF FATHOM’S ATTACK AND TRIUMPH OVER THE VIRTUE OF\nTHE FAIR ELENOR.Proper cognisance being thus taken of these contraband effects, and the\ninformer furnished with a certificate, by which he was entitled to a\nshare of the seizure, the coachman summoned his passengers to the\ncarriage; the purse and jewels were restored to Count Fathom, who\nthanked the justice, and his lordship in particular, for the candour\nand hospitality with which he had been treated, and resumed his place\nin the vehicle, amidst the congratulations of all his\nfellow-travellers, except the two forlorn smugglers, who, instead of\nre-embarking in the coach, thought proper to remain at the inn, with\nview to mitigate, if possible, the severity of their misfortune."

  "content": "Among those who felicitated Fathom upon the issue of this adventure,\nthe young maiden seemed to express the most sensible pleasure at that\nevent. The artful language of his eyes had raised in her breast certain\nfluttering emotions, before she knew the value of her conquest; but now\nthat his rank and condition were discovered, these transports were\nincreased by the ideas of vanity and ambition, which are mingled with\nthe first seeds of every female constitution. The belief of having\ncaptivated the heart of a man who could raise her to the rank and\ndignity of a countess, produced such agreeable sensations in her fancy,\nthat her eyes shone with unusual lustre, and a continual smile played\nin dimples on her rosy cheeks; so that her attractions, though not\npowerful enough to engage the affection, were yet sufficient to inflame\nthe desire of our adventurer, who very honestly marked her chastity for\nprey to his voluptuous passion. Had she been well seasoned with\nknowledge and experience, and completely armed with caution against the\nartifice and villany of man, her virtue might not have been able to\nwithstand the engines of such an assailant, considering the dangerous\nopportunities to which she was necessarily exposed. How easy then must\nhis victory have been over an innocent, unsuspecting country damsel,\nflushed with the warmth of youth, and an utter stranger to the ways of\nlife!While Obadiah, therefore, and his plump companion, were engaged in\nconversation, on the strange incidents which had passed, Fathom acted a\nvery expressive pantomime with this fair buxom nymph, who comprehended\nhis meaning with surprising facility, and was at so little pains to\nconceal the pleasure she took in this kind of intercourse, that several\nwarm squeezes were interchanged between her and her lover, before they\narrived at Rochester, where they proposed to dine. It was during this\nperiod, he learned from the answers she made to the inquisitive quaker,\nthat her sole dependence was upon a relation, to whom she had a letter,\nand that she was a perfect stranger in the great city; circumstances on\nwhich he soon formed the project of her ruin."

  "content": "Upon their arrival at the Black Bull, he for the first time found\nhimself alone with his Amanda, whose name was Elenor, their\nfellow-travellers being elsewhere employed about their own concerns;\nand, unwilling to lose the precious opportunity, he began to act the\npart of a very importunate lover, which he conceived to be a proper\nsequel to the prelude which had been performed in the coach. The\nfreedoms which she, out of pure simplicity and good-humour, permitted\nhim to take with her hand, and even her rosy lips, encouraged him to\npractise other familiarities upon her fair bosom, which scandalised her\nvirtue so much, that, in spite of the passion she had begun to indulge\nin his behalf, she rejected his advances with all the marks of anger\nand disdain; and he found it necessary to appease the storm he had\nraised, by the most respectful and submissive demeanour; resolving to\nchange his operations, and carry on his attacks, so as to make her\nyield at discretion, without alarming her religion or pride.\nAccordingly, when the bill was called after dinner, he took particular\nnotice of her behaviour, and, perceiving her pull out a large leathern\npurse that contained her money, reconnoitred the pocket in which it was\ndeposited, and, while they sat close to each other in the carriage,\nconveyed it with admirable dexterity into an hole in the cushion.\nWhether the corpulent couple, who sat opposite to these lovers, had\nentered into an amorous engagement at the inn, or were severally\ninduced by other motives, is uncertain; but sure it is, both left the\ncoach on that part of the road which lies nearest to Gravesend, and\nbade adieu to the other pair, on pretence of having urgent business at\nthat place.Ferdinand, not a little pleased at their departure, renewed his most\npathetic expressions of love, and sung several French songs on that\ntender subject, which seemed to thrill to the soul of his beauteous\nHelen. While the driver halted at Dartford to water his horses, she was\nsmit with the appearance of some cheesecakes, which were presented by\nthe landlady of the house, and having bargained for two or three, put\nher hand in her pocket, in order to pay for her purchase; but what was\nher astonishment, when, after having rummaged her equipage, she\nunderstood her whole fortune was lost! This mishap was, by a loud\nshriek, announced to our hero, who affected infinite amazement and\nconcern; and no sooner learned the cause of her affliction, than he\npresented her with his own purse, from which he, in emphatic dumb show,\nbegged she would indemnify herself for the damage she had sustained.\nAlthough this kind proffer was some alleviation of her misfortunes, she\ndid not fail to pour forth a most piteous lamentation, importing that\nshe had not only lost all her money, amounting to five pounds, but also\nher letter of recommendation, upon which she had altogether relied for\npresent employment."

In a word, he rendered this conjecture so plausible, by\nwresting the circumstances of their behaviour and retreat, that poor\nElenor implicitly believed they were the thieves by whom she had\nsuffered; and was prevailed upon to accept the proffered assistance of\nthe generous Count, who, seeing her very much disordered by this\nmischance, insisted upon her drinking a large glass of canary, to quiet\nthe perturbation of her spirits. This is a season, which of all others\nis most propitious to the attempts of an artful lover; and justifies\nthe metaphorical maxim of fishing in troubled waters. There is an\naffinity and short transition betwixt all the violent passions that\nagitate the human mind. They are all false perspectives, which, though\nthey magnify, yet perplex and render indistinct every object which they\nrepresent. And flattery is never so successfully administered, as to\nthose who know they stand in need of friendship, assent, and\napprobation.The cordial she swallowed, far from calming, increased the disturbance\nof her thoughts, and produced an intoxication; during which, she talked\nin an incoherent strain, laughed and wept by turns, and acted other\nextravagances, which are known to be symptoms of the hysterical\naffection. Fathom, though an utter stranger to the sentiments of\nhonour, pity, and remorse, would not perpetrate his vicious purpose,\nthough favoured by the delirium his villany had entailed upon this\nunfortunate young maiden; because his appetite demanded a more perfect\nsacrifice than that which she could yield in her present deplorable\nsituation, when her will must have been altogether unconcerned in his\nsuccess. Determined, therefore, to make a conquest of her virtue,\nbefore he would take possession of her person, he mimicked that\ncompassion and benevolence which his heart had never felt, and, when\nthe coach arrived at London, not only discharged what she owed for her\nplace, but likewise procured for her an apartment in the house to which\nhe himself had been directed for lodgings, and even hired a nurse to\nattend her during a severe fever, which was the consequence of her\ndisappointment and despondence. Indeed, she was supplied with all\nnecessaries by the generosity of this noble Count, who, for the\ninterest of his passion, and the honour of his name, was resolved to\nextend his charity to the last farthing of her own money, which he had\nbeen wise enough to secure for this purpose."

She knew herself in a strange place, destitute of all\nresource but in his generosity. She loved his person, she was dazzled\nby his rank; and he knew so well how to improve the opportunities and\nadvantages he derived from her unhappy situation, that he gradually\nproceeded in sapping from one degree of intimacy to another, until all\nthe bulwarks of her chastity were undermined, and she submitted to his\ndesire; not with the reluctance of a vanquished people, but with all\nthe transports of a joyful city, that opens its gates to receive a\ndarling prince returned from conquest. For by this time he had artfully\nconcentred and kindled up all the inflammable ingredients of her\nconstitution; and she now looked back upon the virtuous principles of\nher education, as upon a disagreeable and tedious dream, from which she\nhad waked to the fruition of never-fading joy.CHAPTER THIRTY-ONEHE BY ACCIDENT ENCOUNTERS HIS OLD FRIEND, WITH WHOM HE HOLDS A\nCONFERENCE, AND RENEWS A TREATY.Our hero, having thus provided himself with a proper subject for his\nhours of dalliance, thought it was now high time to study the ground\nwhich he had pitched upon for the scene of his exploits, and with that\nview made several excursions to different parts of the town, where\nthere was aught of entertainment or instruction to be found. Yet he\nalways, on these occasions, appeared in an obscure ordinary dress, in\norder to avoid singularity, and never went twice to the same\ncoffee-house, that his person might not be afterwards known, in case he\nshould shine forth to the public in a superior sphere. On his return\nfrom one of those expeditions, while he was passing through Ludgate,\nhis eyes were suddenly encountered by the apparition of his old friend\nthe Tyrolese, who, perceiving himself fairly caught in the toil, made a\nvirtue of necessity, and, running up to our adventurer with an aspect\nof eagerness and joy, clasped him in his arms, as some dear friend,\nwhom he had casually found after a most tedious and disagreeable\nseparation.Fathom, whose genius never failed him in such emergencies, far from\nreceiving these advances with the threats and reproaches which the\nother had deserved at his hands, returned the salute with equal warmth,\nand was really overjoyed at meeting with a person who might one way or\nother make amends for the perfidy of his former conduct. The Tyrolese,\nwhose name was Ratchcali, pleased with his reception, proposed they\nshould adjourn to the next tavern, in which they had no sooner taken\npossession of an apartment, than he addressed himself to his old\ncompanion in these words:—"

  "content": "“Mr. Fathom, by your frank and obliging manner of treating a man who\nhath done you wrong, I am more and more confirmed in my opinion of your\nsagacity, which I have often considered with admiration; I will not\ntherefore attempt to make an apology for my conduct at our last\nparting; but only assure you that this meeting may turn out to our\nmutual advantage, if we now re-enter into an unreserved union, the ties\nof which we will soon find it our interest and inclination to preserve.\nFor my own part, as my judgment is ripened by experience, so are my\nsentiments changed since our last association. I have seen many a rich\nharvest lost, for want of a fellow-labourer in the vineyard; and I have\nmore than once fallen a sacrifice to a combination, which I could have\nresisted with the help of one able auxiliary. Indeed, I might prove\nwhat I allege by mathematical demonstration; and I believe nobody will\npretend to deny, that two heads are better than one, in all cases that\nrequire discernment and deliberation.”Ferdinand could not help owning the sanity of his observations, and\nforthwith acquiesced in his proposal of the new alliance; desiring to\nknow the character in which he acted on the English stage, and the\nscheme he would offer for their mutual emolument. At the same time he\nresolved within himself to keep such a strict eye over his future\nactions, as would frustrate any design he might hereafter harbour, of\nrepeating the prank he had so successfully played upon him, in their\njourney from the banks of the Rhine.“Having quitted you at Bar-le-duc,” resumed the Tyrolese, “I travelled\nwithout ceasing, until I arrived at Frankfort upon the Maine, where I\nassumed the character of a French chevalier, and struck some masterly\nstrokes, which you yourself would not have deemed unworthy of your\ninvention; and my success was the more agreeable, as my operations were\nchiefly carried on against the enemies of our religion. But my\nprosperity was not of long duration. Seeing they could not foil me at\nmy own weapons, they formed a damned conspiracy, by which I not only\nlost all the fruits of my industry, but likewise ran the most imminent\nhazard of my life. I had ordered some of those jewels which I had\nborrowed of my good friend Fathom to be new set in a fashionable taste,\nand soon after had an opportunity to sell one of these, at a great\nadvantage, to one of the fraternity, who offered an extraordinary price\nfor the stone, on purpose to effect my ruin. In less than\nfour-and-twenty hours after this bargain, I was arrested by the\nofficers of justice upon the oath of the purchaser, who undertook to\nprove me guilty of a fraud, in selling a Saxon pebble for a real\ndiamond; and this accusation was actually true; for the change had been\nartfully put upon me by the jeweller, who was himself engaged in the\nconspiracy."

  "content": "“Had my conscience been clear of any other impeachment, perhaps I\nshould have rested my cause upon the equity and protection of the law;\nbut I foresaw that the trial would introduce an inquiry, to which I was\nnot at all ambitious of submitting, and therefore was fain to\ncompromise the affair, at the price of almost my whole fortune. Yet\nthis accommodation was not made so secretly, but that my character was\nblasted, and my credit overthrown; so that I was fain to relinquish my\noccasional equipage, and hire myself as journeyman to a lapidary, an\nemployment which I had exercised in my youth. In this obscure station,\nI laboured with great assiduity, until I made myself perfect in the\nknowledge of stones, as well as in the different methods of setting\nthem off to the best advantage; and having, by dint of industry and\naddress, got possession of a small parcel, set out for this kingdom, in\nwhich I happily arrived about four months ago; and surely England is\nthe paradise of artists of our profession.“One would imagine that nature had created the inhabitants for the\nsupport and enjoyment of adventurers like you and me. Not that these\nislanders open the arms of hospitality to all foreigners without\ndistinction. On the contrary, they inherit from their fathers an\nunreasonable prejudice against all nations under the sun; and when an\nEnglishman happens to quarrel with a stranger, the first term of\nreproach he uses is the name of his antagonist’s country, characterised\nby some opprobrious epithet, such as a chattering Frenchman, an Italian\nape, a German hog, and a beastly Dutchman; nay, their national\nprepossession is maintained even against those people with whom they\nare united under the same laws and government; for nothing is more\ncommon than to hear them exclaim against their fellow-subjects, in the\nexpressions of a beggarly Scot, and an impudent Irish bog-trotter. Yet\nthis very prejudice will never fail to turn to the account of every\nstranger possessed of ordinary talents; for he will always find\nopportunities of conversing with them in coffee-houses and places of\npublic resort, in spite of their professed reserve, which, by the bye,\nis so extraordinary, that I know some people who have lived twenty\nyears in the same house without exchanging one word with their\nnext-door neighbours; yet, provided he can talk sensibly, and preserve\nthe deportment of a sober gentleman, in those occasional conversations,\nhis behaviour will be the more remarkably pleasing, as it will\nagreeably disappoint the expectation of the person who had entertained\nnotions to his prejudice. When a foreigner has once crossed this bar,\nwhich perpetually occurs, he sails without further difficulty into the\nharbour of an Englishman’s goodwill; for the pique is neither personal\nnor rancorous, but rather contemptuous and national; so that, while he\ndespises a people in the lump, an individual of that very community may\nbe one of his chief favourites."

They are too much engrossed with their own business to\npry into the conduct of their neighbours, and too indifferent, in point\nof disposition, to interest themselves in what they conceive to be\nforeign to their own concerns. They are wealthy and mercantile, of\nconsequence liberal and adventurous, and so well disposed to take a\nman’s own word for his importance, that they suffer themselves to be\npreyed upon by such a bungling set of impostors, as would starve for\nlack of address in any other country under the sun. This being a true\nsketch of the British character, so far as I have been able to observe\nand learn, you will easily comprehend the profits that may be extracted\nfrom it, by virtue of those arts by which you so eminently excel;—the\ngreat, the unbounded prospect lies before me! Indeed, I look upon this\nopulent kingdom as a wide and fertile common, on which we adventurers\nmay range for prey, without let or molestation. For so jealous are the\nnatives of their liberties, that they will not bear the restraint of\nnecessary police, and an able artist may enrich himself with their\nspoils, without running any risk of attracting the magistrate, or\nincurring the least penalty of the law.“In a word, this metropolis is a vast masquerade, in which a man of\nstratagem may wear a thousand different disguises, without danger of\ndetection. There is a variety of shapes in which we the knights of\nindustry make our appearance in London. One glides into a nobleman’s\nhouse in the capacity of a valet-de-chambre, and in a few months leads\nthe whole family by the nose. Another exhibits himself to the public,\nas an empiric or operator for the teeth; and by dint of assurance and\naffidavits, bearing testimony to wonderful cures that never were\nperformed, whirls himself into his chariot, and lays the town under\ncontribution. A third professes the composition of music, as well as\nthe performance, and by means of a few capriciosos on the violin,\nproperly introduced, wriggles himself into the management of private\nand public concerts. And a fourth breaks forth at once in all the\nsplendour of a gay equipage, under the title and denomination of a\nforeign count. Not to mention those inferior projectors, who assume the\ncharacters of dancers, fencing-masters, and French ushers, or, by\nrenouncing their religion, seek to obtain a provision for life.“Either of these parts will turn to the account of an able actor; and,\nas you are equally qualified for all, you may choose that which is most\nsuitable to your own inclination. Though, in my opinion, you was\ndesigned by nature to shine in the great world, which, after all, is\nthe most ample field for men of genius; because the game is deeper, and\npeople of fashion being, for the most part, more ignorant, indolent,\nvain, and capricious, than their inferiors, are of consequence more\neasily deceived; besides, their morals sit generally so loose about\nthem, that, when a gentleman of our fraternity is discovered in the\nexercise of his profession, their contempt of his skill is the only\ndisgrace he incurs.”"

Ratchcali, that same evening, hired\nmagnificent lodgings for Count Fathom, in the court end of the town,\nand furnished his wardrobe and liveries from the spoils of Monmouth\nStreet; he likewise enlisted another footman and valet-de-chambre into\nhis service, and sent to the apartments divers large trunks, supposed\nto be filled with the baggage of this foreign nobleman, though, in\nreality, they contained little else than common lumber.Next day, our adventurer took possession of his new habitation, after\nhaving left to his friend and associate the task of dismissing the\nunfortunate Elenor, who was so shocked at the unexpected message, that\nshe fainted away; and when she recovered the use of her senses so well\nas to reflect upon her forlorn condition, she was seized with the most\nviolent transports of grief and dismay, by which her brain was\ndisordered to such a degree, that she grew furious and distracted, and\nwas, by the advice and assistance of the Tyrolese, conveyed into the\nhospital of Bethlem; where we shall leave her for the present, happily\nbereft of her reason.CHAPTER THIRTY-TWOHE APPEARS IN THE GREAT WORLD WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AND ADMIRATION.Meanwhile, Fathom and his engine were busied in completing his\nequipage, so that in a few days he had procured a very gay chariot,\nadorned with painting, gilding, and a coat of arms, according to his\nown fancy and direction. The first use he made of this vehicle was that\nof visiting the young nobleman from whom he had received such important\ncivilities on the road, in consequence of an invitation at parting, by\nwhich he learned his title and the place of his abode in London."

He had\nthought proper to tell the nobleman, at their first interview in town,\nthat his reasons for concealing his knowledge of the English tongue\nwere now removed, and that he would no longer deny himself the pleasure\nof speaking a language which had been always music to his ear. He had\nalso thanked his lordship for his generous interposition at the inn,\nwhich was an instance of that generosity and true politeness which are\nengrossed by the English people, who leave nought to other nations but\nthe mere shadow of these virtues.A testimony like this, from the mouth of such a noble stranger, won the\nheart of the peer, who professed a friendship for him on the spot, and\nundertook to see justice done to his lacquey, who in a short time was\ngratified with a share of the seizure which had been made upon his\ninformation, amounting to fifty or sixty pounds.Ferdinand put not forth the whole strength of his accomplishments at\nonce, but contrived to spring a new mine of qualification every day, to\nthe surprise and admiration of all his acquaintance. He was gifted with\na sort of elocution, much more specious than solid, and spoke on every\nsubject that occurred in conversation with that familiarity and ease,\nwhich, one would think, could only be acquired by long study and\napplication. This plausibility and confidence are faculties really\ninherited from nature, and effectually serve the possessor, in lieu of\nthat learning which is not to be obtained without infinite toil and\nperseverance.

They abstained\nfrom animal food with the abhorrence of Pythagoreans, their drink was a\npure simple element, they were vomited once a week, took physic or a\nglyster every third day, spent the forenoon in algebraical\ncalculations, and slept from four o’clock till midnight, that they\nmight then take the field with that cool serenity which is the effect\nof refreshment and repose."

Indeed, no man ever set out with a\nfairer prospect on such an expedition; for he had found means to render\nhimself so agreeable to the fair sex, that, like the boxes of the\nplayhouse, during the representation of a new performance, his company\nwas often bespoke for a series of weeks; and no lady, whether widow,\nwife, or maiden, ever mentioned his name, without some epithet of\nesteem or affection; such as the dear Count! the charming Man! the\nNonpareil, or the Angel!While he thus shone in the zenith of admiration, it is not to be\ndoubted, that he could have melted some wealthy dowager or opulent\nward; but, being an enemy to all precipitate engagements, he resolved\nto act with great care and deliberation in an affair of such\nimportance, especially as he did not find himself hurried by the\nimportunities of want; for, since his arrival in England, he had rather\nincreased than exhausted his finances, by methods equally certain and\nsecure. In a word, he, with the assistance of Ratchcali, carried on a\ntraffic, which yielded great profits, without subjecting the trader to\nthe least loss or inconvenience. Fathom, for example, wore upon his\nfinger a large brilliant, which he played to such advantage one night,\nat a certain nobleman’s house, where he was prevailed upon to entertain\nthe company with a solo on the violin, that everybody present took\nnotice of its uncommon lustre, and it was handed about for the perusal\nof every individual. The water and the workmanship were universally\nadmired; and one among the rest having expressed a desire of knowing\nthe value of such a jewel, the Count seized that opportunity of\nentertaining them with a learned disquisition into the nature of\nstones; this introduced the history of the diamond in question, which\nhe said had been purchased of an Indian trader of Fort St. George, at\nan under price; so that the present proprietor could afford to sell it\nat a very reasonable rate; and concluded with telling the company,\nthat, for his own part, he had been importuned to wear it by the\njeweller, who imagined it would have a better chance for attracting a\npurchaser on his finger, than while it remained in his own custody."

Nor was this bargain such as reflected\ndishonour upon the lady’s taste, or could be productive of ill\nconsequences to the merchant; for the method of estimating diamonds is\naltogether arbitrary; and Ratchcali, who was an exquisite lapidary, had\nset it in such a manner as would have imposed upon any ordinary\njeweller. By these means of introduction, the Tyrolese soon monopolised\nthe custom of a great many noble families, upon which he levied large\ncontributions, without incurring the least suspicion of deceit. He\nevery day, out of pure esteem and gratitude for the honour of their\ncommands, entertained them with the sight of some new trinket, which he\nwas never permitted to carry home unsold; and from the profits of each\njob, a tax was raised for the benefit of our adventurer.Yet his indultos were not confined to the article of jewels, which\nconstituted only one part of his revenue. By the industry of his\nunderstrapper, he procured a number of old crazy fiddles, which were\nthrown aside as lumber; upon which he counterfeited the Cremona mark,\nand otherwise cooked them up with great dexterity; so that, when he had\noccasion to regale the lovers of music, he would send for one of these\nvamped instruments, and extract from it such tones as quite ravished\nthe hearers; among whom there was always some conceited pretender, who\nspoke in raptures of the violin, and gave our hero an opportunity of\nlaunching out in its praise, and declaring it was the best Cremona he\nhad ever touched. This encomium never failed to inflame the desires of\nthe audience, to some one of whom he was generous enough to part with\nit at prime cost—that is, for twenty or thirty guineas clear profit;\nfor he was often able to oblige his friends in this manner, because,\nbeing an eminent connoisseur, his countenance was solicited by all the\nmusicians, who wanted to dispose of such moveables."

Every\nauction afforded some picture, in which, though it had been overlooked\nby the ignorance of the times, he recognised the style of a great\nmaster, and made a merit of recommending it to some noble friend. This\ncommerce he likewise extended to medals, bronzes, busts, intaglios, and\nold china, and kept divers artificers continually employed in making\nantiques for the English nobility. Thus he went on with such rapidity\nof success in all his endeavours, that he himself was astonished at the\ninfatuation he had produced. Nothing was so wretched among the\nproductions of art, that he could not impose upon the world as a\ncapital performance; and so fascinated were the eyes of his admirers,\nhe could easily have persuaded them that a barber’s bason was an\nEtrurian patera, and the cover of a copper pot no other than the shield\nof Ancus Martius. In short, it was become so fashionable to consult the\nCount in everything relating to taste and politeness, that not a plan\nwas drawn, not even a house furnished, without his advice and\napprobation; nay, to such a degree did his reputation in these matters\nexcel, that a particular pattern of paper-hangings was known by the\nname of Fathom; and his hall was every morning crowded with\nupholsterers, and other tradesmen, who came, by order of their\nemployers, to learn his choice, and take his directions.The character and influence he thus acquired, he took care to maintain\nwith the utmost assiduity and circumspection. He never failed to appear\nthe chief personage at all public diversions and private assemblies,\nnot only in conversation and dress, but also in the article of dancing,\nin which he outstripped all his fellows, as far as in every other\ngenteel accomplishment.CHAPTER THIRTY-THREEHE ATTRACTS THE ENVY AND ILL OFFICES OF THE MINOR KNIGHTS OF HIS OWN\nORDER, OVER WHOM HE OBTAINS A COMPLETE VICTORY.Such a pre-eminence could not be enjoyed without exciting the\nmalevolence of envy and detraction, in the propagation of which none\nwere so industrious as the brethren of his own order, who had, like\nhim, made a descent upon this island, and could not, without repining,\nsee the whole harvest in the hands of one man, who, with equal art and\ndiscretion, avoided all intercourse with their society. In vain they\nstrove to discover his pedigree, and detect the particular\ncircumstances of his life and conversation; all their inquiries were\nbaffled by the obscurity of his origin, and that solitary scheme which\nhe had adopted in the beginning of his career. The whole fruit of their\ninvestigation amounted to no more than a certainty that there was no\nfamily of any consideration in Europe known by the denomination of\nFathom; and this discovery they did not fail to divulge for the benefit\nof our adventurer, who had by this time taken such firm root in the\nfavour of the great, as to set all those little arts at defiance; and\nwhen the report reached his ear, actually made his friends merry with\nthe conjectures which had been circulated at his expense."

It was upon this supposition that they left to the\ndetermination of the dice the choice of the person who should execute\ntheir plan; and the lot falling upon a Swiss, who, from the station of\na foot soldier in the Dutch service, out of which he had been drummed\nfor theft, had erected himself into the rank of a self-created\nchevalier, this hero fortified himself with a double dose of brandy,\nand betook himself to a certain noted coffee-house, with an intent to\naffront Count Fathom in public.He was lucky enough to find our adventurer sitting at a table in\nconversation with some persons of the first rank; upon which he seated\nhimself in the next box, and after having intruded himself into their\ndiscourse, which happened to turn upon the politics of some German\ncourts, “Count,” said he to Ferdinand, in a very abrupt and\ndisagreeable manner of address, “I was last night in company with some\ngentlemen, among whom a dispute happened about the place of your\nnativity; pray, what country are you of?” “Sir,” answered the other,\nwith great politeness, “I at present have the honour to be of England.”\n“Oho!” replied the chevalier, “I ask your pardon, that is to say, you\nare incog; some people may find it convenient to keep themselves in\nthat situation.” “True,” said the Count, “but some people are too well\nknown to enjoy that privilege.” The Swiss being a little disconcerted\nat this repartee, which extracted a smile from the audience, after some\npause, observed, that persons of a certain class had good reason to\ndrop the remembrance of what they have been; but a good citizen will\nnot forget his country, or former condition. “And a bad citizen,” said\nFathom, “cannot, if he would, provided he has met with his deserts; a\nsharper may as well forget the shape of a die, or a discarded soldier\nthe sound of a drum.”"

  "content": "As the chevalier’s character and story were not unknown, this\napplication raised an universal laugh at his expense, which provoked\nhim to such a degree, that, starting up, he swore Fathom could not have\nmentioned any object in nature that he himself resembled so much as a\ndrum, which was exactly typified by his emptiness and sound, with this\ndifference, however, that a drum was never noisy till beaten, whereas\nthe Count would never be quiet, until he should have undergone the same\ndiscipline. So saying, he laid his hand upon his sword with a menacing\nlook, and walked out as if in expectation of being followed by our\nadventurer, who suffered himself to be detained by the company, and\nvery calmly took notice, that his antagonist would not be ill pleased\nat their interposition. Perhaps he would not have comported himself\nwith such ease and deliberation, had not he made such remarks upon the\ndisposition of the chevalier, as convinced him of his own safety. He\nhad perceived a perplexity and perturbation in the countenance of the\nSwiss, when he first entered the coffee-room; his blunt and precipitate\nway of accosting him seemed to denote confusion and compulsion; and, in\nthe midst of his ferocity, this accurate observer discerned the\ntrepidation of fear. By the help of these signs, his sagacity soon\ncomprehended the nature of his schemes, and prepared accordingly for a\nformal defiance.His conjecture was verified next morning by a visit from the chevalier,\nwho, taking it for granted that Fathom would not face an adversary in\nthe field, because he had not followed him from the coffee-house, went\nto his lodgings with great confidence, and demanded to see the Count\nupon an affair that would admit of no delay. Maurice, according to his\ninstructions, told him that his master was gone out, but desired he\nwould have the goodness to repose himself in the parlour, till the\nCount’s return, which he expected every moment. Ferdinand, who had\ntaken post in a proper place for observation, seeing his antagonist\nfairly admitted, took the same road, and appearing before him, wrapped\nup in a long Spanish cloak, desired to know what had procured him the\nhonour of such an early visit. The Swiss, raising his voice to conceal\nhis agitation, explained his errand, in demanding reparation for the\ninjury his honour had sustained the preceding day, in that odious\nallusion to a scandalous report which had been raised by the malice of\nhis enemies; and insisted, in a very imperious style, upon his\nattending him forthwith to the nursery in Hyde Park. “Have a little\npatience,” said our adventurer with great composure, “and I will do\nmyself the pleasure to wait upon you in a few moments.”"

This phenomenon made\nsuch an impression upon the astonished chevalier, already discomposed\nby the resolute behaviour of the Count, that he became jaundiced with\nterror and dismay, and, while his teeth chattered in his head, told our\nhero he had hoped, from his known politeness, to have found him ready\nto acknowledge an injury which might have been the effect of anger or\nmisapprehension, in which case the affair might have been compromised\nto their mutual satisfaction, without proceeding to those extremities\nwhich, among men of honour, are always accounted the last resource. To\nthis representation Ferdinand answered, that the affair had been of the\nchevalier’s own seeking, inasmuch as he had intruded himself into his\ncompany, and treated him with the most insolent and unprovoked abuse,\nwhich plainly flowed from a premeditated design against his honour and\nreputation; he, therefore, far from being disposed to own himself in\nthe wrong, would not even accept of a public acknowledgment from him,\nthe aggressor, whom he looked upon as an infamous sharper, and was\nresolved to chastise accordingly.Here the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a person who\nwas brought to the door in a chair, and conducted into another\napartment, from which a message was brought to the Count, importing,\nthat the stranger desired to speak with him upon business of the last\nimportance. Fathom having chid the servant for admitting people without\nhis order, desired the Swiss to excuse him for a minute longer, and\nwent in to the next room, from whence the following dialogue was\noverheard by this challenger:—“Count,” said the stranger, “you are not\nignorant of my pretensions to the heart of that young lady, at whose\nhouse I met you yesterday; therefore you cannot be surprised when I\ndeclare myself displeased with your visits and behaviour to my\nmistress, and demand that you will instantly promise to drop the\ncorrespondence.” “Else what follows?” answered Ferdinand, with a cool\nand temperate voice. “My resentment and immediate defiance,” replied\nthe other; “for the only alternative I propose is, to forego your\ndesign upon that lady, or to decide our pretension by the sword.”"
