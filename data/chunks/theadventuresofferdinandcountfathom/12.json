  "content": "While this auxiliary plied the disconsolate Monimia on one hand, Fathom\nwas not remiss on the other. He now seemed to have sacrificed his\npassion to her quiet; his discourse turned upon more indifferent\nsubjects. He endeavoured to dispel her melancholy with arguments drawn\nfrom philosophy and religion. On some occasions, he displayed all his\nfund of good humour, with a view to beguile her sorrow; he importuned\nher to give him the pleasure of squiring her to some place of innocent\nentertainment; and, finally, insisted upon her accepting a pecuniary\nreinforcement to her finances, which he knew to be in a most\nconsumptive condition.CHAPTER FORTY-NINEMONIMIA’S HONOUR IS PROTECTED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF HEAVEN.With that complacency and fortitude which were peculiar to herself,\nthis hapless stranger resisted all those artful temptations. Her\nsustenance was barely such as exempted her from the guilt of being\naccessory to her own death; her drink was the simple element. She\nencouraged no discourse but that which turned upon the concerns of her\nimmortal part. She never went abroad, except in visits to a French\nchapel in the neighbourhood; she refused the proffered assistance of\nour adventurer with equal obstinacy and politeness, and with pleasure\nsaw herself wasting towards that period of mortality which was the\nconsummation of her wish. Yet her charms, far from melting away with\nher constitution, seemed to triumph over the decays of nature. Her\nshape and features still retained that harmony for which they had\nalways been distinguished. A mixture of majesty and sweetness diffused\nitself in her looks, and her feebleness added to that soft and feminine\ngrace which attracts the sympathy, and engages the protection of every\nhumane beholder. The associates thus baffled in their attempts to\nexcite her ideas of pleasure, again shifted their plan, and resolved to\nattack this forlorn beauty on the side of fear and mortification.Our adventurer became less frequent in his visits, and more indifferent\nin his language and deportment; while Madam la Mer gradually relaxed in\nthat complacency and respect with which she had hitherto behaved\ntowards her fair lodger. She even began to drop hints of disapprobation\nand reproach against this pattern of innocence and beauty, and at\nlength grew bold enough to tell her, that her misfortunes could be\nattributed to nothing but her own obstinacy and pride; that she had\nbeen at great pains to disoblige the only person who was able and\nwilling to raise her above dependence; and that, if his protection\nshould be withdrawn, she must be exposed to the utmost extremity of\ndistress."

Notwithstanding this\nanimated reply, she underwent the most deplorable anguish, when she\nreflected upon the insolence of this woman, from whose barbarity she\nhad no resource; and, seeing no other possibility of redress than that\nof appealing to the good offices of Fathom, she conquered her\nreluctance so far, as to complain to him of Madam la Mer’s incivility.Pleased with this application, he gave her to understand, with very\nlittle ceremony or preamble, that it wholly depended upon herself\nwhether she should continue to be wretched, or be delivered at once\nfrom all her cares and perplexity; that, notwithstanding the disdain\nwith which she had treated his addresses, he was still ready to lay\nhimself and his fortune at her feet; and that, if she should again\nreject the disinterested proposal, the whole world and her own\nconscience would charge upon herself whatever calamities she might be\nsubjected to in the sequel. Interpreting into a favourable hesitation\nher silence, which was the result of wrath and amazement, he proceeded\nto throw himself at her feet, and utter a romantic rhapsody, in the\ncourse of which, laying aside all that restraint which he had hitherto\npreserved, he seized her delicate hand, and pressed it to his lips;\nnay, so far did he forget himself on this occasion, that he caught the\nfair creature in his arms, and rudely ravished a kiss from those lips\nwhich he had before contemplated with the most distant reverence of\ndesire.Having thus broken down the fences of decorum, and being heated with\ntransport, he, in all probability, would have acted the part of young\nTarquin, and violated by force that sacred shrine of honour, beauty,\nand unblemished truth, had not the wrath kindled by such an unexpected\noutrage inspired her with strength and spirits sufficient to protect\nher virtue, and intimidate the ruffian who could offer violence to such\nperfection. She broke from his detested embrace with surprising\nagility, and called aloud to her landlady for assistance; but that\ndiscreet matron was resolved to hear nothing, and Fathom’s appetite\nbeing whetted to a most brutal degree of eagerness, “Madam,” said he,\n“all opposition is vain. What you have refused to my entreaties, you\nshall yield to my power; and I am determined to force you to your own\nadvantage.”"

These were\ndreadful reflections to a young lady who had been born to affluence and\nsplendour, trained up in all the elegance of education, by nature\nfraught with that sensibility which refines the sentiment and taste,\nand so tenderly cherished by her indulgent parents, that they suffered\nnot the winds of Heaven to visit her face too roughly."

Thus attended, the hapless mourner entered the\nplace, and, according to the laudable hospitality of England, which is\nthe only country in Christendom where a stranger is not made welcome to\nthe house of God, this amiable creature, emaciated and enfeebled as she\nwas, must have stood in a common passage during the whole service, had\nnot she been perceived by a humane gentlewoman, who, struck with her\nbeauty and dignified air, and melted with sympathy at the ineffable\nsorrow which was visible in her countenance, opened the pew in which\nshe sat, and accommodated Monimia and her attendant. If she was\ncaptivated by her first appearance, she was not less affected by the\ndeportment of her fair guest, which was the pattern of genuine\ndevotion.In a word, this good lady, who was a merchant’s widow in opulent\ncircumstances, was inflamed with a longing desire to know and befriend\nthe amiable stranger, who, after service, turning about to thank her\nfor her civility, Madam Clement, with that frankness which is the\nresult of true benevolence, told her, she was too much prepossessed in\nher favour to let slip this opportunity of craving her acquaintance,\nand of expressing her inclination to alleviate, if possible, that\naffliction which was manifest in her looks.Monimia, overwhelmed with gratitude and surprise at this unexpected\naddress, gazed upon the lady in silence, and when she repeated her\ntenders of service, could make no other reply to her goodness, than by\nbursting into a flood of tears. This was a species of eloquence which\ndid not pass unregarded by Madam Clement, who, while her own eyes were\nbedewed with the drops of sympathy and compassion, took the lovely\norphan by the hand, and led her, without further ceremony, to her own\ncoach, that stood waiting at the door, whither they were followed by\nMrs. la Mer, who was so much confounded at the adventure, that she made\nno objections to the proposal of the lady, who handed her lodger into\nthe carriage; but retired, with all possible despatch, to make Fathom\nacquainted with this unforeseen event."

  "content": "Meanwhile the agitation of Monimia, at this providential deliverance,\nwas such as had well-nigh destroyed her tender frame. The blood flushed\nand forsook her cheeks by turns; she trembled from head to foot,\nnotwithstanding the consolatory assurances of Madam Clement, and,\nwithout being able to utter one word, was conducted to the house of\nthat kind benefactress, where the violence of her transports\noverpowered her constitution, and she sunk down upon a couch in a\nswoon, from which she was not easily recovered. This affecting\ncircumstance augmented the pity, and interested the curiosity of Madam\nClement, who concluded there was something very extraordinary in the\ncase of the stranger, to produce these agonies; and grew impatient to\nhear the particulars of her story.Monimia no sooner retrieved the use of her faculties, than looking\naround, and observing with what humane concern her new hostess was\nemployed in effecting her recovery, “Is this,” said she, “a flattering\nillusion of the brain? or am I really under the protection of some\nbeneficent being, whom Heaven hath inspired with generosity to rescue\nan hapless stranger from the most forlorn state of misery and woe?” Her\nvoice was at all times ravishingly sweet; and this exclamation was\npronounced with such pathetic fervour, that Madam Clement clasped her\nin her arms, and kissing her with all the eagerness of maternal\naffection, “Yes,” cried she, “fair creature, Heaven hath bestowed upon\nme an heart to compassionate, and power, I hope, to lighten the burden\nof your sorrows.”She then prevailed upon her to take some nourishment, and afterwards to\nrecount the particulars of her fate; a task she performed with such\naccuracy and candour, that Madam Clement, far from suspecting her\nsincerity, saw truth and conviction in every circumstance of her tale;\nand, having condoled her misfortunes, entreated her to forget them, or\nat least look upon herself as one sheltered under the care and tuition\nof a person whose study it would be to supply her want of natural\nparents. This would have been an happy vicissitude of fortune, had it\nnot arrived too late; but such a sudden and unlooked-for transition not\nonly disordered the faculties of poor Monimia’s mind, but also\noverpowered the organs of her body, already fatigued and enfeebled by\nthe distresses she had undergone; so that she was taken ill of a fever\nthat same night, and became delirious before morning, when a physician\nwas called to her assistance."

The good lady, although a little staggered\nat the genteel appearance and engaging address of this stranger, could\nnot prevail upon herself to believe that she had been imposed upon by\nher fair lodger, who by this time had given too convincing a proof of\nher sincerity; nevertheless, in order to prevent any dispute that might\nbe prejudicial to the health or recovery of Monimia, she gave him to\nunderstand, that she would not at present enter upon the merits of the\ncause, but only assure him, that the young lady was actually bereft of\nher senses, and in imminent danger of her life; for the truth of which\nassertions she would appeal to his own observation, and the opinion of\nthe physician, who was then employed in writing a prescription for the\ncure of her disease.So saying, she conducted him into the chamber, where he beheld the\nhapless virgin stretched upon a sick-bed, panting under the violence of\na distemper too mighty for her weakly frame, her hair dishevelled, and\ndiscomposure in her looks; all the roses of her youth were faded, yet\nall the graces of her beauty were not fled. She retained that sweetness\nand symmetry, which death itself could not destroy; and though her\ndiscourse was incoherent, her voice was still musical, resembling those\nfeathered songsters who warble their native wood-notes wild.Fathom, as upon all other occasions, so on this, did behave like an\ninimitable actor; he ran to the bedside, with all the trepidation of a\ndistracted lover; he fell upon his knees, and, while the tears rolled\ndown his cheeks, imprinted a thousand kisses on the soft hand of\nMonimia, who regarding him with a lack-lustre and undistinguishing eye,\n“Alas! Renaldo,” said she, “we were born to be unhappy.” “Would to\nHeaven,” cried Ferdinand, in a transport of grief, “the wretch Renaldo\nhad never been born! that is the villain who seduced the affection of\nthis unfortunate woman. I admitted the traitor into my friendship and\nconfidence, relieved him in his necessities; and, like the ungrateful\nviper, he hath stung the very bosom that cherished him in his\ndistress.” Then he proceeded to inform Madam Clement how he had\ndelivered that same Renaldo from prison, maintained him afterwards at a\ngreat expense, and at length furnished him with a sum of money and\nproper credentials to support his interest at the Court of Vienna."

He also\nthanked Madam Clement for her charity and benevolence towards a\nstranger, and took his leave with many polite professions of gratitude\nand esteem. He had no sooner quitted the house, than the physician, who\nwas a humane man, and a foreigner, began to caution the lady against\nhis insinuations, observing, that some circumstances of the story\nconcerning Renaldo were, to his particular knowledge, contrary to\ntruth; for that he himself had been applied to for letters of\nrecommendation in behalf of Count Melvil, by a Jew merchant of his\nacquaintance, who had supplied the young gentleman with money\nsufficient for his occasions, in consequence of a minute inquiry he had\nmade into the character of Renaldo, who was, by all reports, a youth of\nstrict honour and untainted morals.Madam Clement, thus cautioned, entered into deliberation with her own\nthoughts, and, comparing the particulars of this account with those of\nMonimia’s own story, she concluded that Fathom was the very traitor he\nhimself had described; and that he had, by abusing the confidence of\nboth, effected a fatal breach between two innocent and deserving\nlovers. She accordingly looked upon him with horror and detestation;\nbut nevertheless resolved to treat him with civility in the meantime,\nthat the poor young lady might not be disturbed in her last moments;\nfor she had now lost all hopes of her recovery. Yet the fever abated,\nand in two days she retrieved the use of her reason; though the\ndistemper had affected her lungs, and she was in all appearance doomed\nto linger a few weeks longer in a consumption.Fathom was punctual in his visitation, though never admitted into her\npresence after the delirium vanished; and he had the opportunity of\nseeing her conveyed in a chariot to Kensington Gravel Pits, a place\nwhich may be termed the last stage of many a mortal peregrination. He\nnow implicitly believed that death would in a few days baffle all his\ndesigns upon the unfortunate Monimia; and foreseeing that, as he had\nowned himself her husband, he might be obliged to defray the expenses\nincurred by her sickness and burial, he very prudently intermitted in\nhis visits, and had recourse to the intelligence of his auxiliary.As for Monimia, she approached the goal of life, not simply with\nresignation, but with rapture. She enjoyed in tranquillity the\nconversation of her kind benefactress, who never stirred from her\napartment; she was blessed with the spiritual consolation of a worthy\nclergyman, who removed all her religious scruples; and she\ncongratulated herself on the near prospect of that land of peace where\nsorrow is not known."

Upon which\nthese two virtuous associates took possession of a place from whence\nthey could, unperceived, behold the funeral. He must have a hard heart,\nwho, without an emotion of pity, can see the last offices performed to\na young creature cut off in the flower of youth and beauty, even though\nhe knows not her name, and is an utter stranger to her virtues. How\ncallous then must the soul of that wretch have been, who, without a\nsymptom of remorse or concern, saw the sable hearse adorned with white\nplumes, as emblems of Monimia’s purity, pass before him, while her\nincomparable merit stood full in his remembrance, and he knew himself\nthe wicked cause of her untimely fate!Perfidious wretch! thy crimes turn out so atrocious, that I half repent\nme of having undertaken to record thy memoirs; yet such monsters ought\nto be exhibited to public view, that mankind may be upon their guard\nagainst imposture; that the world may see how fraud is apt to overshoot\nitself; and that, as virtue, though it may suffer for a while, will\ntriumph in the end; so iniquity, though it may prosper for a season,\nwill at last be overtaken by that punishment and disgrace which are its\ndue.CHAPTER FIFTYFATHOM SHIFTS THE SCENE, AND APPEARS IN A NEW CHARACTER.Fathom’s expectations with respect to the fair orphan having thus\nproved abortive, he lost no time in bewailing his miscarriage, but had\nimmediate recourse to other means of improving his small fortune,\nwhich, at this period, amounted to near two hundred pounds. Whatever\ninclination he had to resume the character he had formerly borne in the\npolite world, he durst not venture to launch out again into the expense\nnecessary to maintain that station, because his former resources were\nnow stopped, and all the people of fashion by this time convinced of\nhis being a needy adventurer. Nevertheless, he resolved to sound the\nsentiments of his old friends at a distance, and judge, from the\nreception he should meet with, how far he might presume upon their\ncountenance and favour. For he rightly supposed, that if he could in\nany shape contribute to their interest or amusement, they would easily\nforgive his former pretensions to quality, arrogant as they were, and\nstill entertain him on the footing of a necessary acquaintance."

For, by this time, the few that remembered him knew from\nwhat retirement he now emerged, and avoided him accordingly as the jail\ninfection. But the greater part of those who had cultivated him in the\nzenith of his fortune were now utter strangers to his person, which\nthey had actually forgot, amidst the succession of novelties that\nsurrounded them; or, if they did recollect his name, it was remembered\nas an old fashion which had been many months out of date.Notwithstanding these mortifying discouragements, our hero, that same\nevening, effected a lodgment in a certain gaming-house not far from St.\nJames’s; and, as he played pretty high, and made a parade of his ready\nmoney, he was soon recognised by divers persons of consequence, who\ncordially welcomed him to England, on pretence of believing he had been\nabroad, and with great complacency repeated their former professions of\nfriendship. Though this was a certain way of retaining the favour of\nthose worthies, while his finances continued to flourish, and his\npayments were prompt, he knew the weakness of his funds too well, to\nthink they could bear the vicissitudes of play; and the remembrance of\nthe two British knights who had spoiled him at Paris, hung over his\nimagination with the most frightful presages. Besides, he perceived\nthat gaming was now managed in such a manner, as rendered skill and\ndexterity of no advantage. For the spirit of play having overspread the\nland, like a pestilence, raged to such a degree of madness and\ndesperation, that the unhappy people who were infected, laid aside all\nthoughts of amusement, economy, or caution, and risked their fortunes\nupon issues equally extravagant, childish, and absurd."

In one corner of the\nroom might be heard a pair of lordlings running their grandmothers\nagainst each other, that is, betting sums on the longest liver; in\nanother the success of the wager depended upon the sex of the\nlandlady’s next child; and one of the waiters happening to drop down in\nan apoplectic fit, a certain noble peer exclaimed, “Dead for a thousand\npounds.” The challenge was immediately accepted; and when the master of\nthe house sent for a surgeon to attempt the cure, the nobleman, who set\nthe price upon the patient’s head, insisted upon his being left to the\nefforts of nature alone, otherwise the wager should be void. Nay, when\nthe landlord harped upon the loss he should sustain by the death of a\ntrusty servant, his lordship obviated the objection, by desiring that\nthe fellow might be charged in the bill.In short, the rage of gaming seemed to have devoured all their other\nfaculties, and to have equalled the rash enthusiasm of the inhabitants\nof Malacca in the East Indies, who are so possessed with that\npernicious spirit, that they sacrifice to it not only their fortunes,\nbut also their wives and children; and then letting their hair down\nupon their shoulders, in imitation of the ancient Lacedaemonians when\nthey devoted themselves to death, those wretches unsheathe their\ndaggers, and murder every living creature in their way. In this,\nhowever, they differ from the gamesters of our country, who never find\ntheir senses, until they have lost their fortunes, and beggared their\nfamilies; whereas the Malays never run amuck, but in consequence of\nmisery and despair.Such are the amusements, or rather such is the continual employment of\nthose hopeful youths who are destined by birth to be the judges of our\nproperty, and pillars of our constitution. Such are the heirs and\nrepresentatives of those patriots who planned, and those heroes who\nmaintained, the laws and freedom of their country; who were the patrons\nof merit, the fathers of the poor, the terror of vice and immorality,\nand at once the ornaments and support of a happy nation.Our adventurer considered all these circumstances with his wonted\nsagacity, and, seeing upon what precarious footing he must stand,\nshould he rank himself with such society, he wisely came to the\nresolution of descending one step in the degrees of life, and of taking\nupon him the title of physician, under which he did not despair of\ninsinuating himself into the pockets of his patients, and into the\nsecrets of private families, so as to acquire a comfortable share of\npractice, or captivate the heart of some heiress or rich widow, whose\nfortune would at once render him independent and happy."

He\nfirst of all procured a few books on the subject of medicine, which he\nstudied with great attention during the remaining part of the winter\nand spring, and repaired to Tunbridge with the first of the season,\nwhere he appeared in the uniform of Aesculapius, namely, a plain suit,\nfull trimmed, with a voluminous tie-periwig; believing that in this\nplace he might glide, as it were, imperceptibly into the functions of\nhis new employment, and gradually accustom himself to the method and\nform of prescription.A man so well known in the gay world could not be supposed to effect\nsuch a transformation without being observed; and therefore, in order\nto anticipate the censure and ridicule of those who might be tempted to\nmake themselves merry at his expense, he, on his arrival at the wells,\nrepaired to the shop of an apothecary, and calling for pen, ink, and\npaper, wrote a prescription, which he desired might be immediately made\nup. While this was doing by the servant, he was invited into a parlour\nby the master, with whom he entered into conversation touching the\nproperties of the Tunbridge water, which seemed to have been his\nparticular study; and indeed he had perused Rouzee’s treatise on that\nsubject with indefatigable assiduity. From this theme, he made\ndigressions into other parts of medicine, upon which he spoke with such\nplausible elocution, that the apothecary, whose knowledge in that art\nwas not very profound, looked upon him as a physician of great learning\nand experience, and hinted a desire of knowing his name and situation.Fathom accordingly gave him to understand, that he had studied physic,\nand taken his degrees at Padua, rather for his amusement, than with any\nview of exercising medicine, as he then could not possibly foresee the\nmisfortunes which had since happened to his family, and by which he was\nnow compelled to have recourse to a profession that was very much\nbeneath the expectations of his birth. Yet he bore his disappointments\nwith resignation, and even good-humour, and blessed his stars for\nhaving inclined him to the study of any branch of knowledge by which he\nmight be enabled to laugh at the vicissitudes of fortune. He then\nobserved, that he had practised with some applause at the hot well near\nBristol, before he thought he should be ever reduced to the necessity\nof taking a fee, and that, in all probability, his metamorphosis, when\nknown, would furnish matter of surprise and merriment to some of his\nold acquaintance."

He consoled him for the misfortunes of\nhis family, by assuring him, that in England nothing could be more\nhonourable, or indeed profitable, than the character of a physician,\nprovided he could once wriggle himself into practice; and insinuated,\nthat, although he was restricted by certain engagements with other\npersons of the faculty, he should be glad of an opportunity to show his\nregard for Doctor Fathom. This was a very effectual method which our\nhero took to intimate his new character to the public. By the industry\nand communicative disposition of the apothecary, it was circulated in\nhalf a day through every family in the place; and, next morning, when\nFerdinand appeared, the company forthwith assembled in separate groups,\nand from each knot he heard his name reverberated in a whisper.Having thus announced himself to all whom it might concern, and allowed\nthe ladies two days to discuss the merit of his transfiguration,\ntogether with the novelty of the case, he ventured to salute, at a\ndistance, a lady and her daughter, who had been his patients at the hot\nwell; and, although they honoured his bow with the return of a slight\ncurtsey, they gave him not the least encouragement to make a nearer\napproach. Notwithstanding this rebuff, he concluded, that, should the\nhealth of either come in question, they would renew their application\nto his skill, and what was refused by their pride would be granted by\ntheir apprehension. Here, however, he happened to be mistaken in his\nconjecture.The young lady being seized with a violent headache and palpitation,\nher mother desired the apothecary to recommend a physician; and the\nperson with whom he was contracted being at that time absent, he\nproposed Doctor Fathom as a man of great ability and discretion. But\nthe good lady rejected the proposal with disdain, because she had\nformerly known him in the character of a Count—though that very\ncharacter was the chief reason that had then induced her to crave his\nadvice."

Thus, lifted into a higher sphere, their talents receive\ncultivation; they become professed bards, and though their subsequent\nworks bear evident marks of improvement, they are neglected among the\nrest of their brethren, because that novelty, which recommended them in\nthe beginning, no longer remains.So it fared with our adventurer in his new occupation. There was\nsomething so extraordinary in a nobleman’s understanding medicine, and\nso uncommon in a physician’s prescribing gratis, that the curiosity and\nadmiration of the company at Bristol were engaged, and they followed\nhis advice, as the direction of some supernatural intelligence. But,\nnow that he professed himself one of the faculty, and might be supposed\nto have refreshed his memory, and reinforced his knowledge for the\noccasion, he was as much overlooked as any other physician unsupported\nby interest or cabal; or, at least, the notice he attracted was not at\nall to the advantage of his character, because it wholly regarded the\ndecline of his fortune, which is a never-failing fund of disgrace."

At the ordinary which he frequented, his\npolite carriage, facetious remarks, and agreeable stories soon\nconciliated the regard of his fellow-guests, among whom he sometimes\nrallied his own transformation with singular good-humour and success.\nHe was even witty upon his want of employment, and used to observe,\nthat a physician without practice had one comfort to which his brethren\nwere strangers, namely, that the seldomer he had occasion to prescribe,\nthe less he had upon his conscience on account of being accessory to\nthe death of his fellow-creatures.Nothing so effectually blunts the shafts of ridicule, and defeats the\naims of slander, as this method of anticipation. In spite of the arrows\nthat were levelled against his reputation from every tea-table at\nTunbridge, he made his party good among almost all the gay young\ngentlemen that frequented the place. Far from avoiding his company,\nthey began to court his conversation, and he was commonly seen in the\nwalks surrounded with a group of admirers.Having thus paved the way for a total removal of the invidious\nprepossession that obstructed his views, he, one night, while every\nperson was lulled in the arms of repose, and universal silence\nprevailed, tuned his violin, and began to play some masterly airs, in a\ntone so uncommonly expressive, and with such ravishing dexterity of\nexecution, that a certain lady, who lodged in the same house, being\nwaked by the music, and ignorant of the source from which it flowed,\nlistened with rapture, as to the harp of an angel, and, wrapping\nherself in a loose gown, rose and opened her chamber door, in order to\ndiscover in what apartment the musician resided. She no sooner entered\nthe passage, than she found her fellow-lodgers already assembled on the\nsame occasion; and there they remained during the best part of the\nnight, transported by the harmony which our hero produced.Doctor Fathom was immediately known to be the author of this\nentertainment; and thus retrieved the benefit of that admiration which\nhe had forfeited by appearing in the shape of a physician. For, as\npeople had formerly wondered to see a count skilled in medicine, they\nwere now amazed to find a physician such a master in music."

  "content": "The good effects of this stratagem were almost instantaneous. His\nperformance became the topic of discourse among all the fashionable\ncompany. His male friends complimented him from the information of the\nother sex; and that lady whom he had regaled, instead of that shyness\nand disdain with which she used to receive his salutation, at their\nvery next meeting in the thoroughfare, returned his bow with marks of\nprofound respect. Nay, at midnight, she, with the rest, took post in\nthe same place where they had been stationed before; and, by frequent\ntittering, and repeated whispers, gave intimation to Fathom, that they\nwould be glad of a second serenade. But he was too well acquainted with\nthe human passions to indulge this their desire. It was his interest to\ninflame their impatience, rather than to gratify their expectation; and\ntherefore he tantalised them for some hours, by tuning his violin, and\nplaying some flourishes, which, however, produced nothing to fulfil\ntheir wishes.At the ordinary, he was accosted by a gentleman, a lodger in the same\nhouse, who assured him, that the ladies would take it as a great favour\nif he would let them know when he intended to amuse himself again with\nhis instrument, that they might not, by falling asleep beforehand,\ndeprive themselves of the pleasure of hearing his music. To this\nmessage he replied, with an air of consequence and reserve, that,\nthough music was not the art he professed, he should be always\ncomplaisant enough to entertain the ladies to the utmost of his power,\nwhen their commands were signified to him in a manner suited to his\ncharacter; but that he would never put himself on the footing of an\nitinerate harper, whose music is tolerated through the medium of a\nboard partition. The gentleman having reported this answer to his\nconstituents, they empowered him to invite Doctor Fathom to breakfast,\nand he was next morning introduced with the usual ceremony, and treated\nwith uncommon regard by all the females of the house, assembled for his\nreception.Having thus broken the ice of their aversion in one part, so as that\nthe beams of his personal accomplishments had room to operate, he soon\neffected a general thaw in his favour, and found himself growing once\nmore into request amongst the most amiable part of the creation. His\ncompany was coveted, and his taste consulted in their balls, concerts,\nand private assemblies; and he recompensed the regard they paid to him\nwith an incessant exertion of his agreeable talents, politeness, and\ngood-humour.CHAPTER FIFTY-ONETRIUMPHS OVER A MEDICAL RIVAL."

  "content": "Yet, in the midst of all this attention, his medical capacity seemed to\nbe quite forgot. They respected his good breeding, were charmed with\nhis voice, and admired the fine touches of his hand upon the violin;\nbut in cultivating the fiddler, they utterly neglected the physician;\nand in vain did he attempt to divide their regard, by taking all\nopportunities to turn the conversation into a more interesting channel.\nIt was to little purpose he endeavoured to arouse the wonder of his\naudience with frequent descriptions of portentous maladies and amazing\ncures he had seen and performed in the course of his study and practice\nabroad; and to no effect did he publicly busy himself in making\nexperiments on the mineral water, in which he pretended to have made\nseveral new and important discoveries. These efforts did not make a\nlasting impression upon the minds of the company; because they saw\nnothing surprising in a physician’s being acquainted with all the\nmysteries of his art; and, as their custom was already bespoke for\nothers of the profession, whom it was their interest to employ, our\nadventurer might have starved amidst the caresses of his acquaintance,\nhad not he derived considerable advantage from a lucky accident in the\ncourse of his expectancy.A gentlewoman’s daughter, of a weakly constitution, by drinking the\nwaters, had so far recovered her health and complexion, as to allure\nthe affection of a young squire in the neighbourhood, who amused her\nfor some time with his addresses, until his heart was seduced by the\ncharms of another young lady lately arrived at the wells. The forsaken\nnymph, shocked at this disgrace and mortification, relapsed into her\nformer languishing disorder; and was by her mother put under the\nmanagement and prescription of a physician, who had been an industrious\nenemy of Fathom from his first appearance at Tunbridge. The patient,\nthough violently chagrined at the levity of her quondam admirer, was\nnot altogether without hope, that the very same inconstancy which had\nprompted him to leave her, might in time induce him to return, after\nthe novelty of his new passion should be wore off; and this hope served\nto support her under the sorrow and disgrace of her disappointment. At\nlength, however, the squire and his new mistress disappeared; and some\nbusybody was officious enough to communicate this piece of news to the\nforlorn shepherdess, with this additional circumstance, that they were\ngone to a neighbouring parish to be joined in the bands of wedlock."

  "content": "These fatal tidings were no sooner imparted to the abandoned Phillis,\nthan she was seized with an hysteric fit; and, what rendered the\naccident more unfortunate, her physician had been called to the\ncountry, and was not expected at Tunbridge till next day. The\napothecary was immediately summoned; and, being either puzzled by the\nsymptoms, or afraid of encroaching upon the province of his superiors,\nadvised the old lady to send for Doctor Fathom without delay. She had\nno other objection to this expedient, but the enmity which she knew\nsubsisted between the two leeches; yet, hearing that her own doctor\nwould not consult with Fathom upon his return but, perhaps renounce the\npatient, by which means her daughter’s health might be endangered, she\nwould not solicit our hero’s assistance, until the young lady had\nremained seven hours speechless and insensible; when, her fear\nprevailing over every other consideration, she implored the advice of\nour adventurer, who, having made the necessary interrogations, and felt\nthe patient’s pulse, which was regular and distinct, found reason to\nconclude that the fit would not last much longer, and, after having\nobserved that she was in a very dangerous way, prescribed some\nmedicines for external application; and, to enhance their opinion of\nhis diligence and humanity, resolved to stay in the room and observe\ntheir effect.His judgment did not fail him on this occasion. In less than half an\nhour after his embrocations had been applied, she recovered the use of\nher tongue, opened her eyes, and having, in delirious exclamations,\nupbraided her perfidious lover, became quite sensible and composed,\nthough she continued extremely low and dejected. To remedy these\nsinkings, certain cordials were immediately administered, according to\nthe prescription of Doctor Fathom, upon whom extraordinary encomiums\nwere bestowed by all present, who believed he had actually rescued her\nfrom the jaws of death; and as he was by this time let into the secrets\nof the family, he found himself in a fair way of being an egregious\nfavourite of the old gentlewoman; when, unluckily, his brother, having\ndismissed his country patient with uncommon despatch, entered the\napartment, and eyed his rival with looks of inexpressible rage; then,\nsurveying the patient, and the phials that stood upon the table, by\nturns, “What, in the name of God!” cried he, “is the meaning of all\nthis trash!”“Really, doctor,” replied the mother, a little confounded at being thus\ntaken by surprise, “Biddy has been taken dangerously ill, and lain\nseven or eight hours in a severe fit, from which I am confident she\nwould never have recovered without the help of a physician; and as you\nwere absent, we had recourse to this gentleman, whose prescription hath\nhad a happy and surprising effect.” “Effect!” cried this offended\nmember of the faculty, “pshaw!—stuff!—who made you judge of effects or\ncauses?” Then advancing to the patient, “What has been the matter, Miss\nBiddy, that you could not wait till my return?”"

Nor is there one physician of note in this\nkingdom who has not derived the greatest part of his medical knowledge\nfrom the instructions of foreigners.”Looby, incensed at this asseveration, which he was not prepared to\nrefute, exclaimed, in a most infuriate accent, “Who are you?—whence\ncame you?—where was you bred? You are one of those, I believe, who\ngraduate themselves, and commence doctors, the Lord knows how; an\ninterloper, who, without licence or authority, comes hither to take the\nbread out of the mouths of gentlemen who have been trained to the\nbusiness in a regular manner, and bestowed great pains and expense to\nqualify themselves for the profession. For my own part, my education\ncost me fifteen hundred pounds.”"

You have even debased\nthe noblest and most beneficial art that ever engaged the study of\nmankind, which cannot be too much cultivated, and too little\nrestrained, in seeking to limit the practice of it to a set of\nnarrow-minded, illiberal wretches, who, like the lowest handicraftsmen,\nclaim the exclusive privileges of a corporation. Had you doubted my\nability, you ought to have satisfied yourself in a manner consistent\nwith decency and candour; but your behaviour on this occasion is such a\nmalicious outrage upon good manners and humanity, that, were it not for\nmy regard to these ladies, I would chastise you for your insolence on\nthe spot. Meanwhile, madam,” addressing himself to the mother, “you\nmust give me leave to insist upon your dismissing either that\ngentleman, or me, without hesitation.”This peremptory language had an instantaneous effect upon the hearers.\nLooby’s face grew pale, and his nether lip began to tremble. The\npatient was dismayed, and the old gentlewoman concerned and perplexed.\nShe earnestly besought the gentlemen to be reconciled to each other,\nand enter into a friendly consultation upon her daughter’s distemper;\nbut, finding both equally averse to accommodation, and Fathom becoming\nmore and more importunate in his demand, she presented him with a\ndouble fee; and giving him to understand that Doctor Looby had long\nattended the family, and was intimately acquainted with her own and\nBiddy’s constitution, said, she hoped he would not take it amiss if she\nretained her old physician.Though our hero was much mortified at this triumph of his rival, he\nmade a virtue of necessity, and retired with great complaisance,\nwishing that Miss Biddy might never again be the subject of such a\ndisagreeable dispute. Whether the patient was frighted at this\naltercation, or displeased with her mother’s decision against an\nagreeable young fellow, who had, as it were, recalled her from the\ngrave, and made himself master of the secret that rankled at her heart,\nor the disease had wound up her nerves for another paroxysm, certain it\nis, she all of a sudden broke forth into a violent peal of laughter,\nwhich was succeeded by the most doleful cries, and other expressions of\ngrief; then she relapsed into a fit, attended with strong convulsions,\nto the unspeakable terror of the old gentlewoman, who entreated Doctor\nLooby to be expeditious in his prescription. Accordingly he seized the\npen with great confidence, and a whole magazine of antihysteric\nmedicines were, in different forms, externally and internally applied."
