  "content": "That affair being negotiated, he adjourned into another room with\nRenaldo and his companion, who were not a little surprised to see this\nminister of Plutus in the shape of a young sprightly beau, trimmed up\nin all the foppery of the fashion; for they had hitherto always\nassociated with the idea of an usurer old age and rusty apparel. After\ndivers modish congees, he begged to know to what he should attribute\nthe honour of their message; when Ferdinand, who acted the orator, told\nhim, that his friend Count Melvil, having occasion for a sum of money,\nhad been directed to a gentleman of his name, “and, I suppose,” added\nhe, “you are the son of the person with whom the affair is to be\nnegotiated.”“Sir,” said this petit-maitre, with a smile, “I perceive you are\nsurprised to see one of my profession in the appearance of a gentleman;\nand perhaps your wonder will not cease, when I tell you, that my\neducation was liberal, and that I once had the honour to bear a\ncommission in the British army. I was indeed a first lieutenant of\nmarines, and will venture to say, that no officer in the service was\nmore delicate than myself in observing all the punctilios of honour. I\nentertained the utmost contempt for all the trading part of the nation,\nand suffered myself to be run through the body in a duel, rather than\nroll with a brother-lieutenant, who was a broker’s son. But, thank\nHeaven! I have long ago conquered all those ridiculous prejudices. I\nsoon observed, that without money there was no respect, honour, or\nconvenience to be acquired in life; that wealth amply supplied the want\nof wit, merit, and pedigree, having influence and pleasure ever at\ncommand; and that the world never failed to worship the flood of\naffluence, without examining the dirty channels through which it\ncommonly flowed.“At the end of the war, finding my appointments reduced to two\nshillings and fourpence per day, and being addicted to pleasures which\nI could not possibly purchase from such a fund, I sold my half-pay for\ntwo hundred pounds, which I lent upon bond to a young officer of the\nsame regiment, on condition that he should insure his life, and restore\none-fourth part of the sum by way of premium. I happened to be lucky in\nthis first essay; for the borrower, having in six weeks expended the\nmoney, made an excursion on the highway, was apprehended, tried,\nconvicted of felony, and cut his own throat, to prevent the shame of a\npublic execution; so that his bond was discharged by the insurers."

  "content": "“In short, gentlemen, when I engaged in this business, I determined to\ncarry it on with such spirit, as would either make my fortune, or\nentirely ruin me in a little time; and hitherto my endeavours have been\ntolerably successful. Nor do I think my proceedings a whit more\ncriminal or unjust than those of other merchants, who strive to turn\ntheir money to the best account. The commodity I deal in is cash; and\nit is my business to sell it to the best advantage. A London factor\nsends a cargo of goods to market, and if he gets two hundred per cent\nupon the sale, he is commended for industry and address. If I sell\nmoney for one-fourth part of that profit, certain persons will be so\nunjust as to cry, Shame upon me, for taking such advantage of my\nneighbour’s distress; not considering, that the trader took four times\nthe same advantage of those people who bought his cargo, though his\nrisk was not half so great as mine, and although the money I sold\nperhaps retrieved the borrower from the very jaws of destruction. For\nexample, it was but yesterday I saved a worthy man from being arrested\nfor a sum of money, for which he had bailed a friend who treacherously\nleft him in the lurch. As he did not foresee what would happen, he had\nmade no provision for the demand, and his sphere of life secluding him\nfrom all sorts of monied intercourse, he could not raise the cash by\nhis credit in the usual way of borrowing; so that, without my\nassistance, he must have gone to jail; a disgrace which would have\nproved fatal to the peace of his family, and utterly ruined his\nreputation.—Nay, that very young gentleman, from whom I am just now\nparted, will, in all probability, be indebted to me for a very genteel\nlivelihood. He had obtained the absolute promise of being provided for\nby a great man, who sits at the helm of affairs in a neighbouring\nkingdom; but, being destitute of all other resources, he could not have\nequipped himself for the voyage, in order to profit by his lordship’s\nintention, unless I had enabled him to pursue his good fortune.”"

  "content": "Renaldo was not a little pleased to hear this harangue, to which Fathom\nreplied with many florid encomiums upon the usurer’s good sense and\nhumane disposition; then he explained the errand of his friend, which\nwas to borrow three hundred pounds, in order to retrieve his\ninheritance, of which he had been defrauded in his absence.“Sir,” said the lender, addressing himself to Count Melvil, “I pretend\nto have acquired by experience some skill in physiognomy; and though\nthere are some faces so deeply disguised as to baffle all the\npenetration of our art, there are others, in which the heart appears\nwith such nakedness of integrity, as at once to recommend it to our\ngoodwill. I own your countenance prepossesses me in your favour; and\nyou shall be accommodated, upon those terms from which I never deviate,\nprovided you can find proper security, that you shall not quit the\nBritish dominions; for that, with me, is a condition sine qua non.”This was a very disagreeable declaration to Renaldo, who candidly\nowned, that, as his concerns lay upon the Continent, his purpose was to\nleave England without delay. The usurer professed himself sorry that it\nwas not in his power to oblige him; and, in order to prevent any\nfurther importunity, assured them, he had laid it down as a maxim, from\nwhich he would never swerve, to avoid all dealings with people whom, if\nneed should be, he could not sue by the laws of this realm.Thus the intervention of one unlucky and unforeseen circumstance\nblasted in an instant the budding hopes of Melvil, who, while his\nvisage exhibited the most sorrowful disappointment, begged to know, if\nthere was any person of his acquaintance who might be less scrupulous\nin that particular."

  "content": "The young gentleman directed them to another member of his profession,\nand wishing them success, took his leave with great form and\ncomplaisance. This instance of politeness was, however, no more than a\nshift to disengage himself the more easily from their entreaties; for,\nwhen the case was opened to the second usurer, he blessed himself from\nsuch customers, and dismissed them with the most mortifying and boorish\nrefusal. Notwithstanding these repulses, Renaldo resolved to make one\ndesperate push; and, without allowing himself the least respite,\nsolicited, one by one, not fewer than fifteen persons who dealt in this\nkind of traffic, and his proposals were rejected by each. At last,\nfatigued by the toil, and exasperated at the ill success of his\nexpedition, and half mad with the recollection of his finances, which\nwere now drained to half-a-crown, “Since we have nothing to expect,”\ncried he, “from the favour of Christians, let us have recourse to the\ndescendants of Judah. Though they lie under the general reproach of\nnations, as a people dead to virtue and benevolence, and wholly devoted\nto avarice, fraud, and extortion, the most savage of their tribe cannot\ntreat me with more barbarity of indifference, than I have experienced\namong those who are the authors of their reproach.”Although Fathom looked upon this proposal as an extravagant symptom of\ndespair, he affected to approve of the scheme, and encouraged Renaldo\nwith the hope of succeeding in another quarter, even if this expedition\nshould fail; for, by this time, our adventurer was half resolved to\nexport him at his own charge, rather than he should be much longer\nrestricted in his designs upon Monimia.Meanwhile, being resolved to try the experiment upon the children of\nIsrael, they betook themselves to the house of a rich Jew, whose wealth\nthey considered as a proof of his rapaciousness; and, being admitted\ninto his counting-house, they found him in the midst of half a dozen\nclerks, when Renaldo, in his imagination, likened him unto a minister\nof darkness surrounded by his familiars, and planning schemes of misery\nto be executed upon the hapless sons of men. In spite of these\nsuggestions, which were not at all mitigated by the forbidding aspect\nof the Hebrew, he demanded a private audience; and, being ushered into\nanother apartment, he explained his business with manifest marks of\ndisorder and affliction. Indeed, his confusion was in some measure\nowing to the looks of the Jew, who, in the midst of this exordium,\npulled down his eyebrows, which were surprisingly black and bushy, so\nas, in appearance, totally to extinguish his visage, though he was all\nthe time observing our youth from behind those almost impenetrable\nthickets.Melvil, having signified his request, “Young gentleman,” said the\nIsraelite, with a most discordant voice, “what in the name of goodness\ncould induce you to come to me upon such an errand? Did you ever hear\nthat I lent money to strangers without security?” “No,” replied\nRenaldo, “nor did I believe I should profit by my application; but my\naffairs are desperate; and my proposals having been rejected by every\nChristian to whom they were offered, I was resolved to try my fate\namong the Jews, who are reckoned another species of men.”"

  "content": "Fathom, alarmed at this abrupt reply, which he supposed could not fail\nto disgust the merchant, interposed in the conversation, by making an\napology for the plain dealing of his friend, who, he said, was soured\nand ruffled by his misfortunes; then exerting that power of eloquence\nwhich he had at command, he expostulated upon Renaldo’s claim and\nexpectations, described the wrongs he had suffered, extolled his\nvirtue, and drew a most pathetic picture of his distress.The Jew listened attentively for some time; then his eyebrows began to\nrise and fall alternately; he coughed, sneezed, and winking hard, “I’m\nplagued,” said he, “with a salt rheum that trickles from my eyes\nwithout intermission.” So saying, he wiped the moisture from his face,\nand proceeded in these words: “Sir, your story is plausible; and your\nfriend is a good advocate; but before I give an answer to your demand,\nI must beg leave to ask if you can produce undeniable evidence of your\nbeing the identical person you really assume? If you are really the\nCount de Melvil, you will excuse my caution. We cannot be too much on\nour guard against fraud; though I must own you have not the air of an\nimpostor.”Renaldo’s eyes began to sparkle at this preliminary question; to which\nhe replied, that he could procure the testimony of the Emperor’s\nminister, to whom he had occasionally paid his respects since his first\narrival in England.“If that be the case,” said the Jew, “take the trouble to call here\nto-morrow morning, at eight o’clock, and I will carry you in my own\ncoach to the house of his excellency, with whom I have the honour to be\nacquainted; and, if he has nothing to object against your character or\npretensions, I will contribute my assistance towards your obtaining\njustice at the Imperial court.”The Hungarian was so much confounded at this unexpected reception, that\nhe had not power to thank the merchant for his promised favour, but\nstood motionless and silent, while the streams of emotion of the heart\nwas of more weight with the Jew, than the eloquent acknowledgment which\nFerdinand took the opportunity of making for his friend; and he was\nfain to dismiss them a little abruptly, in order to prevent a second\ndischarge of that same rheum of which he had already complained."

  "content": "Melvil recollected all that had happened as a dream, which had no\nfoundation in truth, and was all day long in a sort of delirium,\nproduced by the alternate gusts of hope and fear that still agitated\nhis bosom; for he was not yet without apprehension of being again\ndisappointed by some unlucky occurrence.He did not, however, fail to be punctual to the hour of his\nappointment, when the Jew told him, there would be no occasion for\nvisiting the ambassador, because Renaldo had been, the preceding day,\nrecognised by one of the clerks who had been employed as a purveyor in\nthe Imperial army; and who, knowing his family, confirmed everything he\nhad alleged. “After breakfast,” continued this benevolent Israelite, “I\nwill give you an order upon my banker for five hundred pounds, that you\nmay be enabled to appear at Vienna as the son and representative of\nCount Melvil; and you shall also be furnished with a letter of\nrecommendation to a person of some influence at that court, whose\nfriendship and countenance may be of some service to your suit; for I\nam now heartily engaged in your interest, in consequence of the fair\nand unblemished character which I find you have hitherto maintained.”The reader must appeal to his own heart, to acquire a just idea of\nRenaldo’s feelings, when every tittle of these promises was fulfilled,\nand the merchant refused to take one farthing by way of premium,\ncontenting himself with the slender security of a personal bond. He\nwas, in truth, overwhelmed with the obligation, and certainly disposed\nto believe that his benefactor was something more than human. As for\nFathom, his sentiments took a different turn; and he scrupled not to\nimpute all this kindness to some deep-laid interested scheme, the scope\nof which he could not at present comprehend."

He mentioned her\nname to Fathom with marks of the most melting compassion, deplored her\napostasy, and, while he protested that he had divorced her for ever\nfrom his heart, expressed an inclination to see her once more before\nhis departure, that he might in person exhort her to penitence and\nreformation.Our adventurer, who dreaded such an interview as the infallible means\nof his own ruin, resisted the proposal with the whole power of his\nelocution. He affirmed, that Renaldo’s desire was a manifest proof that\nhe still retained part of the fatal poison which that enchantress had\nspread within his veins; and that the sight of her, softened by his\nreproaches into tears and affected contrition, would dispel his\nresentment, disable his manhood, and blow the embers of his former\npassion to such a rage, as would hurry him on to a reconciliation,\nwhich would debase his honour, and ruin his future peace. In a word,\nFerdinand described the danger that would attend the meeting in such\nemphatic terms, that the Hungarian started with horror at the picture\nwhich he drew, and in this particular conformed with the admonition of\nhis friend.One hundred pounds of the Jew’s money was immediately appropriated for\nthe payment of his most urgent debts; the like sum he presented to his\nfriend Fathom, with a solemn promise of sharing with him whatever good\nfortune might await him in Germany. And though Monimia had forfeited\nall title to his regard, so ill could he bear the prospect of her\ndistress, that he entrusted his dear companion with the half of what\nremained, to be expended for her use, fully resolving to screen her\nfrom the shocks and temptations of want, as the circumstances of his\nfuture fate would allow.Fathom, far from opposing, applauded his generosity with marks of\nextreme wonder and admiration, assuring him, that she should be put in\npossession of his bounty immediately after his departure, he being\nunwilling to make her acquainted with her good fortune before that\nperiod, lest, finding his affairs in a fair way of being retrieved, she\nshould be base enough to worship his returning prosperity, and, by\nfalse professions, and artful blandishments, seek to ensnare his heart\nanew.CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT"

He had before\nsolicited him to be his fellow-traveller, that he might personally\nenjoy the benefit of his conversation and superior sagacity; but these\nentreaties he strenuously opposed, on pretence of his being determined\nto push his fortune in England, which he considered as his native\ncountry, and as the land in which, of all others, a man of merit has\nthe best encouragement. Such were the reasons he alleged for refusing\nto attend his benefactor, who was himself eagerly desirous of attaining\na settlement in the island of Great Britain. But our hero’s real\nmotives for staying were of a very different complexion.—The reader is\nalready informed of his aim upon the fair orphan, which, at present,\nwas the chief spring of his conduct. He may also recollect such\npassages of his life, as were sufficient to deter him from reappearing\nat Presburg or Vienna. But, besides these reflections, he was detained\nby a full persuasion that Renaldo would sink under the power and\ninfluence of his antagonist, consequently be rendered incapable to\nprovide for his friends; and that he himself, fraught with wiles and\nexperience as he was, could not fail to make himself amends for what he\nhad suffered among a people equally rich and unthinking."

  "content": "Melvil, having embraced our adventurer, and with a deep sigh bid him\ntake care of the unfortunate Monimia, committed himself to the sea,\nand, by the assistance of a favourable gale, was in four hours safely\nlanded on the French shore; while Fathom took post-horses for London,\nwhere he arrived that same night, and next day, in the forenoon, went\nto visit the beauteous mourner, who had as yet received no intimation\nof Renaldo’s departure or design. He found her in the attitude of\nwriting a letter to her inconstant lover, the contents of which the\nreader will be acquainted with in due time. Her countenance,\nnotwithstanding the veil of melancholy by which it was overcast, seemed\naltogether serene and composed; she was the picture of pious\nresignation, and sat like PATIENCE on a monument, smiling at grief.\nAfter having paid the compliment of the morning, Fathom begged pardon\nfor having omitted to visit her during three days, in which, he said,\nhis time had been wholly engrossed in procuring a proper equipage for\nCount Melvil, who had at last bid an eternal adieu to the island of\nGreat Britain.At this information the hapless Monimia fell back in her chair, and\ncontinued some minutes in a swoon; from which being recovered, “Excuse\nme, Mr. Fathom,” cried she with a deep sigh; “this, I hope, is the last\nagony I shall feel from my unhappy passion.”—Then wiping the tears from\nher lovely eyes, she retrieved her tranquillity, and desired to know by\nwhat means Renaldo had been enabled to undertake his journey into the\nempire. Our hero, upon this occasion, assumed the whole merit of having\npromoted the interest of his friend, by giving her to understand, that\nhe, in consequence of an unforeseen windfall, had defrayed the expense\nof the Count’s equipment; though he observed, that it was not without\nreluctance he saw Renaldo make a wrong use of his friendship.“Although I was happy,” proceeded this artful traitor, “in being able\nto discharge my obligations to the house of Melvil, I could not help\nfeeling the most sensible chagrin, when I saw my assistance rendered\nsubservient to the triumphs of the youth’s baseness and infidelity; for\nhe chose, as the companion of his travels, the abandoned woman for whom\nhe had forsaken the all-perfect Monimia, whose virtue and\naccomplishments did not preserve her sacred from his ungrateful\nsarcasms and unmannerly ridicule. Believe me, madam, I was so shocked\nat his conversation on that subject, and so much incensed at his want\nof delicacy, that my temper was scarce sufficient for the ceremony of\nparting. And, now that my debt to his family is over-paid, I have\nsolemnly renounced his correspondence.”"

Yet she scorned to give\nspeech to her indignation; but, forcing a smile, “Why should I repine,”\nsaid she, “at the mortifications of a life which I despise, and from\nwhich, I hope, Heaven speedily will set me free!”Fathom, fired by her emotion, which had recalled all the graces of her\nbeauty, exclaimed in a rapture, “Talk not so contemptuously of this\nlife, which hath still a fund of happiness in store for the amiable,\nthe divine Monimia. Though one admirer hath proved an apostate to his\nvows, your candour will not suffer you to condemn the whole sex. Some\nthere are, whose bosoms glow with passion equally pure, unalterable,\nand intense. For my own part, I have sacrificed to a rigid punctilio of\nhonour the dearest ideas of my heart. I beheld your unrivalled charms,\nand deeply felt their power. Yet, while a possibility of Melvil’s\nreformation remained, and while I was restrained by my niggard fortune\nfrom making a tender worthy of your acceptance, I combated with my\ninclinations, and bore without repining the pangs of hopeless love.\nBut, now that my honour is disengaged, and my fortune rendered\nindependent, by the last will of a worthy nobleman, whose friendship I\nwas favoured with in France, I presume to lay myself at the feet of the\nadorable Monimia, as the most faithful of admirers, whose happiness or\nmisery wholly depends upon her nod. Believe me, madam, these are not\nthe professions of idle gallantry—I speak the genuine, though\nimperfect, language of my heart. Words, even the most pathetic, cannot\ndo justice to my love. I gaze upon your beauty with ravishment; but I\ncontemplate the graces of your soul with such awful veneration, that I\ntremble while I approach you, as if my vows were addressed to some\nsuperior being.”"

Then, rising from her seat, with all the\ndignity of displeasure, “Perhaps,” added she, “you have forgot who was\nthe father of the once happy Monimia.”With these words she retired into another chamber, leaving our\nadventurer confounded by the repulse he had sustained. Not that he was\ndiscouraged from prosecuting his aim—on the contrary, this rebuff\nseemed to add fresh vigour to his operations. He now thought it high\ntime to bring over Madam la Mer to his interest; and, to facilitate her\nconversion, took an opportunity of bribing her with some inconsiderable\npresents, after having amused her with a plausible tale of his passion\nfor Monimia, with whom she undertook the office of his mediatrix, on\nthe supposition that his intentions were honourable, and highly\nadvantageous to her lodger."

His agreeable person was often the\nsubject of her discourse to the fair mourner. Her admiration dwelt upon\nhis politeness, good sense, and winning deportment; and she every day\nretailed little stories of his benevolence and greatness of soul. The\ndefect in his birth she represented as a circumstance altogether\nforeign from the consideration of his merit; especially in a nation\nwhere such distinctions are as little respected as they will be in a\nfuture state. She mentioned several persons of note, who basked in the\nsunshine of power and fortune, without having enjoyed the least\nhereditary assistance from their forefathers. One, she said, sprung\nfrom the loins of an obscure attorney; another was the grandson of a\nvalet-de-chambre; a third was the issue of an accountant; and a fourth\nthe offspring of a woollen draper. All these were the children of their\nown good works, and had raised themselves upon their personal virtues\nand address; a foundation certainly more solid and honourable than a\nvague inheritance derived from ancestors, in whose deserts they could\nnot be supposed to have borne the least share.Monimia listened to all these arguments with great patience and\naffability, though she at once dived into the source from which all\nsuch insinuations flowed. She joined in the commendations of Fathom,\nand owned herself a particular instance of that benevolence which the\nold lady had so justly extolled; but, once for all, to prevent the\nsupplication which Madam la Mer was about to make, she solemnly\nprotested that her heart was altogether shut against any other earthly\nengagement, and that her thoughts were altogether employed upon her\neternal salvation.The assiduous landlady, perceiving the steadiness of her disposition,\nthought proper to alter her method of proceeding, and, for the present,\nsuspended that theme by which she found her fair lodger disobliged.\nResolved to reconcile Monimia to life, before she would again recommend\nFerdinand to her love, she endeavoured to amuse her imagination, by\nrecounting the occasional incidents of the day, hoping gradually to\ndecoy her attention to those sublunary objects from which it had been\nindustriously weaned. She seasoned her conversation with agreeable\nsallies; enlarged upon the different scenes of pleasure and diversion\nappertaining to this great metropolis; practised upon her palate with\nthe delicacies of eating; endeavoured to shake her temperance with\nrepeated proffers and recommendations of certain cordials and\nrestoratives, which she alleged were necessary for the recovery of her\nhealth; and pressed her to make little excursions into the fields that\nskirt the town, for the benefit of air and exercise."

He now seemed to have sacrificed his\npassion to her quiet; his discourse turned upon more indifferent\nsubjects. He endeavoured to dispel her melancholy with arguments drawn\nfrom philosophy and religion. On some occasions, he displayed all his\nfund of good humour, with a view to beguile her sorrow; he importuned\nher to give him the pleasure of squiring her to some place of innocent\nentertainment; and, finally, insisted upon her accepting a pecuniary\nreinforcement to her finances, which he knew to be in a most\nconsumptive condition.CHAPTER FORTY-NINEMONIMIA’S HONOUR IS PROTECTED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF HEAVEN.With that complacency and fortitude which were peculiar to herself,\nthis hapless stranger resisted all those artful temptations. Her\nsustenance was barely such as exempted her from the guilt of being\naccessory to her own death; her drink was the simple element. She\nencouraged no discourse but that which turned upon the concerns of her\nimmortal part. She never went abroad, except in visits to a French\nchapel in the neighbourhood; she refused the proffered assistance of\nour adventurer with equal obstinacy and politeness, and with pleasure\nsaw herself wasting towards that period of mortality which was the\nconsummation of her wish. Yet her charms, far from melting away with\nher constitution, seemed to triumph over the decays of nature. Her\nshape and features still retained that harmony for which they had\nalways been distinguished. A mixture of majesty and sweetness diffused\nitself in her looks, and her feebleness added to that soft and feminine\ngrace which attracts the sympathy, and engages the protection of every\nhumane beholder. The associates thus baffled in their attempts to\nexcite her ideas of pleasure, again shifted their plan, and resolved to\nattack this forlorn beauty on the side of fear and mortification.Our adventurer became less frequent in his visits, and more indifferent\nin his language and deportment; while Madam la Mer gradually relaxed in\nthat complacency and respect with which she had hitherto behaved\ntowards her fair lodger. She even began to drop hints of disapprobation\nand reproach against this pattern of innocence and beauty, and at\nlength grew bold enough to tell her, that her misfortunes could be\nattributed to nothing but her own obstinacy and pride; that she had\nbeen at great pains to disoblige the only person who was able and\nwilling to raise her above dependence; and that, if his protection\nshould be withdrawn, she must be exposed to the utmost extremity of\ndistress."

Notwithstanding this\nanimated reply, she underwent the most deplorable anguish, when she\nreflected upon the insolence of this woman, from whose barbarity she\nhad no resource; and, seeing no other possibility of redress than that\nof appealing to the good offices of Fathom, she conquered her\nreluctance so far, as to complain to him of Madam la Mer’s incivility.Pleased with this application, he gave her to understand, with very\nlittle ceremony or preamble, that it wholly depended upon herself\nwhether she should continue to be wretched, or be delivered at once\nfrom all her cares and perplexity; that, notwithstanding the disdain\nwith which she had treated his addresses, he was still ready to lay\nhimself and his fortune at her feet; and that, if she should again\nreject the disinterested proposal, the whole world and her own\nconscience would charge upon herself whatever calamities she might be\nsubjected to in the sequel. Interpreting into a favourable hesitation\nher silence, which was the result of wrath and amazement, he proceeded\nto throw himself at her feet, and utter a romantic rhapsody, in the\ncourse of which, laying aside all that restraint which he had hitherto\npreserved, he seized her delicate hand, and pressed it to his lips;\nnay, so far did he forget himself on this occasion, that he caught the\nfair creature in his arms, and rudely ravished a kiss from those lips\nwhich he had before contemplated with the most distant reverence of\ndesire.Having thus broken down the fences of decorum, and being heated with\ntransport, he, in all probability, would have acted the part of young\nTarquin, and violated by force that sacred shrine of honour, beauty,\nand unblemished truth, had not the wrath kindled by such an unexpected\noutrage inspired her with strength and spirits sufficient to protect\nher virtue, and intimidate the ruffian who could offer violence to such\nperfection. She broke from his detested embrace with surprising\nagility, and called aloud to her landlady for assistance; but that\ndiscreet matron was resolved to hear nothing, and Fathom’s appetite\nbeing whetted to a most brutal degree of eagerness, “Madam,” said he,\n“all opposition is vain. What you have refused to my entreaties, you\nshall yield to my power; and I am determined to force you to your own\nadvantage.”"

These were\ndreadful reflections to a young lady who had been born to affluence and\nsplendour, trained up in all the elegance of education, by nature\nfraught with that sensibility which refines the sentiment and taste,\nand so tenderly cherished by her indulgent parents, that they suffered\nnot the winds of Heaven to visit her face too roughly."

Thus attended, the hapless mourner entered the\nplace, and, according to the laudable hospitality of England, which is\nthe only country in Christendom where a stranger is not made welcome to\nthe house of God, this amiable creature, emaciated and enfeebled as she\nwas, must have stood in a common passage during the whole service, had\nnot she been perceived by a humane gentlewoman, who, struck with her\nbeauty and dignified air, and melted with sympathy at the ineffable\nsorrow which was visible in her countenance, opened the pew in which\nshe sat, and accommodated Monimia and her attendant. If she was\ncaptivated by her first appearance, she was not less affected by the\ndeportment of her fair guest, which was the pattern of genuine\ndevotion.In a word, this good lady, who was a merchant’s widow in opulent\ncircumstances, was inflamed with a longing desire to know and befriend\nthe amiable stranger, who, after service, turning about to thank her\nfor her civility, Madam Clement, with that frankness which is the\nresult of true benevolence, told her, she was too much prepossessed in\nher favour to let slip this opportunity of craving her acquaintance,\nand of expressing her inclination to alleviate, if possible, that\naffliction which was manifest in her looks.Monimia, overwhelmed with gratitude and surprise at this unexpected\naddress, gazed upon the lady in silence, and when she repeated her\ntenders of service, could make no other reply to her goodness, than by\nbursting into a flood of tears. This was a species of eloquence which\ndid not pass unregarded by Madam Clement, who, while her own eyes were\nbedewed with the drops of sympathy and compassion, took the lovely\norphan by the hand, and led her, without further ceremony, to her own\ncoach, that stood waiting at the door, whither they were followed by\nMrs. la Mer, who was so much confounded at the adventure, that she made\nno objections to the proposal of the lady, who handed her lodger into\nthe carriage; but retired, with all possible despatch, to make Fathom\nacquainted with this unforeseen event."

  "content": "Meanwhile the agitation of Monimia, at this providential deliverance,\nwas such as had well-nigh destroyed her tender frame. The blood flushed\nand forsook her cheeks by turns; she trembled from head to foot,\nnotwithstanding the consolatory assurances of Madam Clement, and,\nwithout being able to utter one word, was conducted to the house of\nthat kind benefactress, where the violence of her transports\noverpowered her constitution, and she sunk down upon a couch in a\nswoon, from which she was not easily recovered. This affecting\ncircumstance augmented the pity, and interested the curiosity of Madam\nClement, who concluded there was something very extraordinary in the\ncase of the stranger, to produce these agonies; and grew impatient to\nhear the particulars of her story.Monimia no sooner retrieved the use of her faculties, than looking\naround, and observing with what humane concern her new hostess was\nemployed in effecting her recovery, “Is this,” said she, “a flattering\nillusion of the brain? or am I really under the protection of some\nbeneficent being, whom Heaven hath inspired with generosity to rescue\nan hapless stranger from the most forlorn state of misery and woe?” Her\nvoice was at all times ravishingly sweet; and this exclamation was\npronounced with such pathetic fervour, that Madam Clement clasped her\nin her arms, and kissing her with all the eagerness of maternal\naffection, “Yes,” cried she, “fair creature, Heaven hath bestowed upon\nme an heart to compassionate, and power, I hope, to lighten the burden\nof your sorrows.”She then prevailed upon her to take some nourishment, and afterwards to\nrecount the particulars of her fate; a task she performed with such\naccuracy and candour, that Madam Clement, far from suspecting her\nsincerity, saw truth and conviction in every circumstance of her tale;\nand, having condoled her misfortunes, entreated her to forget them, or\nat least look upon herself as one sheltered under the care and tuition\nof a person whose study it would be to supply her want of natural\nparents. This would have been an happy vicissitude of fortune, had it\nnot arrived too late; but such a sudden and unlooked-for transition not\nonly disordered the faculties of poor Monimia’s mind, but also\noverpowered the organs of her body, already fatigued and enfeebled by\nthe distresses she had undergone; so that she was taken ill of a fever\nthat same night, and became delirious before morning, when a physician\nwas called to her assistance."

The good lady, although a little staggered\nat the genteel appearance and engaging address of this stranger, could\nnot prevail upon herself to believe that she had been imposed upon by\nher fair lodger, who by this time had given too convincing a proof of\nher sincerity; nevertheless, in order to prevent any dispute that might\nbe prejudicial to the health or recovery of Monimia, she gave him to\nunderstand, that she would not at present enter upon the merits of the\ncause, but only assure him, that the young lady was actually bereft of\nher senses, and in imminent danger of her life; for the truth of which\nassertions she would appeal to his own observation, and the opinion of\nthe physician, who was then employed in writing a prescription for the\ncure of her disease.So saying, she conducted him into the chamber, where he beheld the\nhapless virgin stretched upon a sick-bed, panting under the violence of\na distemper too mighty for her weakly frame, her hair dishevelled, and\ndiscomposure in her looks; all the roses of her youth were faded, yet\nall the graces of her beauty were not fled. She retained that sweetness\nand symmetry, which death itself could not destroy; and though her\ndiscourse was incoherent, her voice was still musical, resembling those\nfeathered songsters who warble their native wood-notes wild.Fathom, as upon all other occasions, so on this, did behave like an\ninimitable actor; he ran to the bedside, with all the trepidation of a\ndistracted lover; he fell upon his knees, and, while the tears rolled\ndown his cheeks, imprinted a thousand kisses on the soft hand of\nMonimia, who regarding him with a lack-lustre and undistinguishing eye,\n“Alas! Renaldo,” said she, “we were born to be unhappy.” “Would to\nHeaven,” cried Ferdinand, in a transport of grief, “the wretch Renaldo\nhad never been born! that is the villain who seduced the affection of\nthis unfortunate woman. I admitted the traitor into my friendship and\nconfidence, relieved him in his necessities; and, like the ungrateful\nviper, he hath stung the very bosom that cherished him in his\ndistress.” Then he proceeded to inform Madam Clement how he had\ndelivered that same Renaldo from prison, maintained him afterwards at a\ngreat expense, and at length furnished him with a sum of money and\nproper credentials to support his interest at the Court of Vienna."

He also\nthanked Madam Clement for her charity and benevolence towards a\nstranger, and took his leave with many polite professions of gratitude\nand esteem. He had no sooner quitted the house, than the physician, who\nwas a humane man, and a foreigner, began to caution the lady against\nhis insinuations, observing, that some circumstances of the story\nconcerning Renaldo were, to his particular knowledge, contrary to\ntruth; for that he himself had been applied to for letters of\nrecommendation in behalf of Count Melvil, by a Jew merchant of his\nacquaintance, who had supplied the young gentleman with money\nsufficient for his occasions, in consequence of a minute inquiry he had\nmade into the character of Renaldo, who was, by all reports, a youth of\nstrict honour and untainted morals.Madam Clement, thus cautioned, entered into deliberation with her own\nthoughts, and, comparing the particulars of this account with those of\nMonimia’s own story, she concluded that Fathom was the very traitor he\nhimself had described; and that he had, by abusing the confidence of\nboth, effected a fatal breach between two innocent and deserving\nlovers. She accordingly looked upon him with horror and detestation;\nbut nevertheless resolved to treat him with civility in the meantime,\nthat the poor young lady might not be disturbed in her last moments;\nfor she had now lost all hopes of her recovery. Yet the fever abated,\nand in two days she retrieved the use of her reason; though the\ndistemper had affected her lungs, and she was in all appearance doomed\nto linger a few weeks longer in a consumption.Fathom was punctual in his visitation, though never admitted into her\npresence after the delirium vanished; and he had the opportunity of\nseeing her conveyed in a chariot to Kensington Gravel Pits, a place\nwhich may be termed the last stage of many a mortal peregrination. He\nnow implicitly believed that death would in a few days baffle all his\ndesigns upon the unfortunate Monimia; and foreseeing that, as he had\nowned himself her husband, he might be obliged to defray the expenses\nincurred by her sickness and burial, he very prudently intermitted in\nhis visits, and had recourse to the intelligence of his auxiliary.As for Monimia, she approached the goal of life, not simply with\nresignation, but with rapture. She enjoyed in tranquillity the\nconversation of her kind benefactress, who never stirred from her\napartment; she was blessed with the spiritual consolation of a worthy\nclergyman, who removed all her religious scruples; and she\ncongratulated herself on the near prospect of that land of peace where\nsorrow is not known."
