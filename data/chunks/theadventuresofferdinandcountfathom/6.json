  "content": "Wretch that I am! to survive the loss of such an excellent woman,\nendeared to my remembrance by the most tender offices of wedlock,\nhappily exercised for the space of five-and-twenty years! Forgive these\ntears; they are not the drops of weakness, but remorse. Not to trouble\nyou with idle particulars, suffice it is to say, I was favoured with\nsuch marks of distinction by Madame d’Orgullo, that she thought it\nincumbent upon her to let me know she had not overacted her\nhospitality, and, while we sat at table, accosted me in these words:\n“You will not be surprised, Don Diego, at my expressions of regard,\nwhich I own are unusual from a Spanish lady to a young cavalier like\nyou, when I communicate the contents of this letter from Don Gonzales.”\nSo saying, she put the billet into my hand, and I read these words, or\nwords to this effect:—“AMIABLE ESTIFANIA,—You will understand that I am as well as a person\ncan possibly be who hath this day lived to see the army of his king\ndefeated. If you would know the particulars of this unfortunate action,\nyour curiosity will be gratified by the bearer, Don Diego de Zelos, to\nwhose virtue and bravery I am twice indebted for my life. I therefore\ndesire you will receive him with that respect and gratitude which you\nshall think due for such an obligation; and, in entertaining him,\ndismiss that reserve which often disgraces the Spanish hospitality. In\na word, let your own virtue and beneficence conduct you upon this\noccasion, and let my Antonia’s endeavours be joined with your own in\ndoing honour to the preserver of her father! Adieu.”Such a testimonial could not fail of being very agreeable to a young\nsoldier, who by this time had begun to indulge the transporting hope of\nbeing happy in the arms of the adorable Antonia. I professed myself\nextremely happy in having met with an opportunity of acquiring such a\ndegree of my colonel’s esteem, entertained them with a detail of his\npersonal prowess in the battle, and answered all their questions with\nthat moderation which every man ought to preserve in speaking of his\nown behaviour. Our repast being ended, I took my leave of the ladies,\nand at parting received a letter from Donna Estifania to her husband,\ntogether with a ring of great value, which she begged I would accept,\nas a token of her esteem. Thus loaded with honour and caresses, I set\nout on my return for the quarters of Don Gonzales, who could scarce\ncredit his own eyes when I delivered his lady’s billet; for he thought\nit impossible to perform such a journey in so short a time."

  "content": "When he had glanced over the paper, “Don Diego,” said he, “by your\nshort stay one would imagine you had met with indifferent reception at\nmy house. I hope Estifania has not been deficient in her duty?” I\nanswered this question, by assuring him my entertainment had been so\nagreeable in all respects, that nothing but my duty to him could have\ninduced me to give it up so soon. He then turned the conversation upon\nAntonia, and hinted his intention of giving her in marriage to a young\ncavalier, for whom he had a particular friendship. I was so much\naffected by this insinuation, which seemed at once to blast all my\nhopes of love and happiness, that the blood forsook my face; I was\nseized with an universal trepidation, and even obliged to retire, on\npretence of being suddenly taken ill.Though Gonzales seemed to impute this disorder to fatigue and want of\nrest, he in his heart ascribed it to the true cause; and, after having\nsounded my sentiments to his own satisfaction, blessed me with a\ndeclaration, importing, that I was the person upon whom he had pitched\nfor a son-in-law. I will not trouble you with a repetition of what\npassed on this interesting occasion, but proceed to observe, that his\nintention in my favour was far from being disagreeable to his lady; and\nthat, in a little time, I had the good fortune to espouse the charming\nAntonia, who submitted to the will of her father without reluctance.Soon after this happy event, I was, by the influence of Don Gonzales,\njoined to my own interest, promoted to the command of a regiment, and\nserved with honour during the remaining part of the war. After the\ntreaty of Utrecht, I was employed in reducing the Catalans to their\nallegiance; and, in an action with those obstinate rebels had the\nmisfortune to lose my father-in-law, who by that time was preferred to\nthe rank of a major-general. The virtuous Estifania did not long\nsurvive this melancholy accident; and the loss of these indulgent\nparents made such a deep impression upon the tender heart of my\nAntonia, that I took the first opportunity of removing her from a place\nin which every object served to cherish her grief, to a pleasant villa\nnear the city of Seville, which I purchased on account of its agreeable\nsituation. That I might the more perfectly enjoy the possession of my\namiable partner, who could no longer brook the thoughts of another\nseparation, peace was no sooner re-established than I obtained leave to\nresign my commission, and I wholly devoted myself to the joys of a\ndomestic life."

  "content": "Heaven seemed to smile upon our union, by blessing us with a son, whom,\nhowever, it was pleased to recall in his infancy, to our unspeakable\ngrief and mortification; but our mutual chagrin was afterwards\nalleviated by the birth of a daughter, who seemed born with every\naccomplishment to excite the love and admiration of mankind. Why did\nnature debase such a masterpiece with the mixture of an alloy, which\nhath involved herself and her whole family in perdition? But the ways\nof Providence are unsearchable. She hath paid the debt of her\ndegeneracy; peace be with her soul! The honour of my family is\nvindicated; though by a sacrifice which hath robbed me of everything\nelse that is valuable in life, and ruined my peace past all redemption.\nYes, my friend, all the tortures that human tyranny can inflict would\nbe ease, tranquillity, and delight, to the unspeakable pangs and\nhorrors I have felt.But, to return from this digression.—Serafina, which was the name of\nthat little darling, as she grew up, not only disclosed all the natural\ngraces of external beauty, but likewise manifested the most engaging\nsweetness of disposition, and a capacity for acquiring with ease all\nthe accomplishments of her sex. It is impossible to convey any adequate\nidea of a parent’s raptures in the contemplation of such a fair\nblossom. She was the only pledge of our love, she was presumptive\nheiress to a large fortune, and likely to be the sole representative of\ntwo noble Castilian families. She was the delight of all who saw her,\nand a theme of praise for every tongue. You are not to suppose that the\neducation of such a child was neglected. Indeed, it wholly engrossed\nthe attention of me and my Antonia, and her proficiency rewarded our\ncare. Before she had attained the age of fifteen, she was mistress of\nevery elegant qualification, natural and acquired. Her person was, by\nthat time, the confessed pattern of beauty. Her voice was enchantingly\nsweet, and she touched the lute with the most ravishing dexterity.\nHeaven and earth! how did my breast dilate with joy at the thoughts of\nhaving given birth to such perfection! how did my heart gush with\npaternal fondness, whenever I beheld this ornament of my name! and what\nscenes of endearing transport have I enjoyed with my Antonia, in mutual\ncongratulation upon our parental happiness!"

  "content": "Serafina, accomplished as she was, could not fail to make conquests\namong the Spanish cavaliers, who are famous for sensibility in love.\nIndeed, she never appeared without a numerous train of admirers; and\nthough we had bred her up in that freedom of conversation and\nintercourse which holds a middle space between the French licence and\nSpanish restraint, she was now so much exposed to the addresses of\npromiscuous gallantry, that we found it necessary to retrench the\nliberty of our house, and behave to our male visitants with great\nreserve and circumspection, that our honour and peace might run no risk\nfrom the youth and inexperience of our daughter.This caution produced overtures from a great many young gentlemen of\nrank and distinction, who courted my alliance, by demanding Serafina in\nmarriage; and from the number I had actually selected one person, who\nwas in all respects worthy the possession of such an inestimable prize.\nHis name was Don Manuel de Mendoza. His birth was noble, and his\ncharacter dignified with repeated acts of generosity and virtue. Yet,\nbefore I would signify to him my approbation of his suit, I resolved to\ninform myself whether or not the heart of Serafina was totally\nunengaged, and indifferent to any other object, that I might not lay a\ntyrannical restraint upon her inclinations. The result of my inquiry\nwas a full conviction of her having hitherto been deaf to the voice of\nlove; and this piece of information, together with my own sentiments in\nhis favour, I communicated to Don Manuel, who heard these tidings with\ntransports of gratitude and joy. He was immediately favoured with\nopportunities of acquiring the affection of my daughter, and his\nendeavours were at first received with such respectful civility, as\nmight have been easily warmed into a mutual passion, had not the evil\ngenius of our family interposed.O my friend! how shall I describe the depravity of that unhappy\nvirgin’s sentiments! how recount the particulars of my own dishonour! I\nthat am descended from a long line of illustrious Castilians, who never\nreceived an injury they did not revenge, but washed away every blemish\nin their fame with the blood of those who attempted to stain it! In\nthat circumstance I have imitated the example of my glorious\nprogenitors, and that consideration alone hath supported me against all\nthe assaults of despair."

  "content": "As I grudged no pains and expense in perfecting the education of\nSerafina, my doors were open to every person who made an extraordinary\nfigure in the profession of those amusing sciences in which she\ndelighted. The house of Don Diego de Zelos was a little academy for\npainting, poetry, and music; and Heaven decreed that it should fall a\nsacrifice to its regard for these fatal and delusive arts. Among other\npreceptors, it was her fate to be under the instruction of a cursed\nGerman, who, though his profession was drawing, understood the elements\nand theory of music, possessed a large fund of learning and taste, and\nwas a person remarkable for his agreeable conversation. This traitor,\nwho like you had lost one eye, I not only admitted into my house for\nthe improvement of my daughter, but even distinguished with particular\nmarks of confidence and favour, little thinking he had either\ninclination or capacity to debauch the sentiments of my child. I was\nrejoiced beyond measure to see with what alacrity she received his\nlessons, with what avidity she listened to his discourse, which was\nalways equally moral, instructing, and entertaining.Antonia seemed to vie with me in expressions of regard for this\naccomplished stranger, whom she could not help supposing to be a person\nof rank and family, reduced to his present situation by some\nunfortunate vicissitude of fate. I was disposed to concur with this\nopinion, and actually conjured him to make me his confidant, with such\nprotestations as left him no room to doubt my honour and beneficence;\nbut he still persisted in declaring himself the son of an obscure\nmechanic in Bohemia; an origin to which surely no man would pretend who\nhad the least claim to nobility of birth. While I was thus undeceived\nin my conjecture touching his birth and quality, I was confirmed in an\nopinion of his integrity and moderation, and looked upon him as a man\nof honour, in despite of the lowness of his pedigree. Nevertheless, he\nwas at bottom a most perfidious wretch, and all this modesty and\nself-denial were the effects of the most villanous dissimulation, a\ncloak under which he, unsuspected, robbed me of my honour and my peace.Not to trouble you with particulars, the recital of which would tear my\nheart-strings with indignation and remorse, I shall only observe, that,\nby the power of his infernal insinuation, he fascinated the heart of\nSerafina, brought over Antonia herself to the interests of his passion,\nand at once detached them both from their duty and religion. Heaven and\nearth! how dangerous, how irresistible is the power of infatuation!\nWhile I remained in the midst of this blind security, waiting for the\nnuptials of my daughter, and indulging myself with the vain prospect of\nher approaching felicity, Antonia found means to protract the\nnegotiations of the marriage, by representing that it would be a pity\nto deprive Serafina of the opportunity she then had of profiting by the\nGerman’s instructions; and, upon that account, I prevailed upon Don\nManuel to bridle the impatience of his love."

  "content": "During this interval, as I one evening enjoyed the cool air in my own\ngarden, I was accosted by an old duenna, who had been my nurse and\nlived in the family since the time of my childhood.—“My duty,” said\nshe, “will no longer permit me to wink in silence at the wrongs I see\nyou daily suffer. Dismiss that German from your house without delay, if\nyou respect the glory of your name, and the rights of our holy\nreligion; the stranger is an abominable heretic; and, grant Heaven! he\nmay not have already poisoned the minds of those you hold most dear.” I\nhad been extremely alarmed at the beginning of this address; but,\nfinding the imputation limited to the article of religion, in which,\nthank God, I am no bigot, I recovered my serenity of disposition,\nthanked the old woman for her zeal, commended her piety, and encouraged\nher to persevere in making observations on such subjects as should\nconcern my honour and my quiet.We live in such a world of wickedness and fraud, that a man cannot be\ntoo vigilant in his own defence: had I employed such spies from the\nbeginning, I should in all probability have been at this day in\npossession of every comfort that renders life agreeable. The duenna,\nthus authorised, employed her sagacity with such success, that I had\nreason to suspect the German of a design upon the heart of Serafina;\nbut, as the presumptions did not amount to conviction, I contented\nmyself with exiling him from my house, under the pretext of having\ndiscovered that he was an enemy to the Catholic church; and forthwith\nappointed a day for the celebration of my daughter’s marriage with Don\nManuel de Mendoza. I could easily perceive a cloud of melancholy\noverspread the faces of Serafina and her mother, when I declared these\nmy resolutions; but, as they made no objection to what I proposed, I\ndid not at that time enter into an explanation of the true motives that\ninfluenced my conduct. Both parties were probably afraid of such\nexpostulation.Meanwhile, preparations were made for the espousals of Serafina; and,\nnotwithstanding the anxiety I had undergone, on account of her\nconnexion with the German, I began to think that her duty, her glory,\nhad triumphed over all such low-born considerations, if ever they had\nbeen entertained; because she, and even Antonia, seemed to expect the\nceremony with resignation, though the features of both still retained\nevident marks of concern, which I willingly imputed to the mutual\nprospect of their separation. This, however, was but a faithless calm,\nthat soon, ah! too soon, brought forth a tempest which hath wrecked my\nhopes."

I could not\nhelp shivering with fearful presages upon this occasion, and even\nabhorring the person to whose duty and zeal I was beholden for the\nintelligence, even while I endeavoured to persuade myself that the\ninquiry would end in the detection of some paltry intrigue between the\nmaid and her own gallant. I intercepted her in returning from church,\nand, commanding her to follow me to a convenient place, extorted from\nher, by dint of threats, the fatal letter, which I read to this\neffect:—“The whole business of my life, O divine Serafina! will be to repay\nthat affection I have been so happy as to engage. With what transport\nthen shall I obey your summons, in performing that enterprise, which\nwill rescue you from the bed of a detested rival, and put myself in\nfull possession of a jewel which I value infinitely more than life!\nYes, adorable creature! I have provided everything for our escape, and\nat midnight will attend you in your own apartment, from whence you\nshall be conveyed into a land of liberty and peace, where you will,\nunmolested, enjoy the purity of that religion you have espoused, and in\nfull security bless the arms of your ever faithful, ORLANDO.”Were you a fond parent, a tender husband, and a noble Castilian, I\nshould not need to mention the unutterable horrors that took possession\nof my bosom, when I perused this accursed letter, by which I learned\nthe apostasy, disobedience, and degeneracy of my idolised Serafina, who\nhad overthrown and destroyed the whole plan of felicity which I had\nerected, and blasted all the glories of my name; and when the wretched\nmessenger, terrified by my menaces and agitation, confessed that\nAntonia herself was privy to the guilt of her daughter, whom she had\nsolemnly betrothed to that vile German, in the sight of Heaven, and\nthat by her connivance this plebeian intended, that very night, to\nbereave me of my child, I was for some moments stupefied with grief and\namazement, that gave way to an ecstasy of rage, which had well-nigh\nterminated in despair and distraction."

Behold how the drops trickle down my forehead; this\nagony is a fierce and familiar visitant; I shall banish it anon. I\nsummoned my pride, my resentment, to my assistance; these are the\ncordials that support me against all other reflections; those were the\nauxiliaries that enabled me, in the day of trial, to perform that\nsacrifice which my honour demanded, in a strain so loud as to drown the\ncries of nature, love, and compassion. Yes, they espoused that glory\nwhich humanity would have betrayed, and my revenge was noble, though\nunnatural.My scheme was soon laid, my resolution soon taken; I privately confined\nthe wretch who had been the industrious slave of this infamous\nconspiracy, that she might take no step to frustrate or interrupt the\nexecution of my design. Then repairing to the house of an apothecary\nwho was devoted to my service, communicated my intention, which he\ndurst not condemn, and could not reveal, without breaking the oath of\nsecrecy I had imposed; and he furnished me with two vials of poison for\nthe dismal catastrophe I had planned. Thus provided, I, on pretence of\nsudden business at Seville, carefully avoided the dear, the wretched\npair, whom I had devoted to death, that my heart might not relent, by\nmeans of those tender ideas which the sight of them would have\ninfallibly inspired; and, when daylight vanished, took my station near\nthat part of the house through which the villain must have entered on\nhis hellish purpose. There I stood, in a state of horrid expectation,\nmy soul ravaged with the different passions that assailed it, until the\nfatal moment arrived; when I perceived the traitor approach the window\nof a lower apartment, which led into that of Serafina, and gently\nlifting the casement, which was purposely left unsecured, insinuated\nhalf of his body into the house. Then rushing upon him, in a transport\nof fury, I plunged my sword into his heart, crying, “Villain! receive\nthe reward of thy treachery and presumption.”"

O my dear lord! my husband, and\nmy lover! how are our promised joys at once cut off! here, strike, my\nfather! complete your barbarous sacrifice! the spirit of the murdered\nOrlando still hovers for his wife.” These frantic exclamations, in\nwhich she was joined by Antonia, kept up the fury of my resentment,\nwhich by meekness and submission might have been weakened and rendered\nineffectual. “Yes, hapless wretches,” I replied, “ye shall enjoy your\nwish: the honour of my name requires that both shall die; yet I will\nnot mangle the breast of Antonia, on which I have so often reposed; I\nwill not shed the blood of Zelos, nor disfigure the beauteous form of\nSerafina, on which I have so often gazed with wonder and unspeakable\ndelight. Here is an elixir, to which I trust the consummation of my\nrevenge.”So saying, I emptied the vials into separate cups, and, presenting one\nin each hand, the miserable, the fair offenders instantly received the\ndestined draughts, which they drank without hesitation; then praying to\nheaven for the wretched Don Diego, sunk upon the same couch, and\nexpired without a groan.

Powers supreme! does Don Diego\nlive to make this recapitulation? I have done my duty; but ah! I am\nhaunted by the furies of remorse; I am tortured with the incessant\nstings of remembrance and regret; even now the images of my wife and\ndaughter present themselves to my imagination. All the scenes of\nhappiness I have enjoyed as a lover, husband, and parent, all the\nendearing hopes I have cherished, now pass in review before me,\nembittering the circumstances of my inexpressible woe; and I consider\nmyself as a solitary outcast from all the comforts of society. But,\nenough of these unmanly complaints; the yearnings of nature are too\nimportunate.Having completed my vengeance, I retired into my closet, and,\nfurnishing myself with some ready money and jewels of considerable\nvalue, went into the stable, saddled my favourite steed, which I\ninstantly mounted, and, before the tumults of my breast subsided, found\nmyself at the town of St. Lucar. There I learned from inquiry, that\nthere was a Dutch bark in the harbour ready to sail; upon which I\naddressed myself to the master, who, for a suitable gratification, was\nprevailed upon to weigh anchor that same night; so that, embarking\nwithout delay, I soon bid eternal adieu to my native country. It was\nnot from reason and reflection that I took these measures for my\npersonal safety; but, in consequence of an involuntary instinct, that\nseems to operate in the animal machine, while the faculty of thinking\nis suspended.To what a dreadful reckoning was I called, when reason resumed her\nfunction! You may believe me, my friend, when I assure you, that I\nshould not have outlived those tragedies I acted, had I not been\nrestrained from doing violence upon myself by certain considerations,\nwhich no man of honour ought to set aside. I could not bear the thought\nof falling ingloriously by the hand of an executioner, and entailing\ndisgrace upon a family that knew no stain; and I was deterred from\nputting an end to my own misery, by the apprehension of posthumous\ncensure, which would have represented me as a desponding wretch,\nutterly destitute of that patience, fortitude, and resignation, which\nare the characteristics of a true Castilian. I was also influenced by\nreligious motives that suggested to me the necessity of living to\natone, by my sufferings and sorrow, for the guilt I had incurred in\ncomplying with a savage punctilio, which is, I fear, displeasing in the\nsight of Heaven."

In consequence of unfavourable winds, our\nvessel for some days made small progress in her voyage to Holland, and\nnear the coast of Gallicia we were joined by an English ship from Vigo,\nthe master of which gave us to understand, that before he set sail, a\ncourier had arrived from Madrid at that place, with orders for the\ncorregidore to prevent the escape of any native Spaniard by sea from\nany port within his district; and to use his utmost endeavours to\napprehend the person of Don Diego de Zelos, who was suspected of\ntreasonable practices against the state. Such an order, with a minute\ndescription of my person, was at the same time despatched to all the\nseaports and frontier places in Spain.You may easily suppose how I, who was already overwhelmed with\ndistress, could bear this aggravation of misfortune and disgrace: I,\nwho had always maintained the reputation of loyalty, which was acquired\nat the hazard of my life, and the expense of my blood. To deal\ncandidly, I must own, that this intelligence roused me from a lethargy\nof grief which had begun to overpower my faculties.

Those were literally\ntears of joy, or at least of satisfaction, on both sides; as our hero\nwept with affection and attachment to the jewels that were to be\ncommitted to his care; but, far from discovering the true source of his\ntenderness, he affected to dissuade the Spaniard from parting with the\ndiamonds, which he counselled him to reserve for a more pressing\noccasion; and, in the meantime, earnestly entreated him to depend upon\nhis friendship for present relief.This generous proffer served only to confirm Don Diego’s resolution,\nwhich he forthwith executed, by putting into the hands of Ferdinand\njewels to the value of a thousand crowns, and desiring him to detain\nfor his own use any part of the sum they would raise. Our adventurer\nthanked him for the good opinion he entertained of his integrity, an\nopinion fully manifested in honouring him with such important\nconfidence, and assured him he would transact his affairs with the\nutmost diligence, caution, and despatch. The evening being by this time\nalmost consumed, these new allies retired separately to rest; though\neach passed the night without repose, in very different reflections,\nthe Castilian being, as usual, agitated with the unceasing pangs of his\nunalterable misery, interspersed with gleaming hopes of revenge; and\nFathom being kept awake with revolving plans for turning his\nfellow-lodger’s credulity to his own advantage. From the nature of the\nSpaniard’s situation, he might have appropriated the jewels to himself,\nand remained in Paris without fear of a prosecution, because the\ninjured party had, by the above narrative, left his life and liberty at\ndiscretion.—But he did not think himself secure from the personal\nresentment of an enraged desperate Castilian; and therefore determined\nto withdraw himself privately into that country where he had all along\nproposed to fix the standard of his finesse, which fortune had now\nempowered him to exercise according to his wish."

  "content": "Bent upon this retreat, he went abroad in the morning, on pretence of\nacting in the concerns of his friend Don Diego, and having hired a\npost-chaise to be ready at the dawning of next day, returned to his\nlodgings, where he cajoled the Spaniard with a feigned report of his\nnegotiation; then, securing his most valuable effects about his person,\narose with the cock, repaired to the place at which he had appointed to\nmeet the postillion with the carriage, and set out for England without\nfurther delay, leaving the unhappy Zelos to the horrors of indigence,\nand the additional agony of this fresh disappointment. Yet he was not\nthe only person affected by the abrupt departure of Fathom, which was\nhastened by the importunities, threats, and reproaches of his\nlandlord’s daughter, whom he had debauched under promise of marriage,\nand now left in the fourth month of her pregnancy.Notwithstanding the dangerous adventure in which he had been formerly\ninvolved by travelling in the night, he did not think proper to make\nthe usual halts on this journey, for sleep or refreshment, nor did he\nonce quit the chaise till his arrival at Boulogne, which he reached in\ntwenty hours after his departure from Paris. Here he thought he might\nsafely indulge himself with a comfortable meal; accordingly he bespoke\na poulard for dinner, and while that was preparing, went forth to view\nthe city and harbour. When he beheld the white cliffs of Albion, his\nheart throbbed with all the joy of a beloved son, who, after a tedious\nand fatiguing voyage, reviews the chimneys of his father’s house. He\nsurveyed the neighbouring coast of England with fond and longing eyes,\nlike another Moses, reconnoitring the land of Canaan from the top of\nMount Pisgah; and to such a degree of impatience was he inflamed by the\nsight, that, instead of proceeding to Calais, he resolved to take his\npassage directly from Boulogne, even if he should hire a vessel for the\npurpose. With these sentiments, he inquired if there was any ship bound\nfor England, and was so fortunate as to find the master of a small\nbark, who intended to weigh anchor for Deal that same evening at high\nwater."

  "content": "Transported with this information, he immediately agreed for his\npassage, sold the post-chaise to his landlord for thirty guineas, as a\npiece of furniture for which he could have no further use, purchased a\nportmanteau, together with some linen and wearing apparel, and, at the\nrecommendation of his host, took into his service an extra postillion\nor helper, who had formerly worn the livery of a travelling marquis.\nThis new domestic, whose name was Maurice, underwent, with great\napplause, the examination of our hero, who perceived in him a fund of\nsagacity and presence of mind, by which he was excellently qualified\nfor being the valet of an adventurer. He was therefore accommodated\nwith a second-hand suit and another shirt, and at once listed under the\nbanners of Count Fathom, who spent the whole afternoon in giving him\nproper instructions for the regulation of his conduct.Having settled these preliminaries to his own satisfaction, he and his\nbaggage were embarked about six o’clock in the month of September, and\nit was not without emotion that he found himself benighted upon the\ngreat deep, of which, before the preceding day, he had never enjoyed\neven the most distant prospect. However, he was not a man to be afraid,\nwhere there was really no appearance of danger; and the agreeable\npresages of future fortune supported his spirits, amidst the\ndisagreeable nausea which commonly attends landsmen at sea, until he\nwas set ashore upon the beach at Deal, which he entered in good health\nabout seven o’clock in the morning.Like Caesar, however, he found some difficulty in landing, on account\nof the swelling surf, that tumbled about with such violence as had\nalmost overset the cutter that carried him on shore; and, in his\neagerness to jump upon the strand, his foot slipped from the side of\nthe boat, so that he was thrown forwards in an horizontal direction,\nand his hands were the first parts of him that touched English ground.\nUpon this occasion, he, in imitation of Scipio’s behaviour on the coast\nof Africa, hailed the omen, and, grasping a handful of the sand, was\nheard to exclaim, in the Italian language: “Ah, ah, Old England, I have\nthee fast.”"

  "content": "As he walked up to the inn, followed by Maurice loaded with his\nportmanteau, he congratulated himself upon his happy voyage, and the\npeaceable possession of his spoil, and could not help snuffing up the\nBritish air with marks of infinite relish and satisfaction. His first\ncare was to recompense himself for the want of sleep he had undergone,\nand, after he had sufficiently recruited himself with several hours of\nuninterrupted repose, he set out in a post-chaise for Canterbury, where\nhe took a place in the London stage, which he was told would depart\nnext morning, the coach being already full. On this very first day of\nhis arrival, he perceived between the English and the people among whom\nhe had hitherto lived, such essential difference in customs,\nappearance, and way of living, as inspired him with high notions of\nthat British freedom, opulence, and convenience, on which he had often\nheard his mother expatiate. On the road, he feasted his eyesight with\nthe verdant hills covered with flocks of sheep, the fruitful vales\nparcelled out into cultivated enclosures; the very cattle seemed to\nprofit by the wealth of their masters, being large, sturdy, and sleek,\nand every peasant breathed the insolence of liberty and independence.\nIn a word, he viewed the wide-extended plains of Kent with a lover’s\neye, and, his ambition becoming romantic, could not help fancying\nhimself another conqueror of the isle.He was not, however, long amused by these vain chimeras, which soon\nvanished before other reflections of more importance and solidity. His\nimagination, it must be owned, was at all times too chaste to admit\nthose overweening hopes, which often mislead the mind of the projector.\nHe had studied mankind with incredible diligence, and knew perfectly\nwell how far he could depend on the passions and foibles of human\nnature. That he might now act consistent with his former sagacity, he\nresolved to pass himself upon his fellow-travellers for a French\ngentleman, equally a stranger to the language and country of England,\nin order to glean from their discourse such intelligence as might avail\nhim in his future operations; and his lacquey was tutored accordingly.CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTSOME ACCOUNT OF HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLERS.Those who had taken places for the coach, understanding the sixth seat\nwas engaged by a foreigner, determined to profit by his ignorance; and,\nwith that politeness which is peculiar to this happy island, fixed\nthemselves in the vehicle, in such a manner, before he had the least\nintimation of their design, that he found it barely practicable to\ninsinuate himself sidelong between a corpulent quaker and a fat Wapping\nlandlady, in which attitude he stuck fast, like a thin quarto between\ntwo voluminous dictionaries on a bookseller’s shelf. And, as if the\npain and inconvenience of such compression was not sufficient matter of\nchagrin, the greatest part of the company entertained themselves with\nlaughing at his ludicrous station."

  "content": "The jolly dame at his left hand observed, with a loud exclamation of\nmirth, that monsieur would be soon better acquainted with a buttock of\nEnglish beef; and said, by that time they should arrive at their\ndining-place, he might be spitted without larding. “Yes, verily,”\nreplied Obadiah, who was a wag in his way, “but the swine’s fat will be\nall on one side.”—“So much the better for you,” cried mine hostess,\n“for that side is all your own.” The quaker was not so much\ndisconcerted by the quickness of this repartee, but that he answered\nwith great deliberation, “I thank thee for thy love, but will not\nprofit by thy loss, especially as I like not the savour of these\noutlandish fowls; they are profane birds of passage, relished only by\nthe children of vanity, like thee.”The plump gentlewoman took umbrage at this last expression, which she\nconsidered as a double reproach, and repeated the words, “Children of\nvanity!” with an emphasis of resentment. “I believe, if the truth were\nknown,” said she, “there’s more vanity than midriff in that great belly\nof yours, for all your pretending to humility and religion. Sirrah! my\ncorporation is made up of good, wholesome, English fat; but you are\npuffed up with the wind of vanity and delusion; and when it begins to\ngripe your entrails, you pretend to have a motion, and then get up and\npreach nonsense. Yet you’ll take it upon you to call your betters\nchildren. Marry come up, Mr. Goosecap, I have got children that are as\ngood men as you, or any hypocritical trembler in England.”A person who sat opposite to the quaker, hearing this remonstrance,\nwhich seemed pregnant with contention, interposed in the conversation\nwith a conscious leer, and begged there might be no rupture between the\nspirit and the flesh. By this remonstrance he relieved Obadiah from the\nsatire of this female orator, and brought the whole vengeance of her\nelocution upon his own head. “Flesh!” cried she, with all the ferocity\nof an enraged Thalestris; “none of your names, Mr. Yellowchaps. What! I\nwarrant you have an antipathy to flesh, because you yourself are\nnothing but skin and bone. I suppose you are some poor starved\njourneyman tailor come from France, where you have been learning to\ncabbage, and have not seen a good meal of victuals these seven years.\nYou have been living upon rye-bread and soup-maigre, and now you come\nover like a walking atomy with a rat’s tail at your wig, and a tinsey\njacket. And so, forsooth, you set up for a gentleman, and pretend to\nfind fault with a sirloin of roast beef.”"

Since when, I pray, have you travelled in\nstage-coaches, and left off your old profession of crying oysters in\nwinter, and rotten mackerel in June? You was then known by the name of\nKate Brawn, and in good repute among the ale-houses in Thames Street,\ntill that unlucky amour with the master of a corn-vessel, in which he\nwas unfortunately detected by his own spouse; but you seem to have\nrisen by that fall; and I wish you joy of your present plight. Though,\nconsidering your education on Bear Quay, you can give but a sorry\naccount of yourself.”The Amazon, though neither exhausted nor dismayed, was really\nconfounded at the temper and assurance of this antagonist, who had\ngathered all these anecdotes from the fertility of his own invention;\nafter a short pause, however, she poured forth a torrent of obloquy\nsufficient to overwhelm any person who had not been used to take up\narms against such seas of trouble; and a dispute ensued, which would\nhave not only disgraced the best orators on the Thames, but even have\nmade a figure in the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, during\nwhich the Athenian matrons rallied one another from different waggons,\nwith that freedom of altercation so happily preserved in this our age\nand country."

  "content": "Such a redundancy of epithets, and variety of metaphors, tropes, and\nfigures were uttered between these well-matched opponents, that an epic\nbard would have found his account in listening to the contest; which,\nin all probability, would not have been confined to words, had it not\nbeen interrupted for the sake of a young woman of an agreeable\ncountenance and modest carriage; who, being shocked at some of their\nflowers of speech, and terrified by the menacing looks and gestures of\nthe fiery-featured dame, began to scream aloud, and beg leave to quit\nthe coach. Her perturbation put an end to the high debate. The sixth\npassenger, who had not opened his mouth, endeavoured to comfort her\nwith assurances of protection; the quaker proposed a cessation of arms;\nthe male disputant acquiesced in the proposal, assuring the company he\nhad entered the lists for their entertainment only, without acquiring\nthe least grudge or ill-will to the fat gentlewoman, whom he protested\nhe had never seen before that day, and who, for aught he knew, was a\nperson of credit and reputation. He then held forth his hand in token\nof amity, and asked pardon of the offended party, who was appeased by\nhis submission; and, in testimony of her benevolence, presented to the\nother female, whom she had discomposed, an Hungary-water bottle filled\nwith cherry-brandy, recommending it as a much more powerful remedy than\nthe sal-volatile which the other held to her nose.Peace being thus re-established, in a treaty comprehending Obadiah and\nall present, it will not be improper to give the reader some further\ninformation, touching the several characters assembled in this vehicle.\nThe quaker was a London merchant, who had been at Deal superintending\nthe repairs of a ship which had suffered by a storm in the Downs. The\nWapping landlady was on her return from the same place, where she had\nattended the payment of a man-of-war, with sundry powers of attorney,\ngranted by the sailors, who had lived upon credit at her house. Her\ncompetitor in fame was a dealer in wine, a smuggler of French lace, and\na petty gamester just arrived from Paris, in the company of an English\nbarber, who sat on his right hand, and the young woman was daughter of\na country curate, in her way to London, where she was bound apprentice\nto a milliner.Hitherto Fathom had sat in silent astonishment at the manners of his\nfellow-travellers, which far exceeded the notions he had preconceived\nof English plainness and rusticity. He found himself a monument of that\ndisregard and contempt which a stranger never fails to meet with from\nthe inhabitants of this island; and saw, with surprise, an agreeable\nyoung creature sit as solitary and unheeded as himself.He was, indeed, allured by the roses of her complexion, and the\ninnocence of her aspect, and began to repent of having pretended\nignorance of the language, by which he was restrained from exercising\nhis eloquence upon her heart; he resolved, however, to ingratiate\nhimself, if possible, by the courtesy and politeness of dumb show, and\nfor that purpose put his eyes in motion without farther delay.CHAPTER TWENTY-NINEANOTHER PROVIDENTIAL DELIVERANCE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE SMUGGLER’S\nINGENIOUS CONJECTURE."
