  "content": "Any man of humane sentiments, from the knowledge of these particulars,\nwould have been prompted to offer his services to the forlorn stranger;\nbut as our hero was devoid of all these infirmities of human nature, it\nwas necessary that other motives should produce the same effect. His\ncuriosity, therefore, joined with the hopes of converting the\nconfidence of Ali to his own emolument, effectually impelled him\ntowards his acquaintance; and, in a little time, they began to relish\nthe conversation of each other. For, as the reader may have already\nobserved, Fathom possessed all the arts of insinuation, and had\ndiscernment enough to perceive an air of dignity in the Persian, which\nthe humility of his circumstances could not conceal. He was, moreover,\na man of good understanding, not without a tincture of letters,\nperfectly well bred, though in a ceremonious style, extremely moral in\nhis discourse, and scrupulously nice in his notions of honour.Our hero conformed himself in all respects to the other’s opinions, and\nmanaged his discretion so as to pass upon him for a gentleman reduced\nby misfortunes to the exercise of an employment which was altogether\nunsuitable to his birth and quality. He made earnest and repeated\ntenders of his good offices to the stranger, and pressed him to make\nuse of his purse with such cordial perseverance, that, at length, Ali’s\nreserve was overcome, and he condescended to borrow of him a small sum,\nwhich in all probability, saved his life; for he had been driven to the\nutmost extremity of want before he would accept of this assistance.Fathom, having gradually stole into his good graces, began to take\nnotice of many piteous sighs that escaped him in the moments of their\nintercourse, and seemed to denote an heart fraught with woe; and, on\npretence of administering consolation and counsel, begged leave to know\nthe cause of his distress, observing, that his mind would be\ndisburdened by such communication, and, perhaps, his grief alleviated\nby some means which they might jointly concert and execute in his\nbehalf.Ali, thus solicited, would often shake his head, with marks of extreme\nsorrow and despondence, and, while the tears gushed from his eyes,\ndeclared that his distress was beyond the power of any remedy but\ndeath, and that, by making our hero his confidant, he should only\nextend his unhappiness to a friend, without feeling the least remission\nof his own torture. Notwithstanding these repeated declarations,\nFerdinand, who was well enough acquainted with the mind of man to know\nthat such importunity is seldom or never disagreeable, redoubled his\ninstances, together with his expressions of sympathy and esteem, until\nthe stranger was prevailed upon to gratify his curiosity and\nbenevolence. Having, therefore, secured the chamber door one night,\nwhile all the rest of the family were asleep, the unfortunate Ali\ndisclosed himself in these words.CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX"

I have felt your friendship,\nam confident of your honour, and though my misfortunes are such as can\nnever be repaired, because I am utterly cut off from hope, which is the\nwretch’s last comfort, yet I may, by your means, be enabled to bear\nthem with some degree of fortitude and resignation.Know then, my name is not Ali; neither am I of Persian extraction. I\nhad once the honour to own myself a Castilian, and was, under the\nappellation of Don Diego de Zelos, respected as the head of one of the\nmost ancient families of that kingdom. Judge, then, how severe that\ndistress must be, which compels a Spaniard to renounce his country, his\nhonours, and his name. My youth was not spent in inglorious ease,\nneither did it waste unheeded in the rolls of fame. Before I had\nattained the age of nineteen, I was twice wounded in battle. I once\nfortunately recovered the standard of the regiment to which I belonged,\nafter it had been seized by the enemy; and, at another occasion, made\nshift to save the life of my colonel, when he lay at the mercy of an\nenraged barbarian."

I mean only to do\njustice to my own character, and to make you acquainted with one of the\nmost remarkable incidents of my life. It was my fate, during my third\ncampaign, to command a troop of horse in the regiment of Don Gonzales\nOrgullo, between whom and my father a family feud had long been\nmaintained with great enmity; and that gentleman did not leave me\nwithout reason to believe he rejoiced at the opportunity of exercising\nhis resentment upon his adversary’s son; for he withheld from me that\ncountenance which my fellow-officers enjoyed, and found means to\nsubject me to divers mortifications, of which I was not at liberty to\ncomplain. These I bore in silence for some time, as part of my\nprobation in the character of a soldier; resolved, nevertheless, to\nemploy my interest at court for a removal into another corps, and to\ntake some future opportunity of explaining my sentiments to Don\nGonzales upon the injustice of his behaviour.While I animated myself with these sentiments against the\ndiscouragements I underwent, and the hard duty to which I was daily\nexposed, it was our fate to be concerned in the battle of Saragossa,\nwhere our regiment was so severely handled by the English infantry,\nthat it was forced to give ground with the loss of one half of its\nofficers and men. Don Gonzales, who acted as brigadier in another wing,\nbeing informed of our fate, and dreading the disgrace of his corps,\nwhich had never turned back to the enemy, put spurs to his horse, and,\nriding across the field at full speed, rallied our broken squadrons,\nand led us back to the charge with such intrepidity of behaviour, as\ndid not fail to inspire us all with uncommon courage and alacrity. For\nmy own part, I thought myself doubly interested to distinguish my\nvalour, not only on account of my own glory, but likewise on the\nsupposition, that, as I was acting under the eye of Gonzales, my\nconduct would be narrowly observed."

I even acquired his applause in the very\nheat of battle. When his hat was struck off, and his horse fell under\nhim, I accommodated and remounted him upon my own, and, having seized\nfor my own use another that belonged to a common trooper, attended this\nstern commander as before, and seconded him in all his repeated\nefforts; but it was impossible to withstand the numbers and impetuosity\nof the foe, and Don Gonzales having had the mortification to see his\nregiment cut in pieces, and the greatest part of the army routed, was\nfain to yield to the fortune of the day; yet he retired as became a man\nof honour and a Castilian; that is, he marched off with great\ndeliberation in the rear of the Spanish troops, and frequently faced\nabout to check the pursuit of the enemy. Indeed, this exercise of his\ncourage had well-nigh cost him his life; for, in one of those\nwheelings, he was left almost alone, and a small party of the\nPortuguese horse had actually cut off our communication with the\nretreating forces of Spain.In this dilemma, we had no other chance of saving our lives and\nliberty, than that of opening a passage sword in hand; and this was\nwhat Gonzales instantly resolved to attempt. We accordingly recommended\nour souls to God, and, charging the line abreast of one another, bore\ndown all opposition, and were in a fair way of accomplishing our\nretreat without further danger; but the gallant Orgullo, in crossing a\nditch, had the misfortune to be thrown from his horse, and was almost\nthe same instant overtaken by one of the Portuguese dragoons, whose\nsword was already suspended over his head, as he lay half stunned with\nhis fall; when I rode up, discharged a pistol in the ruffian’s brain,\nand, seating my colonel on his horse, had the good fortune to conduct\nhim to a place of safety.Here he was provided with such accommodation as his case required; for\nhe had been wounded in the battle, and dangerously bruised by his fall,\nand, when all the necessary steps were taken towards his recovery, I\ndesired to know if he had any further commands for his service, being\nresolved to join the army without delay. I thought proper to\ncommunicate this question by message, because he had not spoke one word\nto me during our retreat, notwithstanding the good office he had\nreceived at my hands; a reserve which I attributed to his pride, and\nresented accordingly. He no sooner understood my intention, than he\ndesired to see me in his apartment, and, as near as I can remember,\nspoke to this effect:—"

Yes, Don Diego, your virtue hath\ntriumphed over that enmity I bore your house, and I upbraid myself with\nthe ungenerous treatment you have suffered under my command. But it is\nnot enough for me to withdraw that rigour which it was unjust to\nexercise, and would be wicked to maintain. I must likewise atone for\nthe injuries you have sustained, and make some suitable acknowledgment\nfor that life which I have twice to-day owed to your valour and\ngenerosity. Whatever interest I have at court shall be employed in your\nbehalf; and I have other designs in your favour, which shall be\ndisclosed in due season. Meanwhile, I desire you will still add one\nobligation to the debt which I have already incurred, and carry this\nbillet in person to my Estifania, who, from the news of this fatal\noverthrow must be in despair upon my account.”So saying, he presented a letter, directed to his lady, which I\nreceived in a transport of joy, with expressions suitable to the\noccasion, and immediately set out for his country house, which happened\nto be about thirty leagues from the spot. This expedition was equally\nglorious and interesting; for my thoughts upon the road were engrossed\nby the hope of seeing Don Orgullo’s daughter and heiress Antonia, who\nwas reported to be a young lady of great beauty, and the most amiable\naccomplishments. However ridiculous it may seem for a man to conceive a\npassion for an object which he hath never beheld, certain it is, my\nsentiments were so much prepossessed by the fame of her qualifications,\nthat I must have fallen a victim to her charms, had they been much less\npowerful than they were. Notwithstanding the fatigues I had undergone\nin the field, I closed not an eye until I arrived at the gate of\nGonzales, being determined to precede the report of the battle, that\nMadame d’Orgullo might not be alarmed for the life of her husband."

I was not unacquainted with your character\nbefore this last triumph of your virtue, and have often prayed to\nHeaven for some lucky determination of that fatal quarrel which raged\nso long between the family of Gonzales and your father’s house. My\nprayers have been heard, the long-wished-for reconciliation is now\neffected, and I hope nothing will ever intervene to disturb this happy\nunion.”To this polite and affectionate declaration, I made such a reply as\nbecame a young man, whose heart overflowed with joy and benevolence,\nand desired to know how soon her answer to my commander would be ready,\nthat I might gratify his impatience with all possible despatch. After\nhaving thanked me for this fresh proof of my attachment, she begged I\nwould retire into a chamber, and repose myself from the uncommon\nfatigues I must have undergone; but, finding I persisted in the\nresolution of returning to Don Gonzales, without allowing myself the\nleast benefit of sleep, she left me engaged in conversation with an\nuncle of Don Gonzales, who lodged in the house, and gave orders that a\ncollation should be prepared in another apartment, while she retired to\nher closet, and wrote a letter to her husband.In less than an hour from my first arrival, I was introduced into a\nmost elegant dining-room, where a magnificent entertainment was served\nup, and where we were joined by Donna Estifania, and her beautiful\ndaughter the fair Antonia, who, advancing with the most amiable\nsweetness, thanked me in very warm expressions of acknowledgment, for\nthe generosity of my conduct towards her father. I had been ravished\nwith her first appearance, which far exceeded my imagination, and my\nfaculties were so disordered by this address, that I answered her\ncompliment with the most awkward confusion. But this disorder did not\nturn to my prejudice in the opinion of that lovely creature, who has\noften told me in the sequel, that she gave herself credit for that\nperplexity in my behaviour, and that I never appeared more worthy of\nher regard and affection than at that juncture, when my dress was\ndiscomposed, and my whole person disfigured by the toils and duty of\nthe preceding day; for this very dishabille presented itself to her\nreflection as the immediate effect of that very merit by which I was\nentitled to her esteem."

Forgive these\ntears; they are not the drops of weakness, but remorse. Not to trouble\nyou with idle particulars, suffice it is to say, I was favoured with\nsuch marks of distinction by Madame d’Orgullo, that she thought it\nincumbent upon her to let me know she had not overacted her\nhospitality, and, while we sat at table, accosted me in these words:\n“You will not be surprised, Don Diego, at my expressions of regard,\nwhich I own are unusual from a Spanish lady to a young cavalier like\nyou, when I communicate the contents of this letter from Don Gonzales.”\nSo saying, she put the billet into my hand, and I read these words, or\nwords to this effect:—“AMIABLE ESTIFANIA,—You will understand that I am as well as a person\ncan possibly be who hath this day lived to see the army of his king\ndefeated. If you would know the particulars of this unfortunate action,\nyour curiosity will be gratified by the bearer, Don Diego de Zelos, to\nwhose virtue and bravery I am twice indebted for my life. I therefore\ndesire you will receive him with that respect and gratitude which you\nshall think due for such an obligation; and, in entertaining him,\ndismiss that reserve which often disgraces the Spanish hospitality. In\na word, let your own virtue and beneficence conduct you upon this\noccasion, and let my Antonia’s endeavours be joined with your own in\ndoing honour to the preserver of her father! Adieu.”Such a testimonial could not fail of being very agreeable to a young\nsoldier, who by this time had begun to indulge the transporting hope of\nbeing happy in the arms of the adorable Antonia. I professed myself\nextremely happy in having met with an opportunity of acquiring such a\ndegree of my colonel’s esteem, entertained them with a detail of his\npersonal prowess in the battle, and answered all their questions with\nthat moderation which every man ought to preserve in speaking of his\nown behaviour. Our repast being ended, I took my leave of the ladies,\nand at parting received a letter from Donna Estifania to her husband,\ntogether with a ring of great value, which she begged I would accept,\nas a token of her esteem. Thus loaded with honour and caresses, I set\nout on my return for the quarters of Don Gonzales, who could scarce\ncredit his own eyes when I delivered his lady’s billet; for he thought\nit impossible to perform such a journey in so short a time."

I hope Estifania has not been deficient in her duty?” I\nanswered this question, by assuring him my entertainment had been so\nagreeable in all respects, that nothing but my duty to him could have\ninduced me to give it up so soon. He then turned the conversation upon\nAntonia, and hinted his intention of giving her in marriage to a young\ncavalier, for whom he had a particular friendship. I was so much\naffected by this insinuation, which seemed at once to blast all my\nhopes of love and happiness, that the blood forsook my face; I was\nseized with an universal trepidation, and even obliged to retire, on\npretence of being suddenly taken ill.Though Gonzales seemed to impute this disorder to fatigue and want of\nrest, he in his heart ascribed it to the true cause; and, after having\nsounded my sentiments to his own satisfaction, blessed me with a\ndeclaration, importing, that I was the person upon whom he had pitched\nfor a son-in-law. I will not trouble you with a repetition of what\npassed on this interesting occasion, but proceed to observe, that his\nintention in my favour was far from being disagreeable to his lady; and\nthat, in a little time, I had the good fortune to espouse the charming\nAntonia, who submitted to the will of her father without reluctance.Soon after this happy event, I was, by the influence of Don Gonzales,\njoined to my own interest, promoted to the command of a regiment, and\nserved with honour during the remaining part of the war. After the\ntreaty of Utrecht, I was employed in reducing the Catalans to their\nallegiance; and, in an action with those obstinate rebels had the\nmisfortune to lose my father-in-law, who by that time was preferred to\nthe rank of a major-general. The virtuous Estifania did not long\nsurvive this melancholy accident; and the loss of these indulgent\nparents made such a deep impression upon the tender heart of my\nAntonia, that I took the first opportunity of removing her from a place\nin which every object served to cherish her grief, to a pleasant villa\nnear the city of Seville, which I purchased on account of its agreeable\nsituation. That I might the more perfectly enjoy the possession of my\namiable partner, who could no longer brook the thoughts of another\nseparation, peace was no sooner re-established than I obtained leave to\nresign my commission, and I wholly devoted myself to the joys of a\ndomestic life."

Why did\nnature debase such a masterpiece with the mixture of an alloy, which\nhath involved herself and her whole family in perdition? But the ways\nof Providence are unsearchable. She hath paid the debt of her\ndegeneracy; peace be with her soul!

It is impossible to convey any adequate\nidea of a parent’s raptures in the contemplation of such a fair\nblossom. She was the only pledge of our love, she was presumptive\nheiress to a large fortune, and likely to be the sole representative of\ntwo noble Castilian families. She was the delight of all who saw her,\nand a theme of praise for every tongue. You are not to suppose that the\neducation of such a child was neglected. Indeed, it wholly engrossed\nthe attention of me and my Antonia, and her proficiency rewarded our\ncare. Before she had attained the age of fifteen, she was mistress of\nevery elegant qualification, natural and acquired. Her person was, by\nthat time, the confessed pattern of beauty. Her voice was enchantingly\nsweet, and she touched the lute with the most ravishing dexterity.\nHeaven and earth! how did my breast dilate with joy at the thoughts of\nhaving given birth to such perfection! how did my heart gush with\npaternal fondness, whenever I beheld this ornament of my name! and what\nscenes of endearing transport have I enjoyed with my Antonia, in mutual\ncongratulation upon our parental happiness!"

His birth was noble, and his\ncharacter dignified with repeated acts of generosity and virtue. Yet,\nbefore I would signify to him my approbation of his suit, I resolved to\ninform myself whether or not the heart of Serafina was totally\nunengaged, and indifferent to any other object, that I might not lay a\ntyrannical restraint upon her inclinations. The result of my inquiry\nwas a full conviction of her having hitherto been deaf to the voice of\nlove; and this piece of information, together with my own sentiments in\nhis favour, I communicated to Don Manuel, who heard these tidings with\ntransports of gratitude and joy. He was immediately favoured with\nopportunities of acquiring the affection of my daughter, and his\nendeavours were at first received with such respectful civility, as\nmight have been easily warmed into a mutual passion, had not the evil\ngenius of our family interposed.O my friend! how shall I describe the depravity of that unhappy\nvirgin’s sentiments! how recount the particulars of my own dishonour!

The house of Don Diego de Zelos was a little academy for\npainting, poetry, and music; and Heaven decreed that it should fall a\nsacrifice to its regard for these fatal and delusive arts. Among other\npreceptors, it was her fate to be under the instruction of a cursed\nGerman, who, though his profession was drawing, understood the elements\nand theory of music, possessed a large fund of learning and taste, and\nwas a person remarkable for his agreeable conversation. This traitor,\nwho like you had lost one eye, I not only admitted into my house for\nthe improvement of my daughter, but even distinguished with particular\nmarks of confidence and favour, little thinking he had either\ninclination or capacity to debauch the sentiments of my child. I was\nrejoiced beyond measure to see with what alacrity she received his\nlessons, with what avidity she listened to his discourse, which was\nalways equally moral, instructing, and entertaining.Antonia seemed to vie with me in expressions of regard for this\naccomplished stranger, whom she could not help supposing to be a person\nof rank and family, reduced to his present situation by some\nunfortunate vicissitude of fate. I was disposed to concur with this\nopinion, and actually conjured him to make me his confidant, with such\nprotestations as left him no room to doubt my honour and beneficence;\nbut he still persisted in declaring himself the son of an obscure\nmechanic in Bohemia; an origin to which surely no man would pretend who\nhad the least claim to nobility of birth. While I was thus undeceived\nin my conjecture touching his birth and quality, I was confirmed in an\nopinion of his integrity and moderation, and looked upon him as a man\nof honour, in despite of the lowness of his pedigree. Nevertheless, he\nwas at bottom a most perfidious wretch, and all this modesty and\nself-denial were the effects of the most villanous dissimulation, a\ncloak under which he, unsuspected, robbed me of my honour and my peace.Not to trouble you with particulars, the recital of which would tear my\nheart-strings with indignation and remorse, I shall only observe, that,\nby the power of his infernal insinuation, he fascinated the heart of\nSerafina, brought over Antonia herself to the interests of his passion,\nand at once detached them both from their duty and religion. Heaven and\nearth! how dangerous, how irresistible is the power of infatuation!\nWhile I remained in the midst of this blind security, waiting for the\nnuptials of my daughter, and indulging myself with the vain prospect of\nher approaching felicity, Antonia found means to protract the\nnegotiations of the marriage, by representing that it would be a pity\nto deprive Serafina of the opportunity she then had of profiting by the\nGerman’s instructions; and, upon that account, I prevailed upon Don\nManuel to bridle the impatience of his love."

Dismiss that German from your house without delay, if\nyou respect the glory of your name, and the rights of our holy\nreligion; the stranger is an abominable heretic; and, grant Heaven! he\nmay not have already poisoned the minds of those you hold most dear.” I\nhad been extremely alarmed at the beginning of this address; but,\nfinding the imputation limited to the article of religion, in which,\nthank God, I am no bigot, I recovered my serenity of disposition,\nthanked the old woman for her zeal, commended her piety, and encouraged\nher to persevere in making observations on such subjects as should\nconcern my honour and my quiet.We live in such a world of wickedness and fraud, that a man cannot be\ntoo vigilant in his own defence: had I employed such spies from the\nbeginning, I should in all probability have been at this day in\npossession of every comfort that renders life agreeable. The duenna,\nthus authorised, employed her sagacity with such success, that I had\nreason to suspect the German of a design upon the heart of Serafina;\nbut, as the presumptions did not amount to conviction, I contented\nmyself with exiling him from my house, under the pretext of having\ndiscovered that he was an enemy to the Catholic church; and forthwith\nappointed a day for the celebration of my daughter’s marriage with Don\nManuel de Mendoza. I could easily perceive a cloud of melancholy\noverspread the faces of Serafina and her mother, when I declared these\nmy resolutions; but, as they made no objection to what I proposed, I\ndid not at that time enter into an explanation of the true motives that\ninfluenced my conduct. Both parties were probably afraid of such\nexpostulation.Meanwhile, preparations were made for the espousals of Serafina; and,\nnotwithstanding the anxiety I had undergone, on account of her\nconnexion with the German, I began to think that her duty, her glory,\nhad triumphed over all such low-born considerations, if ever they had\nbeen entertained; because she, and even Antonia, seemed to expect the\nceremony with resignation, though the features of both still retained\nevident marks of concern, which I willingly imputed to the mutual\nprospect of their separation. This, however, was but a faithless calm,\nthat soon, ah! too soon, brought forth a tempest which hath wrecked my\nhopes."

  "content": "Two days before the appointed union of Don Manuel and Serafina, I was\ninformed by the duenna, that, while she accompanied Antonia’s\nwaiting-maid at church, she had seen her receive a billet from an old\nwoman, who, kneeling at her side, had conveyed it in such a mysterious\nmanner, as awakened the duenna’s apprehensions about her young lady;\nshe had therefore hastened home to communicate this piece of\nintelligence, that I might have an opportunity of examining the\nmessenger before she could have time to deposit her trust. I could not\nhelp shivering with fearful presages upon this occasion, and even\nabhorring the person to whose duty and zeal I was beholden for the\nintelligence, even while I endeavoured to persuade myself that the\ninquiry would end in the detection of some paltry intrigue between the\nmaid and her own gallant. I intercepted her in returning from church,\nand, commanding her to follow me to a convenient place, extorted from\nher, by dint of threats, the fatal letter, which I read to this\neffect:—“The whole business of my life, O divine Serafina! will be to repay\nthat affection I have been so happy as to engage. With what transport\nthen shall I obey your summons, in performing that enterprise, which\nwill rescue you from the bed of a detested rival, and put myself in\nfull possession of a jewel which I value infinitely more than life!\nYes, adorable creature! I have provided everything for our escape, and\nat midnight will attend you in your own apartment, from whence you\nshall be conveyed into a land of liberty and peace, where you will,\nunmolested, enjoy the purity of that religion you have espoused, and in\nfull security bless the arms of your ever faithful, ORLANDO.”Were you a fond parent, a tender husband, and a noble Castilian, I\nshould not need to mention the unutterable horrors that took possession\nof my bosom, when I perused this accursed letter, by which I learned\nthe apostasy, disobedience, and degeneracy of my idolised Serafina, who\nhad overthrown and destroyed the whole plan of felicity which I had\nerected, and blasted all the glories of my name; and when the wretched\nmessenger, terrified by my menaces and agitation, confessed that\nAntonia herself was privy to the guilt of her daughter, whom she had\nsolemnly betrothed to that vile German, in the sight of Heaven, and\nthat by her connivance this plebeian intended, that very night, to\nbereave me of my child, I was for some moments stupefied with grief and\namazement, that gave way to an ecstasy of rage, which had well-nigh\nterminated in despair and distraction."

Behold how the drops trickle down my forehead; this\nagony is a fierce and familiar visitant; I shall banish it anon. I\nsummoned my pride, my resentment, to my assistance; these are the\ncordials that support me against all other reflections; those were the\nauxiliaries that enabled me, in the day of trial, to perform that\nsacrifice which my honour demanded, in a strain so loud as to drown the\ncries of nature, love, and compassion. Yes, they espoused that glory\nwhich humanity would have betrayed, and my revenge was noble, though\nunnatural.My scheme was soon laid, my resolution soon taken; I privately confined\nthe wretch who had been the industrious slave of this infamous\nconspiracy, that she might take no step to frustrate or interrupt the\nexecution of my design. Then repairing to the house of an apothecary\nwho was devoted to my service, communicated my intention, which he\ndurst not condemn, and could not reveal, without breaking the oath of\nsecrecy I had imposed; and he furnished me with two vials of poison for\nthe dismal catastrophe I had planned. Thus provided, I, on pretence of\nsudden business at Seville, carefully avoided the dear, the wretched\npair, whom I had devoted to death, that my heart might not relent, by\nmeans of those tender ideas which the sight of them would have\ninfallibly inspired; and, when daylight vanished, took my station near\nthat part of the house through which the villain must have entered on\nhis hellish purpose. There I stood, in a state of horrid expectation,\nmy soul ravaged with the different passions that assailed it, until the\nfatal moment arrived; when I perceived the traitor approach the window\nof a lower apartment, which led into that of Serafina, and gently\nlifting the casement, which was purposely left unsecured, insinuated\nhalf of his body into the house. Then rushing upon him, in a transport\nof fury, I plunged my sword into his heart, crying, “Villain! receive\nthe reward of thy treachery and presumption.”"

  "content": "The steel was so well aimed as to render a repetition of the stroke\nunnecessary; he uttered one groan, and fell breathless at my feet.\nExulting with this first success of my revenge, I penetrated into the\nchamber where the robber of my peace was expected by the unhappy\nSerafina and her mother, who, seeing me enter with a most savage\naspect, and a sword reeking with the vengeance I had taken, seemed\nalmost petrified with fear. “Behold,” said I, “the blood of that base\nplebeian, who made an attempt upon the honour of my house; your\nconspiracy against the unfortunate Don Diego de Zelos is now\ndiscovered; that presumptuous slave, the favoured Orlando, is now no\nmore.”Scarce had I pronounced these words, when a loud scream was uttered by\nboth the unhappy victims. “If Orlando is slain,” cried the infatuated\nSerafina, “what have I to do with life? O my dear lord! my husband, and\nmy lover! how are our promised joys at once cut off! here, strike, my\nfather! complete your barbarous sacrifice! the spirit of the murdered\nOrlando still hovers for his wife.” These frantic exclamations, in\nwhich she was joined by Antonia, kept up the fury of my resentment,\nwhich by meekness and submission might have been weakened and rendered\nineffectual. “Yes, hapless wretches,” I replied, “ye shall enjoy your\nwish: the honour of my name requires that both shall die; yet I will\nnot mangle the breast of Antonia, on which I have so often reposed; I\nwill not shed the blood of Zelos, nor disfigure the beauteous form of\nSerafina, on which I have so often gazed with wonder and unspeakable\ndelight. Here is an elixir, to which I trust the consummation of my\nrevenge.”So saying, I emptied the vials into separate cups, and, presenting one\nin each hand, the miserable, the fair offenders instantly received the\ndestined draughts, which they drank without hesitation; then praying to\nheaven for the wretched Don Diego, sunk upon the same couch, and\nexpired without a groan. O well-contrived beverage! O happy\ncomposition, by which all the miseries of life are so easily cured!"

  "content": "Such was the fate of Antonia and Serafina; these hands were the\ninstruments that deprived them of life, these eyes beheld them the\nrichest prize that death had ever won. Powers supreme! does Don Diego\nlive to make this recapitulation? I have done my duty; but ah! I am\nhaunted by the furies of remorse; I am tortured with the incessant\nstings of remembrance and regret; even now the images of my wife and\ndaughter present themselves to my imagination. All the scenes of\nhappiness I have enjoyed as a lover, husband, and parent, all the\nendearing hopes I have cherished, now pass in review before me,\nembittering the circumstances of my inexpressible woe; and I consider\nmyself as a solitary outcast from all the comforts of society. But,\nenough of these unmanly complaints; the yearnings of nature are too\nimportunate.Having completed my vengeance, I retired into my closet, and,\nfurnishing myself with some ready money and jewels of considerable\nvalue, went into the stable, saddled my favourite steed, which I\ninstantly mounted, and, before the tumults of my breast subsided, found\nmyself at the town of St. Lucar. There I learned from inquiry, that\nthere was a Dutch bark in the harbour ready to sail; upon which I\naddressed myself to the master, who, for a suitable gratification, was\nprevailed upon to weigh anchor that same night; so that, embarking\nwithout delay, I soon bid eternal adieu to my native country. It was\nnot from reason and reflection that I took these measures for my\npersonal safety; but, in consequence of an involuntary instinct, that\nseems to operate in the animal machine, while the faculty of thinking\nis suspended.To what a dreadful reckoning was I called, when reason resumed her\nfunction! You may believe me, my friend, when I assure you, that I\nshould not have outlived those tragedies I acted, had I not been\nrestrained from doing violence upon myself by certain considerations,\nwhich no man of honour ought to set aside. I could not bear the thought\nof falling ingloriously by the hand of an executioner, and entailing\ndisgrace upon a family that knew no stain; and I was deterred from\nputting an end to my own misery, by the apprehension of posthumous\ncensure, which would have represented me as a desponding wretch,\nutterly destitute of that patience, fortitude, and resignation, which\nare the characteristics of a true Castilian. I was also influenced by\nreligious motives that suggested to me the necessity of living to\natone, by my sufferings and sorrow, for the guilt I had incurred in\ncomplying with a savage punctilio, which is, I fear, displeasing in the\nsight of Heaven."

In consequence of unfavourable winds, our\nvessel for some days made small progress in her voyage to Holland, and\nnear the coast of Gallicia we were joined by an English ship from Vigo,\nthe master of which gave us to understand, that before he set sail, a\ncourier had arrived from Madrid at that place, with orders for the\ncorregidore to prevent the escape of any native Spaniard by sea from\nany port within his district; and to use his utmost endeavours to\napprehend the person of Don Diego de Zelos, who was suspected of\ntreasonable practices against the state. Such an order, with a minute\ndescription of my person, was at the same time despatched to all the\nseaports and frontier places in Spain.You may easily suppose how I, who was already overwhelmed with\ndistress, could bear this aggravation of misfortune and disgrace: I,\nwho had always maintained the reputation of loyalty, which was acquired\nat the hazard of my life, and the expense of my blood. To deal\ncandidly, I must own, that this intelligence roused me from a lethargy\nof grief which had begun to overpower my faculties. I immediately\nimputed this dishonourable charge to the evil offices of some villain,\nwho had basely taken the advantage of my deplorable situation, and I\nwas inflamed, inspirited with the desire of vindicating my fame, and\nrevenging the injury. Thus animated, I resolved to disguise myself\neffectually from the observation of those spies which every nation\nfinds its account in employing in foreign countries; I purchased this\nhabit from the Dutch navigator, in whose house I kept myself concealed,\nafter our arrival at Amsterdam, until my beard was grown to a\nsufficient length to favour my design, and then appeared as a Persian\ndealer in jewels. As I could gain no satisfactory information touching\nmyself in this country, had no purpose to pursue, and was extremely\nmiserable among a people, who, being mercenary and unsocial, were very\nill adapted to alleviate the horrors of my condition, I gratified my\nlandlord for his important services, with the best part of my effects;\nand having, by his means, procured a certificate from the magistracy,\nrepaired to Rotterdam, from whence I set out in a travelling carriage\nfor Antwerp, on my way to this capital; hoping, with a succession of\ndifferent objects, to mitigate the anguish of my mind, and by the most\nindustrious inquiry, to learn such particulars of that false\nimpeachment, as would enable me to take measures for my own\njustification, as well as for projecting a plan of revenge against the\nvile perfidious author."

The officers of police in this city are so inquisitive and\nvigilant that the most minute action of a stranger is scrutinised with\ngreat severity; and, although the inhabitants are very frank in\ndiscoursing on indifferent subjects, they are at the same time\nextremely cautious in avoiding all conversation that turns upon state\noccurrences and maxims of government. In a word, the peculiarity of my\nappearance subjects me so much to particular observation, that I have\nhitherto thought proper to devour my griefs in silence, and even to\nbear the want of almost every convenience, rather than hazard a\npremature discovery, by offering my jewels to sale.In this emergency I have been so far fortunate as to become acquainted\nwith you, whom I look upon as a man of honour and humanity. Indeed, I\nwas at first sight prepossessed in your favour, for, notwithstanding\nthe mistakes which men daily commit in judging from appearances, there\nis something in the physiognomy of a stranger from which one cannot\nhelp forming an opinion of his character and disposition. For once, my\npenetration hath not failed me; your behaviour justifies my decision;\nyou have treated me with that sympathy and respect which none but the\ngenerous will pay to the unfortunate. I have trusted you accordingly. I\nhave put my life, my honour, in your power; and I must beg leave to\ndepend upon your friendship, for obtaining that satisfaction for which\nalone I seek to live. Your employment engages you in the gay world; you\ndaily mingle with the societies of men; the domestics of the Spanish\nambassador will not shun your acquaintance; you may frequent the\ncoffee-houses to which they resort; and, in the course of these\noccasions, unsuspected inform yourself of that mysterious charge which\nlies heavy on the fame of the unfortunate Don Diego. I must likewise\nimplore your assistance in converting my jewels into money, that I may\nbreathe independent of man, until Heaven shall permit me to finish this\nweary pilgrimage of life.CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENA FLAGRANT INSTANCE OF FATHOM’S VIRTUE, IN THE MANNER OF HIS RETREAT TO\nENGLAND."

  "content": "Fathom, who had lent an attentive ear to every circumstance of this\ndisastrous story, no sooner heard it concluded, than, with an aspect of\ngenerous and cordial compassion, not even unattended with tears, he\ncondoled the lamentable fate of Don Diego de Zelos, deplored the\nuntimely death of the gentle Antonia and the fair Serafina, and\nundertook the interest of the wretched Castilian with such warmth of\nsympathising zeal, as drew a flood from his eyes, while he wrung his\nbenefactor’s hand in a transport of gratitude. Those were literally\ntears of joy, or at least of satisfaction, on both sides; as our hero\nwept with affection and attachment to the jewels that were to be\ncommitted to his care; but, far from discovering the true source of his\ntenderness, he affected to dissuade the Spaniard from parting with the\ndiamonds, which he counselled him to reserve for a more pressing\noccasion; and, in the meantime, earnestly entreated him to depend upon\nhis friendship for present relief.This generous proffer served only to confirm Don Diego’s resolution,\nwhich he forthwith executed, by putting into the hands of Ferdinand\njewels to the value of a thousand crowns, and desiring him to detain\nfor his own use any part of the sum they would raise. Our adventurer\nthanked him for the good opinion he entertained of his integrity, an\nopinion fully manifested in honouring him with such important\nconfidence, and assured him he would transact his affairs with the\nutmost diligence, caution, and despatch. The evening being by this time\nalmost consumed, these new allies retired separately to rest; though\neach passed the night without repose, in very different reflections,\nthe Castilian being, as usual, agitated with the unceasing pangs of his\nunalterable misery, interspersed with gleaming hopes of revenge; and\nFathom being kept awake with revolving plans for turning his\nfellow-lodger’s credulity to his own advantage. From the nature of the\nSpaniard’s situation, he might have appropriated the jewels to himself,\nand remained in Paris without fear of a prosecution, because the\ninjured party had, by the above narrative, left his life and liberty at\ndiscretion.—But he did not think himself secure from the personal\nresentment of an enraged desperate Castilian; and therefore determined\nto withdraw himself privately into that country where he had all along\nproposed to fix the standard of his finesse, which fortune had now\nempowered him to exercise according to his wish."
