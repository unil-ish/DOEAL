  "content": "“Tenderly flirting”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\nsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could\nhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\nsame. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\nmelancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there\nhimself.But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\ncontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving\nhome.Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\nwell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\nan affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\nand her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,\nwith others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\ndisposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former."

Her answer was warmly in his favour.\nWith an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you\nsay that he was at Rosings?”“Nearly three weeks.”“And you saw him frequently?”“Yes, almost every day.”“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray\nmay I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in\naddress that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his\nordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more\nserious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much\nwhat he ever was.”While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\nrejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\nand anxious attention, while she added,--“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\neither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,\nfrom knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\naccents,--"

His pride, in that direction,\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\nhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that\nthe sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\njudgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I\nknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\nwish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he\nhas very much at heart.”Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\nslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\nmutual desire of never meeting again.When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\nand impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there\nwas every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous\nhappiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus\nof her sisters were uttered without being heard.[Illustration:The arrival of the\nGardiners\n]CHAPTER XLII.[Illustration]"

  "content": "Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\nnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\ncomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\nof good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\nwoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of\ndomestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\nimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\nfather’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife."

  "content": "When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\nabroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\nsister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around\nthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\nfolly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a\nwatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\nhas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked\nforward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation\nfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\nand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\nscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\nWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\nBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\nsister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\npleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\nnever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\nthe defence of some little peculiar vexation.”When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\nalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\ncamp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less\nto be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\ntoo full of lines under the words to be made public.After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\ngood-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything\nwore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter\ncame back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.\nBennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle\nof June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton\nwithout tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth\nhope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably\nreasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by\nsome cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment\nshould be quartered in Meryton."

  "content": "The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\napproaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\nwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\npresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\nher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\nDovedale, or the Peak.Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing\nthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\nand all was soon right again.With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\nowner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,\nand rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\nbefore her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\nMrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\nLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\nmorning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\nenjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\nsuitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\ninconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\nand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\ndisappointments abroad."

A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\nconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s\nformer residence, and where she had lately learned that some\nacquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\nall the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\nLambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\nwas not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\ninclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\nmuch?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your\nacquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\nknow.”Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\nmust own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,\nshe really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\nrichly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\ngrounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\ncountry.”Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\noccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such\na risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\nthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the\nabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\nproprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\nthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her\nalarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\nto the scheme.To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.[Illustration:“Conjecturing as to the date”\n]CHAPTER XLIII.[Illustration]"

  "content": "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\nentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\na beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\nevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\nhalf a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\neminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\nPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\nthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\nwoody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\nswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\nwere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\nwonder at her being where she was."

  "content": "The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\nwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\ndistance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\nit, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\ntaking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\nto be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\nsuitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\nadmiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\nfine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\nfurniture of Rosings.“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With\nthese rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting\nherself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\nme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\nabsent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\nasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\nreplied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\nparty of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\nnot by any circumstance been delayed a day!Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\nthe likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\nminiatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\nshe liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\npicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\nhad been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the\narmy,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\nreturn it.“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\nother--about eight years ago.”“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\nlooking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\nus whether it is like or not.”Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\nintimation of her knowing her master.“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”"

  "content": "“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”“Yes, very handsome.”“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\nmaster’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\nbe then. He was very fond of them.”This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\nwhen she was only eight years old.“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\naccomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\nnew instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\ncomes here to-morrow with him.”Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\ncommunicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\nfrom pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\nmaster and his sister.“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\ngood enough for him.”Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\nhim,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\never since he was four years old.”"

That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\nHer keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\ngrateful to her uncle for saying,--“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\nhaving such a master.”“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\nmeet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\nwas always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\nworld.”Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\nas affable to the poor.”Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\nfurniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\nprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\nmany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\nlived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\nthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\ngive him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\nsaw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\naway like other young men.”“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”“Perhaps we might be deceived.”“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”"

There\nis nothing he would not do for her.”The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\nDarcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\nalso more intelligible.In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\nof the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\nwhen he looked at her.

The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\nconsidered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How\nmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\nor evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\nthe housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\nthe canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\nherself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\nthan it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\nits impropriety of expression.When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\nthey returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\nsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\nof perfect civility."

Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\nreturned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\nuttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\nminutes in which they continued together were some of the most\nuncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\ninquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\ndistraction of his thoughts.At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\nleave.The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\nfeelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\nvexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\nthing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\ndisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\nshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\nor, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\ndiscrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\nagain over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\nstrikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\nfamily! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\nnever had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\nWhat a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\nhe put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\naccount for it."

Her thoughts were all fixed on that\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\nwas. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\nher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\ncomposure.At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself."

  "content": "They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\nascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\nof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\nthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\noverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\nexpressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\nmiles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\ncircuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\nhanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\nThey crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\nthe scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\nthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\nit. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\nthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\nabout them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\nmet. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\ninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\nhe had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\nshe began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\ngot beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\nrecollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\nher might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\nno more."

He takes them now for people of\nfashion.”The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\nit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\ncould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\nconnection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\nrelations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\nhis taste, or his good manners."

  "content": "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\nwalking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\nwonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\ncompliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\nextreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\nwhat can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\nthat his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\nwork such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\nme.”After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\nMrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\nElizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\nher husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\ntogether. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\nknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\nvery unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\nthe country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\nwill join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\nwho will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\nbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\nnot very differently engaged.“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\npause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\nme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\nduring your stay at Lambton?”"

  "content": "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\nmust be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\nhim think really ill of her.They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\nreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\nmile behind.He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\nthere seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\nshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\ngreat perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\nand her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\nthe house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\nparted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\nwalking slowly towards the house.The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\naunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\nsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\n_I_ have seen nothing of it.”“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”"

  "content": "“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\nor rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\nperfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\ndisagreeable?”Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\nhim better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\nher uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\nat his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\nwarn me off his grounds.”Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\nnothing.“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\nanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\nspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\nnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\ngood lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\nmaster, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\nevery virtue.”Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\nguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\nrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\nWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on."

Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\nintercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.[Illustration]CHAPTER XLIV.[Illustration]Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\narrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\ncurricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the\nlivery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\nto her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\na quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\nElizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\nat her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she\ndreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\nher favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her."

With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\nher beyond a monosyllable.Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\nwas sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\nElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\ninquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and\nlooked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done."
