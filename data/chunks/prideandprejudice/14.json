But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\nintrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\nchild I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\ntemper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\nand conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),\nI was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\nalmost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\nmy own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might\nstill have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\nowe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\nadvantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\ndoubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\nwishing, expecting my addresses.”“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to\ntake a proper direction.”“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?”“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\nintroduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half\nan hour after I had seen you.”He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her\ndisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\nhad arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\ncomprehend.She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\neach to be dwelt on farther.After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\nanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\nit was time to be at home."

  "content": "“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which\nintroduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\nit.“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And\nthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\nthe case.“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told\nhim of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\naffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\nthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\nfriend.“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him\nthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits\nwhich I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\nhim.”“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\nhis reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one\nthing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\nin any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\nnow.”"

  "content": "Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\nherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and\nit was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of\nBingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\ncontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\nparted.[Illustration:“Unable to utter a syllable”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER LIX.[Illustration]“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question\nwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and\nfrom all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in\nreply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own\nknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\nelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\nthe family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\n_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\nfrom Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\nyou shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;\nand I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I\nam in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we\nare engaged.”Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\nyou dislike him.”“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\ndid not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these\na good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\nremember it myself.”"

Yet now I must believe you,” cried\nJane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you\ncertain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\nhappy with him?”“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we\nare to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?\nShall you like to have such a brother?”“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\nto do?”“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I\ntell you all.”“What do you mean?”“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\nafraid you will be angry.”“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.\nLet me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me\nhow long you have loved him?”“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;\nbut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\nat Pemberley.”Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\nattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\nfurther to wish.“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I\nalways had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\nof it to another, not to you.”"

She had been unwilling to\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\nher equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer\nconceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,\nand half the night spent in conversation.“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\nmorning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\nour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\ncoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\nother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s\nway.”Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\nwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\nepithet.As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\nand he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk\nto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\nnever seen the view.”“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am\nsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\ncuriosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\nconsented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\nsaying,--“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\ndisagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\nall for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\nhim except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”"

  "content": "During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be\nasked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\napplication for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\nher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\ndisapprobation.In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\nMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\nextreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\npretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he\nwants you in the library.” She was gone directly.Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\nof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\nBut will they make you happy?”“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my\nindifference?”“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.”“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\nsuch terms.”"

  "content": "“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\ndisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\nabout.”Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\nand, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\nobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\nestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\nhis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\nmonths’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\nshe did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\nmatch.“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\nyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\nand economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\nMr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\nat last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\nhalf an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\nthe others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\nanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\nwould come in time."

  "content": "When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\nand made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\nfor, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\nutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could\ncomprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what\nwas for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\nlover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\nher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\nhave thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\nyou will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\ndear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\nLord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\nher mother followed her.“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten\nthousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a\nspecial licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.\nBut, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond\nof, that I may have it to-morrow.”This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\nevery hour in his esteem.“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\nas Jane’s.”"

It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\nknew that I _had_ begun.”“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\nto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be\nsincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\nattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\nand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and\ninterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\namiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\nin your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\ncourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;\nand really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\nreasonable.

What made you so shy of me, when you\nfirst called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?”“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”“But I was embarrassed.”“And so was I.”“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”“A man who had felt less might.”“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it!

Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\nor had you intended any more serious consequences?”“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\nmight ever hope to make you love me.

Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and\nthough feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much\nkinder answer than she knew was deserved.The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was\nas sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\nbeing loved by her sister.Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\nto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this\nsudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\nmeeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure.

Elizabeth did all she could to\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to\nkeep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might\nconverse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\narising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its\npleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward\nwith delight to the time when they should be removed from society so\nlittle pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their\nfamily party at Pemberley.[Illustration]CHAPTER LXI.[Illustration]Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\nrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she\nafterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be\nguessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\naccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of\nher children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\namiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,\nit was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous\nand invariably silly.Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\ndrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in\ngoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\n_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\nsisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\nto Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\nher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\nknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\ntemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she\nbecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\nignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s\nsociety she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going."

  "content": "Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite\nunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\nmuch reluctance.As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\nthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of\neverything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be\nprevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by\nhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The\nletter was to this effect:--/* “My dear Lizzy, */“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear\n     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\n     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\n     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\n     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\n     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four\n     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\n     if you had rather not.“Yours,” etc."

  "content": "As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in\nher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\nof what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\nherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards\ndischarging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a\ncheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection\nfor her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,\nin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\nreputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never\nreceive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him\nfurther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when\nher husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the\nBingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even\nBingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_\nof giving them a hint to be gone.Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she\nthought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\ndropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\nattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\nto Elizabeth.Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\nother, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\nastonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of\ntalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\nwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\npleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\nher way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a\nwoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\nall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\nand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\nthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city."
