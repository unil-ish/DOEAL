  "content": "“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\nbreakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\ncharming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they\nmay have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the\nplace to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.\nYou and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at\nNewcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I\nwill take care to get good partners for them all.”“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\nwinter is over.”“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.”Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\nhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\nshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\nhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\nthink than such as did not.Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to\nfind it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\nof having a companion."

  "content": "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did\neverything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds\non the first of September than anybody else in the country.One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\nnot by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\ncurious to hear how it was managed?”“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little\nsaid on the subject.”“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\no’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\nwere to meet us at the church.“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\nyou know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\nhave gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\ndressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\nsermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\nthinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\nhe would be married in his blue coat.“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open."

  "content": "“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was\ncalled away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so\nfrightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;\nand if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,\nluckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set\nout. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented\ngoing, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as\nwell.”“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!\nI quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\nsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will\nask you no questions.”“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\nall, and then Wickham would be so angry.”On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\npower, by running away.But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\nwas impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\nsister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\nLydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\nintended.“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to\nknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively\nspeaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\na time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\nthink necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\nignorance.”"

She was no sooner in possession of it, than\nhurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\ninterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\nhappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\ncontain a denial./* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */“My dear Niece,"

  "content": "“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\n     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\n     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\n     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\n     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\n     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_\n     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\n     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing\n     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\n     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\n     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\n     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\n     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\n     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\n     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\n     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\n     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\n     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\n     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\n     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\n     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\n     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\n     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\n     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\n     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\n     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\n     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\n     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\n     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\n     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\n     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\n     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\n     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\n     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\n     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\n     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\n     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\n     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\n     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\n     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\n     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\n     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\n     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\n     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\n     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\n     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\n     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\n     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\n     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\n     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\n     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\n     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\n     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\n     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\n     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\n     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\n     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\n     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\n     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\n     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\n     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\n     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\n     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\n     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\n     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\n     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\n     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\n     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\n     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\n     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\n     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\n     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\n     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\n     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\n     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\n     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\n     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\n     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\n     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\n     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\n     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\n     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\n     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\n     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\n     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\n     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\n     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\n     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\n     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\n     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\n     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\n     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\n     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\n     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\n     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\n     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\n     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\n     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\n     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\n     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\n     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\n     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\n     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\n     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\n     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\n     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\n     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\n     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\n     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\n     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\n     in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He\n     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\n     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\n     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\n     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\n     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\n     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever\n     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\n     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\n     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\n     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair\n     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The\n     children have been wanting me this half hour."

  "content": "The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\ngreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\nproduced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her\nsister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of\ngoodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\njust, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest\nextent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken\non himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\nresearch; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he\nmust abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently\nmeet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always\nmost wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\npronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard\nnor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it\nwas a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt\nthat even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his\naffection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with\nWickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from\nthe connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think\nhow much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\nextraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\nhe had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\nit; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\nshe could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might\nassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\nmaterially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\nthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\nreturn. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to\nhim. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she\nhad ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards\nhim! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that\nin a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better\nof himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\nagain. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible\nof some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly\nboth she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence\nsubsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself."

Are the others coming out?”“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.”She replied in the affirmative.“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”“Yes, she did.”“And what did she say?”“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\nmisrepresented.”“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\nElizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this\ntime of year.”“Undoubtedly.

I thought I\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.”“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”“And do you like her?”“Very much.”“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\nor two.

He\nsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\nthe house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\nall. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with\none’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said\nElizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\nsingle.”“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\nbut only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\nrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\narticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\nat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\nmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\nsmiled, and shook her head, by turns."

  "content": "“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\nPhilips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that\nI care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\nnever want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\nNetherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\nis nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\na word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in\nMeryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\nto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\ncomes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\ngoing to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\ncolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\nthere _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\nwithout it.“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come\nto a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this\nspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them."

  "content": "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you\nwill wait on him, of course.”“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\nNetherfield.“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let\nhim seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\nrunning after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\nagain.”“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\non him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\nhim.”Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\nhusband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\n_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\nbut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\nsays. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\nis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\nof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\nalways so much.”"

  "content": "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\nand fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\nthat must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\nseeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\nHertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\npaddock, and ride towards the house.Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\nto the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\nagain by her sister.“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\nknow.”“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\nhim before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\nMr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.”Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\nenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\nmother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\nGardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\nhim. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\nand whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\nbehaviour in Derbyshire."

  "content": "The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\nwishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\nenough for expectation.”She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\nsister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\ngentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her\nmother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher courtesy and address of his friend.Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied."

  "content": "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question\nwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He\nwas not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\nfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\nthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\nthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\nwith herself for being so.“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.He readily agreed to it.“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\nseen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,\nGeorge Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\nIt was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\nto make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\ncontinued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\nhard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\nplace quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\nknow how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\nhis leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\nThank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\ndeserves.”"

  "content": "Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\nof shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\nthe exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\nbefore; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\ncountry at present. A few weeks, he believed.“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\n“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\nBennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the coveys for you.”Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\nflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\nmoments of such painful confusion.“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\none or the other again!”Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\nhow much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former\nlover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\nfive minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her\nas handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\nunaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\nthat she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\nLongbourn in a few days’ time.“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\nus as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you\nI was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your\nengagement.”"

  "content": "Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\nhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\non whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\nof one who had ten thousand a year.[Illustration:“Jane happened to look round”\n]CHAPTER LIV.[Illustration]As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\nor, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects\nwhich must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed\nher.“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\n“did he come at all?”She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he\nwas in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he\nno longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think\nno more about him.”Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her\nbetter satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\neasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\nhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\nseen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent\nacquaintance.”“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!\ntake care.”“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\nyou as ever.”They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\ngood-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\nhad revived."

  "content": "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\nsportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\nthe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\ninvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\ndecided. He placed himself by her.Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\nbore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\nthe family.She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\nthan the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\ncame, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\nchance of pleasure for the evening must depend.“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\never.”"

And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\ndo we?”Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\nto help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\nbeing so silly!“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\nthese three weeks.”She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them."
