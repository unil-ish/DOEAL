  "content": "At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,\neverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\nappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\nthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\nat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\nliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\ncoming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\ninstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:\nhis formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\nfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\nneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were\nin the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\nformality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s\noffers of refreshment.Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\nfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,\nand its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\neverything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\nby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,\nthat she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\nCollins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\nwhich certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\nCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\nCharlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire\nevery article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the\nfender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\ngarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\nwhich he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\nwith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\nowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\nthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\ninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\nwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\nfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\nthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\nthe country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\nthe prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\nbordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a\nhandsome modern building, well situated on rising ground."

  "content": "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\nbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\nprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\nwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which\nElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\nforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\nCharlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\nforgotten.She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\nin, observed,--“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\nbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\nservice is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\ninclude you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\nwalk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added\nCharlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\ntelling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\nCharlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\npass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse\nwith Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all."

She opened\nthe door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with\nagitation, cried out,--[Illustration:“In Conversation with the ladies”[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\nthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\nhaste, and come down this moment.”Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;\nand down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest\nof this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the\ngarden gate.“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs\nwere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter!”“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady\nCatherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The\nother is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\ncreature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\nWhy does she not come in?”“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\nwhen Miss De Bourgh comes in.”“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She\nlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\nmake him a very proper wife.”Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\nwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that\nway.At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\nto dine at Rosings the next day.[Illustration:‘Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.’[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER XXIX."

I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that\nit would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\nWho could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine\nthere (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so\nimmediately after your arrival?”“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\n“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\nmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\ninstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\nvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\nthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\nso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\nElizabeth,--“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\nCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\nbecomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\nfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for\nbeing simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\npreserved.”"

  "content": "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\nher Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\nwho had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\nto his presentation at St. James’s.As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\nacross the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\nraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment\nincreasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\nElizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\nCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she\nthought she could witness without trepidation.From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\nthe servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,\nher daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\nwith her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was\nperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\nwhich he would have thought necessary."

  "content": "In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\ncomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\nconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\nvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\nsilence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as\nmarked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\nElizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she\nbelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her\nbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\nher eyes.After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\nadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\nlooking at in the summer."

He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;\nand every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who\nwas now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady\nCatherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most\ngracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty\nto them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready\nto speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\nthe dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how\nlittle Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and\nfearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\nand the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\ndone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\nsubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\nher judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as\nto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\nregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\nbeneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an\noccasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\nMrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\nthe least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\npretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\nmother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\nquestions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\nobserved,--“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your\nsake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\nBennet?”“A little.”“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it\nsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?”“One of them does.”"

Do\nyou draw?”“No, not at all.”“What, none of you?”“Not one.”“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\nshould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”“Has your governess left you?”“We never had any governess.”“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\nwithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\nhave been quite a slave to your education.”Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\nbeen the case.“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must\nhave been neglected.”“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\nwished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\nidle certainly might.”“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had\nknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\none. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\nand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\nway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\nit was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who\nwas merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s\ncalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady\nCatherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your\nyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”“Yes, ma’am, all.”“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\nyounger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must\nbe very young?”"

The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\nas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\nnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly\nfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\nLadyship can hardly expect me to own it.”Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\nconceal your age.”“I am not one-and-twenty.”When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\nwere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\nexpressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or\nhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\nwas employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her\nfor every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.\nSir William did not say much.

The party then gathered\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\narrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\nCollins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As\nsoon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\ncousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\nfor Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\nher commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\nsatisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s\npraise into his own hands.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXX.[Illustration]Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long\nenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,\nand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\noften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\nmornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but\nwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\nand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\ncousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast\nand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in\nreading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,\nwhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\nElizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\nthe dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\npleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\nreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\nmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\nalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\nalmost every day.

Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\nout that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the\ncommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\nMr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\nquarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\nthem into harmony and plenty.[Illustration:“he never failed to inform them”\n]The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\nof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\nof the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\ncomfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\nshe frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity."

Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\nby Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\nMiss Lucas and herself.His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\nin order to have[Illustration:“The gentlemen accompanied him.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage\nturned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\ntwo nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought\nwith him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;\nand, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,\nthe gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her\nhusband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the\nother, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure.

What is it you are talking\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid\na reply.“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true\nenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever\nlearnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her\nhealth had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\nperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady\nCatherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\nif she does not practise a great deal.”“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.\nShe practises very constantly.”“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\ntell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\nconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will\nnever play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\nJenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part\nof the house.”Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made\nno answer."

Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\nher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\nconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\nme. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.\nThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\nthe will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\nintimidate me.”“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could\nnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\nfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,\nare not your own.”Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\nColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\nin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\npart of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\nof credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\nand such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\nFitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The\nfirst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at\na ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four\ndances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four\ndances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more\nthan one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,\nyou cannot deny the fact.”“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\nbeyond my own party.”"

  "content": "“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an\nintroduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend\nhimself to strangers?”“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,\n“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\nconcerns, as I often see done.”“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the\nmasterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take\nthe trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers\nas capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\nto Darcy,--“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”"

  "content": "Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his\ncousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\nDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\ngentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was\nready to take them all home.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXXII.[Illustration]Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\nwhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\nvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\nLady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her\nhalf-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,\nwhen the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.\nDarcy only, entered the room.He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his\nintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\nbe within.They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\nseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\ndeparture, she observed,--“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”“Perfectly so, I thank you.”She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short\npause, added,--“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\nreturning to Netherfield again?”"

  "content": "“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\nvery little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\nat a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\nincreasing.”“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\nprinciple.”“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.”Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\nCollins first came to Hunsford.”“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\nkindness on a more grateful object.”“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\nthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\nthing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\ndistance of her own family and friends.”“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s\njourney. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\nof the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins\nwas settled _near_ her family.”“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”"

  "content": "As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\nthe present distance.”Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\nbeen always at Longbourn.”Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--“Are you pleased with Kent?”A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\nand her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_\nsurprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his\nintruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,\nwithout saying much to anybody, went away.[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was\ngone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\nhave called on us in this familiar way.”"

  "content": "But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\neven to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\nthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\nfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\nalways within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former\nfavourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there\nwas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\nFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\nlove, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\nseriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.[Illustration: “On looking up”]CHAPTER XXXIII.[Illustration]"

  "content": "More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,\nthat it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\nrencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her\npleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of\nRosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\nexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her\na little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\npales opposite the Parsonage.She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not\nwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,\nshe saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.\nPutting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally\ndo every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.\nAre you going much farther?”“No, I should have turned in a moment.”And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\ntogether.“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\narranges the business just as he pleases.”“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\ngreat pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\nmany others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\ndependence.”“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\neither. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\nwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\nweight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\nwhere they like.”“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\ndo.”"
