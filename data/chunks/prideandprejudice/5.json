A thousand things may arise in six months.”The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\ninterested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of everyone.She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\nJane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\nBingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\nthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\nLongbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\nthat, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\ncare to have two full courses.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXII.[Illustration]"

  "content": "The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\nchief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good\nhumour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\nvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\nhad any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\nBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\ncharacter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\nfrom a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\ntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\nreception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there."

The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\nestablishment were gained.Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\nexceedingly fair.

  "content": "excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and\nSir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\nshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly\nexpedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\nJames’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\noccasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\nfrom their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\nto consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\nCollins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\nirksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\nbe her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\nmarriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\nprovision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\nfrom want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\ntwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\nluck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\nsurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\nvalued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\nto give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\nquestions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\npublish his prosperous love."

You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\noffending your patroness.”“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\nmaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\naffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\nthough my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\nnow take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\nmy cousin Elizabeth.”"

  "content": "With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\nsurprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\nto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\nher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\nas that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\nshe could not help crying out,--“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\nstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\nher composure, and calmly replied,--“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\nfor it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\nwished her all imaginable happiness.“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\nvery much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\nBut when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never\nwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\nentering the marriage state.”"

  "content": "Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\nlonger; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\nwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\nnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\nmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing\nherself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\nshe had chosen.[Illustration:“Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER XXIII.[Illustration]Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,\nwhen Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\nannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\nhouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\nbut incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\npoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always\nunguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London."

  "content": "Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\ntogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\nconsole and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\nscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\nor Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\ncould at all forgive their daughter.Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\nmore foolish than his daughter!Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\nLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\nto spread at Meryton.Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\nMrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\nthough Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\nenough to drive happiness away.Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\nreal confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\nBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return."

  "content": "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\ntwelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After\ndischarging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,\nwith many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the\naffection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained\nthat it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\nLongbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;\nfor Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that\nshe wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would\nbe an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early\nday for making him the happiest of men.Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\nabsence.Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\nfalsehood.Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she\nwas to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\nfrequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\nDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\nthe strength of his attachment.As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\npainful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of\nconcealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\nwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\ndid not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all\nJane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\ntranquillity."

He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\nand, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.[Illustration:“_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”\n]Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\nMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\nand her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced\nto make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”“What should not you mind?”“I should not mind anything at all.”“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.”“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own\ndaughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXIV.[Illustration]"

The very first\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\nthe country.Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\ninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\nfor her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s\nassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\nthe caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\nwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\ncould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had\nreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;\nwhether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had\nescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\nhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded."

But I\nwill not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\nall be as we were before.”Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\nnothing.“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no\nreason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\nacquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\nnothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little\ntime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.”“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\nyou. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\ndeserve.”Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\nthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be\nafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\nof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\nor sense.

My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\ncannot have a proper way of thinking.

What sister would think\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to\npart us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\nunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them."

Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\nshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\nthe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\nher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\ncomfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one\nday, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next\nto being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and\nthen. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction\namong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\nbe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at\nMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\nbe your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\nall expect Jane’s good fortune.”“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\nthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will\nalways make the most of it.”Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\npleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\nhad known anything of the matter.Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any\nextenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of\nHertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXV.[Illustration]"

  "content": "After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.\nCollins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\nSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\nside by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to\nhope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\nwould be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave\nof his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished\nhis fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\nanother letter of thanks.On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\nbrother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at\nLongbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\ntrade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\nthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\nwoman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two\neldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\ndone, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\nMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\nhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\ngirls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\nin it."

Oh, sister! it is very hard to think\nthat she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it\nbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\nand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\na daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\nmuch entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,\nsister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\nthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\nso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\nbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of\nlong sleeves.”Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\nthe course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her\nsister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\nconversation.When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.\n“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I\nam sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,\nsuch as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty\ngirl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily\nforgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”[Illustration:“Offended two or three young ladies”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not\ndo for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen\nthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\nlove with only a few days before.”“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\noften applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_\nMr. Bingley’s love?”“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\noffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I\nspoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be\nfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”"

It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would\nbe prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of\nservice--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\nanything.”Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\nof her sister’s ready acquiescence.“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to\nthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\nout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\nunless he really comes to see her.”“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\npart of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,\nperhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\nwould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\nnever stirs without him.”“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\ncorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”But, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\npoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\nhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\nhis affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s\nattractions.Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she\nhoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she\nmight occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\nseeing him."

  "content": "The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\nengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\ndinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\nmade part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\non these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s\nwarm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\nthem, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\nresolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\nan attachment.To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\nunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\nbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part\nof Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\nacquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\nthe death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power\nto give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been\nin the way of procuring.Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\ncharacter perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible\nsubject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with\nthe minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her\ntribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was\ndelighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the\npresent Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\nthat gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might\nagree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having\nheard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,\nill-natured boy.[Illustration:“Will you come and see me?”\n]CHAPTER XXVI.[Illustration]Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on\nthe first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after\nhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--"

Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\nyourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of\nfortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\n_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you\nmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\ncan prevent it.”“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\nof it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does\nme the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\nfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\nsince we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are\nseldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\nof my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that\nit would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is\nnot to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his\nfirst object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In\nshort, I will do my best.”“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\noften. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\nthat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\nso frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the\nnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you\nare satisfied.”"
