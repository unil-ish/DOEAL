Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”[Illustration:“She is tolerable”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\nElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,\n“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\nbook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\nhad a very different story to hear."

  "content": "“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\nher twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\n“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\nhis partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\nin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”[Illustration]CHAPTER IV.[Illustration]When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\nshe admired him.“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\nwith such perfect good breeding!”“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\nlikewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\ndid not expect such a compliment.”"

What\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\nthe room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\nstupider person.”“Dear Lizzy!”“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\nwhat I think.”“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\ngood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\nof the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\nneighbour in her.”"

  "content": "Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\nwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\nvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\nladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\npower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\nThey were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\nseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\nof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\nthemselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\nmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\nacquired by trade.Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\nsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\npurchase.His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\nage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\nhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\nunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\ndeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\nreserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\ngiving offence."

  "content": "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\ngirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\nmuch.Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\nestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER V.[Illustration]Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\nand, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\na mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\ncontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,\nfriendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him\ncourteous.Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\nElizabeth’s intimate friend.That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”"

To be\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\nabout Mr. Robinson.”“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\nanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\nCharlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\nis he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\n“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\nspoke to.”“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless\namong his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\nagreeable.”“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\nto the ball in a hack chaise.”“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I\nwish he had danced with Eliza.”“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,\nif I were you.”"

One cannot wonder that so\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\nto be proud.”“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\nreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\nourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his\nsisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\nBennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\ndirectly.”The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\nwould; and the argument ended only with the visit.[Illustration][Illustration]CHAPTER VI.[Illustration]"

  "content": "The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the\ngood-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the\ntwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\npleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\neverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\nin all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\nwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss\nLucas.“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\ndiscover it too.”“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\nit, he must find it out.”“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\nin love as much as she chooses.”"

But\nthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\nenough to make her understand his character.”“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\nevenings may do a great deal.”“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\nlife.”“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”"

  "content": "Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\nallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\nthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\nto dance with.He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were\nassembled.“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\nconversation with Colonel Forster?”“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George\nAllen._]]On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\na subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\nturned to him and said,--“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well\njust now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\nMeryton?”“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\nenergetic.”“You are severe on us.”“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a\nmusical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\nhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\nshe added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\nat Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\nof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\nI shall keep mine to swell my song.”"

  "content": "Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\nwould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\nimpatient for display.Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\nsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\ndancing at one end of the room.Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\nnothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\nrefinements of polished societies.”“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\ncontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\nyou often dance at St. James’s?”“Never, sir.”“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”“You have a house in town, I conclude?”Mr. Darcy bowed.“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”"

Mr. Darcy, you must allow\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\nfor one half hour.”“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\npartner?”Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\nher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”“I should imagine not.”“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\nevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\nyour opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the\nnoise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\npeople! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”"

A lady’s\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\nabsolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.[Illustration:“A note for Miss Bennet”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER VII.[Illustration]Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\nhad left her four thousand pounds.She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\nfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\nLondon in a respectable line of trade."

The two youngest of the family,\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\nhours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\nnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\nsome from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\nwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\nthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\nthe head-quarters.Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\nintelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\nofficers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\nand at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\nvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\nunknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\nBingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\nan ensign.After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\nBennet coolly observed,--“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\nI am now convinced.”Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\nnext morning to London.“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\nof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\nfoolish.”"

When they get to our age, I dare say they will\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\nliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\nshould want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\nhis regimentals.”“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\nnote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud./* NIND “My dear friend, */“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\n     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\n     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never\n     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of\n     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\n     Yours ever,“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\n_that_.”“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\nrain; and then you must stay all night.”“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that\nthey would not offer to send her home.”“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”“I had much rather go in the coach.”“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose\nwill be answered.”"

  "content": "She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\nwere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\nday. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\nrained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\nJane certainly could not come back.“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--/* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\n     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\n     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\n     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\n     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\n     headache, there is not much the matter with me.“Yours, etc.”“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\naloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\nshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\ntrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\nthere, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\ncarriage.”Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\nthere.”“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\nhorses?”“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”"

She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\nbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\ngood-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\nnothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\nthe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\nthinking only of his breakfast."

Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\nhowever, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\nher.When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\nnothing to do elsewhere.When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\nat parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\npresent. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\ndespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\nback a supply of clothes.[Illustration:“The Apothecary came”\n][Illustration:“covering a screen”\n]CHAPTER VIII.[Illustration]At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\nindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike."

His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\nattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\neat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\npronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\nshe had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\nthought the same, and added,--“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\nlooked almost wild.”“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\nin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\nhide it not doing its office.”“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\nwhen she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\nescaped my notice.”“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\nan exhibition.”“Certainly not.”“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\na most country-town indifference to decorum.”“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\nBingley.“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\neyes.”“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--"

But with such\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\nchance of it.”“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\nMeryton?”“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\nconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\ntheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\nam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\nothers; all that his library afforded."

What a delightful library you have at\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\ngenerations.”“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\nbooks.”“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\nthese.”“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.”“I wish it may.”“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\nattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\nsister, to observe the game.“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\nshe be as tall as I am?”“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\nrather taller.”“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.”“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”"
