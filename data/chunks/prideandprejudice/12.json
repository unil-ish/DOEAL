Are the others coming out?”“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.”She replied in the affirmative.“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”“Yes, she did.”“And what did she say?”“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\nmisrepresented.”“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\nElizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this\ntime of year.”“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.”“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”“And do you like her?”“Very much.”“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”"

It would have suited me in\nevery respect.”“How should you have liked making sermons?”“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\nthe exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,\nto be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the\nretirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of\nhappiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\ncircumstance when you were in Kent?”“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\nfirst, you may remember.”“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\nhad been compromised accordingly.”“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\nto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,\nshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us\nquarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\nmind.”She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\nhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.[Illustration:“Mr. Darcy with him.”\n]CHAPTER LIII.[Illustration]Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he\nnever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\nby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\nhad said enough to keep him quiet."

  "content": "The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was\nforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\nentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\ncontinue at least a twelvemonth.“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”“Write to me very often, my dear.”“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\nwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\ndo.”Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He\nsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\nthe house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\nall. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with\none’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said\nElizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\nsingle.”“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\nbut only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\nrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\narticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\nat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\nmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\nsmiled, and shook her head, by turns."

He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\nnever want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\nNetherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\nis nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\na word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in\nMeryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\nto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\ncomes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\ngoing to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\ncolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\nthere _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\nwithout it.“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come\nto a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this\nspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them."

  "content": "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you\nwill wait on him, of course.”“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\nNetherfield.“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let\nhim seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\nrunning after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\nagain.”“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\non him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\nhim.”Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\nhusband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\n_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\nbut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\nsays. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\nis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\nof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\nalways so much.”"

  "content": "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\nand fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\nthat must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\nseeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\nHertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\npaddock, and ride towards the house.Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\nto the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\nagain by her sister.“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\nknow.”“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\nhim before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\nMr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.”Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\nenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\nmother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\nGardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\nhim. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\nand whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\nbehaviour in Derbyshire."

Jane looked a little\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\ngentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her\nmother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher courtesy and address of his friend.Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied."

  "content": "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question\nwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He\nwas not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\nfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\nthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\nthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\nwith herself for being so.“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.He readily agreed to it.“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\nseen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,\nGeorge Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\nIt was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\nto make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\ncontinued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\nhard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\nplace quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\nknow how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\nhis leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\nThank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\ndeserves.”"

  "content": "Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\nof shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\nthe exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\nbefore; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\ncountry at present. A few weeks, he believed.“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\n“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\nBennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the coveys for you.”Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\nflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\nmoments of such painful confusion.“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\none or the other again!”Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\nhow much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former\nlover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\nfive minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her\nas handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\nunaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\nthat she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\nLongbourn in a few days’ time.“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\nus as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you\nI was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your\nengagement.”"

They then went away.Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\non whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\nof one who had ten thousand a year.[Illustration:“Jane happened to look round”\n]CHAPTER LIV.[Illustration]As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\nor, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects\nwhich must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed\nher.“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\n“did he come at all?”She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he\nwas in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he\nno longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think\nno more about him.”Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her\nbetter satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\neasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\nhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\nseen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent\nacquaintance.”“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!\ntake care.”“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\nyou as ever.”They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\ngood-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\nhad revived."

  "content": "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\nsportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\nthe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\ninvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\ndecided. He placed himself by her.Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\nbore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\nthe family.She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\nthan the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\ncame, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\nchance of pleasure for the evening must depend.“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\never.”"

And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\ndo we?”Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\nto help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\nbeing so silly!“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\nthese three weeks.”She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them."

I hope we\nmay often meet again.”Elizabeth smiled.“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\nany design of engaging my affection.

Come, be quick, be quick!\nwhere is your sash, my dear?”But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\nwithout one of her sisters.The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\ncustom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\nfive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\nKitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\npremeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\nfew minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”Elizabeth was forced to go."

  "content": "“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\nsoon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\nmy dressing-room.”Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\neverything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\ndaughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\naddition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\nofficiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\nforbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\ndaughter.He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\nan engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\nmeans, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the\nhappy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\nconcurrence.Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\nmorning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\nor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\neverybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\nwrite, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\nas the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\nwanted to counteract her mother’s schemes."

  "content": "But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,\nshe saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her\nmother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she\nperceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\nif engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\nthe faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\nother, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\n_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\neither; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\nBingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\nwhispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\npleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\nwhy is not everybody as happy?”Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\ndelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\nsaid, for the present.“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\nfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness?”She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\ncard-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\ncircumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\nhappiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\nfather had been short and to the purpose.“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”"

Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\nbasis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\nhimself.It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\nhow really happy he was.Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\nturned to his daughter and said,--“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\ngoodness.“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\nalways exceed your income.”“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\nunpardonable in _me_.”“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\nmore.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so\nhappy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\nthat you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\never was seen!”"

Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\nhimself obliged to accept.Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\nwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\nshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\nseparation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always\nattached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\nit possible.”“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for\nit?”“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\ncan never be what we once were to each other.”“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\nreally loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\nwould have prevented his coming down again?”“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\nmodesty.”"

If there were but such\nanother man for you!”“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\nTill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\nshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\nworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.[Illustration]CHAPTER LVI.[Illustration]"

  "content": "One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\nlawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\nshrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\nopen, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\nother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\nname to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\nintroduction had been made.Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\nfor a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\nmother?”Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\n“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\nand my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,\nwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a\nshort silence.“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\nassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\nsummer: the windows are full west.”Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\nadded,--“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\nMrs. Collins well?”“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled."

I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\nwill favour me with your company.”“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,\nattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\ndecent-looking rooms, walked on.Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\nconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\ndisagreeable.[Illustration:“After a short survey”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in\nher face.As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\nmanner:--“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\ncome.”Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account\nfor the honour of seeing you here.”"

My character has ever been\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\nafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\nyou.”“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring\nwith astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming\nso far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth\ncoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.”“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\nreport is spread abroad?”“I never heard that it was.”“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_\nmay ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\nreason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\nmay have drawn him in.”“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\nthis ever induce me to be explicit.”“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\nengaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\nmake an offer to me.”Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--"
