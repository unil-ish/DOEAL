  "content": "Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\ngo.In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\nwere immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in\na shop window, could recall them."

  "content": "But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\nMr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and\nhe bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible\nto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting\nsomething in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\npavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\ngreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\nWhat could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\nimpossible not to long to know."

  "content": "Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\nshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\ntowards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\napologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\nher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham\nappeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,\ndisagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,\nwith unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless."

  "content": "As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\nbehaviour than her sister.Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\nPhilips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\nutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.[Illustration]CHAPTER XVI.[Illustration]As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their\naunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in\nthe house.When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\nwith the housekeeper’s room."

To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\nThe gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\ngentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but\nMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.[Illustration:“The officers of the ----shire”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the\nskill of the speaker.With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\nlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\nin return, by sitting down to whist.“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\nimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very\nthankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason."

  "content": "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\nseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\nthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\nmention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\ndrop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\nunderstand.”“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\nconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”Elizabeth could not but look surprised.“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\ndisagreeable.”“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\nill-tempered man.”Wickham only shook his head."

I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\nvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\nmemory of his father.”Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry."

  "content": "“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\n“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\nmost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\nwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\nwere speaking of just now.”“Indeed!”“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\nelsewhere.”“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\nwill be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\nCertain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\nfreely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.”“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\never as he expressed them.“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”"

Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\nof preference which was often given me.”“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\nthis!”After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\nmust be dreadful.”“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can\nhardly be just to him.”Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\nfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\nwith--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\nmanner.”“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\npart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\nappears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\nand when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\nto be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”"

If from no better\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\ndishonesty I must call it.”“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\ntraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.”“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\nfather was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\ncareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.”“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\nspeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\neducation.”After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,--“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\nwho seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\nknow Mr. Bingley?”“Not at all.”“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\nDarcy is.”"

Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\nnever deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\nsincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing\nsomething for fortune and figure.”The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\nher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\nmake herself uneasy.“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\ncard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\nare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\nlittle matters.”Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\nyesterday.”“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\nself-destined to another."

She has the\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\nchooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of\nthe first class.”Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\nan end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\nWickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\nMrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\neverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\nMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\nthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.[Illustration:“delighted to see their dear friend again”\n]CHAPTER XVII.[Illustration]"

Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\nBingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\ndone but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\notherwise explained.“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or\nother, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\nwithout actual blame on either side.”“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\nbusiness? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\nsomebody.”“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a\nmanner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh no.”“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that\nMr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last\nnight; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not\nso, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\nthink.”“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.\nBingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when\nthe affair became public."

The two ladies were delighted to see\ntheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\nless on any single event, or any particular person; for though they\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\nhad no disinclination for it.“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\neverybody.”Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he\ndid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,\neither from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\ndance."

She had fully proposed being\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\ninstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;\nfor, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\ntrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement\nof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on\nTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.[Illustration]CHAPTER XVIII."

  "content": "[Illustration]Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s\npleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\nsmile,--“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\nElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\nWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\nAttention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her."

  "content": "But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\nspirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she\nhad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary\ntransition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\nparticular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\ndistress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\nsolemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\ndisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\nrelease from him was ecstasy.She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\nknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\nmind: Charlotte tried to console her.“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\nevil.”When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\nin the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\nfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\nwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\nshe made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\nwith--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\ndance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\nroom, or the number of couples.”He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\nsaid."

Perhaps, by-and-by, I\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\n_now_ we may be silent.”“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.”“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?”“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\nposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\nsaid he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\nthink it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”“I must not decide on my own performance.”He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\nthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.”The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\nfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\nconstrained manner said,--“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\n_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\nis less certain.”“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\nwith emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.”"

At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\nDarcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\nhis dancing and his partner.“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\nat her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”[Illustration:“Such very superior dancing is not\noften seen.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\nWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\nhe turned to his partner, and said,--“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking\nof.”“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\nthemselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\nand what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.”“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\nsomething else.”“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\nwith a look of doubt."

You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\ncreated_?”“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”“I hope not.”“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\nto be secure of judging properly at first.”“May I ask to what these questions tend?”“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\nto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”“And what is your success?”She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.”“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\nin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\nanother.They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\nwith an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--"

Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\nimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\nhim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\nmost infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\nwell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\nto hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\ncould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\nHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\nI wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\ndiscovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\ndescent, one could not expect much better.”“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\nsaid Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\nworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\nassure you, he informed me himself.”“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\nDarcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\nfor Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\nway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\nsister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\nyou may be sure of my pardon.”“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\nthe probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\nsister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\nregard.”“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”"

But what does he say of the living?”“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\nhim _conditionally_ only.”“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\n“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\nBingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\nboth gentlemen as I did before.”She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\ndelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\nBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\nand told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\nas to make a most important discovery.“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\nin the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”"
