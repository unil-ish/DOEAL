And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\ndo we?”Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\nto help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\nbeing so silly!“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\nthese three weeks.”She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them."

  "content": "“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what\nsay you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I\nassure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\na haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\nLucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\nwhat do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\nat Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as\ngood a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved\ngirls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”[Illustration:“M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.”\n]Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of\nBingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The\nparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\nmay often meet again.”Elizabeth smiled.“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\ngreater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\npleasing, than any other man.”“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and\nare provoking me to it every moment.”“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in\nothers! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?”“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\nme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your\nconfidante.”[Illustration:“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.”\n]CHAPTER LV.[Illustration]A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\nten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”"

In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her\ndressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\nLizzy’s hair.”“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\nforwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\nwhere is your sash, my dear?”But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\nwithout one of her sisters.The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\ncustom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\nfive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\nKitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\npremeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\nfew minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”Elizabeth was forced to go."

  "content": "“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\nsoon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\nmy dressing-room.”Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\neverything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\ndaughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\naddition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\nofficiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\nforbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\ndaughter.He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\nan engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\nmeans, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the\nhappy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\nconcurrence.Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\nmorning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\nor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\neverybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\nwrite, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\nas the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\nwanted to counteract her mother’s schemes."

On opening the door, she\nperceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\nif engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\nthe faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\nother, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\n_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\neither; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\nBingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\nwhispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\npleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\nwhy is not everybody as happy?”Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\ndelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\nsaid, for the present.“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\nfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness?”She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\ncard-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\ncircumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\nhappiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\nfather had been short and to the purpose.“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”"

Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\nbasis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\nhimself.It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\nhow really happy he was.Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\nturned to his daughter and said,--“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\ngoodness.“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\nalways exceed your income.”“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\nunpardonable in _me_.”“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\nmore.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so\nhappy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\nthat you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\never was seen!”"

  "content": "Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\nfavourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\nhimself obliged to accept.Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\nwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\nshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\nseparation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always\nattached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\nit possible.”“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for\nit?”“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\ncan never be what we once were to each other.”“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\nreally loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\nwould have prevented his coming down again?”“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\nmodesty.”"

If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such\nanother man for you!”“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\nTill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\nshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\nworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.[Illustration]CHAPTER LVI.[Illustration]"

  "content": "One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\nlawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\nshrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\nopen, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\nother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\nname to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\nintroduction had been made.Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\nfor a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\nmother?”Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\n“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\nand my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,\nwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a\nshort silence.“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\nassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\nsummer: the windows are full west.”Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\nadded,--“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\nMrs. Collins well?”“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled."

I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\nwill favour me with your company.”“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,\nattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\ndecent-looking rooms, walked on.Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\nconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\ndisagreeable.[Illustration:“After a short survey”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in\nher face.As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\nmanner:--“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\njourney hither.

My character has ever been\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\nafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\nyou.”“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring\nwith astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming\nso far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth\ncoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.”“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\nreport is spread abroad?”“I never heard that it was.”“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_\nmay ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\nreason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\nmay have drawn him in.”“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\nthis ever induce me to be explicit.”“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\nengaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\nmake an offer to me.”Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--"

Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\npropriety and delicacy?

Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall\nnot be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to\nquit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are\nequal.”“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who\nare your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\ncondition.”“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\nmoment’s deliberation,--“I am not.”Lady Catherine seemed pleased.“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”“I will make no promise of the kind.”“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\nwill ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\nassurance I require.”“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make\n_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\nme, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on\nhis cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\nwhich you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\nfrivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\nI cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\nmine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the\nsubject.”"

I am no\nstranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a\npatched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is\n_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son\nof his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of\nwhat are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.\n“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to\nthe house.”And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\nback. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”“You are then resolved to have him?”“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any\npossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\nwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\n_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\nthe scorn.”“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I\nshall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\nambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\nreasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of\nthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\nmother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”"

She\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother\nimpatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\nShe is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to\nacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.[Illustration:“But now it comes out”\n]CHAPTER LVII.[Illustration]The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\nElizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\nhours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\nLucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\nonly set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had\nlooked forward to as possible at some future time."

From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\napplication to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\nfriend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand\nit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\nconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\nat all.”The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\nbeen, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same\nkind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and\nElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\nher was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\nconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might\nbe from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the\nconsequent explanations.She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He\nthen said,--“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\ncontents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”"

He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says\non that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\nher eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate\nmay be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages\nin this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\n‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the\nheart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and\nextensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn\nmy cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a\nprecipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,\nyou will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,\nLizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for\ncautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly\neye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\neffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\nhis life! It is admirable!”Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\nlittle agreeable to her.“Are you not diverted?”“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of\nsome family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give\nher consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my\nduty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.\nCollins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\na Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of\nChristian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear\nCharlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,\nLizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be\n_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them\nin our turn?”“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so\nstrange!”"

Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of\nhis seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.[Illustration:“The efforts of his aunt”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER LVIII.[Illustration]Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s\nvisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to\ntell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\nmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\nhabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\nset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to\noutstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\nwere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was\ntoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\ndesperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\nwhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.

I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\nwas so little to be trusted.”“You must not blame my aunt.

The\nhappiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\nbeen able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the\nexpression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but\nthough she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection\nevery moment more valuable.They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\nbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\nto the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\nevery expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\nher nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\nLadyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\nto hope before.

After abusing you so\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\nyour relations.”“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\nto you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\nevening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly\nexamined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,\nimproved in civility.”"
